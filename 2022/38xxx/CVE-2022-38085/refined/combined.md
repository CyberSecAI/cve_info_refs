### [Good plugin, but…](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/good-plugin-but-92/)

Good plugin, but won’t perform stable with my theme: Themify.
(Pro plugin btw.)
And think it needs more options:
– Gradient
– Renaming of the text, because ‘Read more’ is basically reserved for post previews, and ‘Show more’ is much more logical
– And well… wider support. I bet it works fine with Gutenberg, but that’s often not the selected method.
Best of luck!

I can’t add a new “read more”. In this form, the plug-in is useless. Please fix the problem or provide information that the plug-in works only in the pro version if that is the reason

I don’t know who Adam is, but this is by Edmond Soft, except even more deficient. My recommendation is to try Read More by Edmondsoft, it didn’t work for me but this one is crap. Also be forewarned that Read More leaves data in your database when deleted, as evidenced by the old button I made previous showing up when I installed this one. I say look elsewhere.

Sadly, I can’t get it to work with Elementor. It displays the Read More button, then the text I want to be hidden, then the Read More button below.
