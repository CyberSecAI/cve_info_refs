Based on the provided content, here's the analysis:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/activity/admin/modules/department/index.php` script, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application directly incorporates the `id` parameter from the URL into an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Direct use of user input:** The `id` parameter is used directly in the SQL query without any escaping or prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Leakage:** The provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract sensitive information like the database name (e.g., `db_wvsu`). An attacker can potentially extract other sensitive data or modify data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious GET request to `/activity/admin/modules/department/index.php` with a crafted `id` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL and vulnerable parameters.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of SQL syntax to craft injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable file is: `/activity/admin/modules/department/index.php`
*   The vulnerable parameter is: `id`
*   The provided payload is: `/activity/admin/modules/department/index.php?view=edit&id=-3' union select 1,database(),3--+`
*   The application is built using the xmapp-php5.6 version
*   The database name is `db_wvsu`
*   The application login credentials are: `admin/admin`
