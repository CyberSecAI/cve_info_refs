Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks. Specifically, the delete functionality for a category (`/index.php/contents-admin_cat-finderdel-model-ContentsCat.html?id=17`) is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized deletion of data: An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete categories or other data within the application. In the provided example the user was able to successfully delete a category.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious HTML/JavaScript: An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a request that targets the vulnerable delete functionality of the application. This can be as simple as embedding the attack URL into an `<a>` or `<input>` tag.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to host a web page or deliver malicious HTML content through other means (e.g., email) to a logged-in administrator.
- The attacker does not need to be logged into the application but must target a user that is.
- The administrator needs to be logged into the application.
