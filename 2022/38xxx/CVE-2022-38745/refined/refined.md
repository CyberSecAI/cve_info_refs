{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An empty entry in the Java class path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is due to how Apache OpenOffice handles the Java class path. An empty class path entry allows loading of classes from the current directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary Java code execution from the current directory. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, depending on the code executed.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is related to the configuration of the Java class path within the Apache OpenOffice. By adding an empty entry, the current working directory is added to the class path. This allows the execution of Java code placed in the current directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the Java class path configuration of Apache OpenOffice and place malicious java code into the current working directory. The attacker does not need to be local, but they need to be able to control the location of the running java process."
