Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-38146

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the usage of an outdated version of jQuery (1.7.2) in the Silverstripe CMS UI. This version of jQuery is vulnerable to prototype pollution (CVE-2019-11358).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Outdated Component:** The core issue is the use of an old jQuery version with known vulnerabilities.
- **Prototype Pollution:** The specific vulnerability in jQuery 1.7.2 allows an attacker to manipulate the `Object.prototype` which can lead to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session.
- **Compromise of CMS User Accounts**: By crafting malicious URLs, attackers could potentially gain control over CMS user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attack is carried out by crafting a URL with a specially crafted `__proto__` query string parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince a user (typically a CMS user) to click or follow this malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft a Malicious URL:** Attackers need to be able to generate the specially crafted URL with the vulnerable `__proto__` parameter.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** Attackers must be able to trick users into clicking on the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

- **Mitigation:** As a temporary solution, Silverstripe CMS has introduced a fix in `silverstripe/admin` 1.11.3, that stops all Javascript execution if a `__proto__` query string is present in the URL. A more complete fix by upgrading to a newer jQuery version (3.6.1 or later) is included in CMS version 4.12.0.
- **Frontend Risk:** The vulnerability can also pose a risk on the front end of a site if it uses the jQuery version that is bundled with Silverstripe CMS. In that case the theme needs to be upgraded to use a more recent version of jQuery.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability has been classified as medium severity.
