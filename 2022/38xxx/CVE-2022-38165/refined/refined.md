- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unauthenticated user can write a file with arbitrary contents to arbitrary locations on the F-Secure Policy Manager Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This vulnerability could lead to arbitrary file write on the F-Secure Policy Manager Server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated network access to the F-Secure Policy Manager server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the F-Secure Policy Manager server, no prior authentication is required.
