Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `manage_leave_type.php` script, specifically the `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, where user-provided data directly influences the SQL query executed against the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `id` in the URL: `/leave_system/admin/maintenance/manage_leave_type.php?id=`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL queries.
*   **Vulnerability Awareness:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable URL and parameter.

**Technical Details**

The provided document demonstrates how the SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited using the following payload:

`/leave_system/admin/maintenance/manage_leave_type.php?id=3%27%20and%20length(database())%20=8--+`

The payload attempts to determine the length of the database name. The `3'` part injects a single quote to break the intended query, while `and length(database())=8--+` uses the SQL `length` function to check the length of the database name. The `--+` comments out any remaining part of the original query.

The attacker can use this vulnerability to extract the database name character by character by using a series of SQL injections and changing the length parameter.

The provided images show different responses based on whether the length matches or not, confirming successful injection.
