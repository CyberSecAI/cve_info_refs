Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-38087:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `www.intel.com_ec47b6e6_20250115_083504.html` explicitly mentions `CVE-2022-38087` within its advisory regarding Intel BIOS firmware vulnerabilities. 
*   The content from `security.netapp.com_aa6eba9c_20250115_083502.html` directly addresses `CVE-2022-38087` as an Intel BIOS firmware vulnerability affecting NetApp products, and links to the Intel advisory.

*   Therefore, the provided content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from "exposure of resource to wrong sphere" within the BIOS firmware of some Intel processors. This indicates an access control issue where a resource that should be restricted to a specific security domain or privilege level is accessible from a different, less secure domain or privilege level.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Resource Access Control:** The core issue is that a resource is improperly exposed to the wrong sphere, suggesting a failure to enforce privilege separation within the BIOS firmware.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to information disclosure via local access. This means an attacker with local access to the system could potentially read sensitive data that they should not be able to access.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited through local access to the system. This suggests that the attacker needs to have some form of physical or remote console access to the affected machine.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Privileged User:**  Exploitation requires a privileged user, suggesting an attacker with administrative or similarly elevated privileges. This implies the attacker already has some level of access to the machine.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The NetApp advisory lists the affected and investigated products.
*   The Intel advisory provides additional detail including the CVSS score for the vulnerability. It lists specific Intel product collections, vertical segments, CPU IDs, and platform IDs affected by this issue.
*   Both advisories highlight the need for firmware updates to mitigate the vulnerability.

**4. Comparison to CVE Description:**
The provided content offers greater detail than what a typical CVE description provides, especially in terms of the specific affected Intel and NetApp products, the required attacker privileges, and the potential impact of the vulnerability on NetApp products.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2022-38087 involves a flaw in Intel BIOS firmware where resources are exposed to an incorrect security sphere, allowing a privileged local user to potentially disclose sensitive information. The vulnerability is addressed by applying firmware updates from the system vendor. NetApp has stated that their products are under investigation regarding the impact of this vulnerability.
