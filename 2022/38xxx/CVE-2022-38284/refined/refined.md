Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The application directly uses the arguments passed in HTTP requests in SQL queries without sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code via HTTP parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the database, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, modifying data, or deleting data.
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially bypass authentication, escalate privileges, or gain complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Parameters:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious SQL code through HTTP GET/POST parameters in the URL. Specifically, the provided image examples show that parameters used to filter the video album list or system settings list are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's web interface.
- **Authentication:** Although the attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator, the default credentials `admin:admin123` are mentioned which would allow access for any attacker aware of these default credentials.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters within the application URLs.
- **SQL Injection Expertise:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft effective malicious payloads.

**Vulnerable Routes:**
The following routes in the JFinal CMS application are identified as vulnerable:
- `admin/videoalbum/list`
- `admin/video/list`
- `system/department/list`
- `system/menu/list`
- `system/role/list`

**Additional Details:**
- The attacker has provided specific URLs demonstrating the vulnerable parameters that are susceptible to SQL injection.
- The default admin credentials of the CMS are mentioned, which could be used by an attacker to log in and exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities in the admin panel.
