## [Crow HTTP framework use-after-free](?id=753)

vulnerability:crow

**(Collaborative post by [hebi](https://github.com/0xhebi/CVEs/blob/main/Crow/CVE-2022-38667.md) and Gynvael Coldwind)**

Crow is an asynchronous C++ HTTP/WebSocket framework for creating "flask-like" web services. In early August we discovered a pretty interesting use-after-free vulnerability. Since Crow takes advantage of the [Asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/) library for asynchronous input/output operations, analysis of this vulnerability took a few long evenings since the cause was split between multiple interweaved tasks and callbacks. Eventually we traced the root cause to an interesting mismatch between two layers of code, one of which - the HTTP parser - was supporting [HTTP pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining) (or rather was agnostic towards it, which resulted in pipelining being inadvertently supported), while the other - HTTP server logic - was not designed to take HTTP pipelining into account. This resulted in some interesting "race conditions" with one task "thinking" an HTTP connection was over (and deleting objects) while another still using them while processing a separate HTTP request.

One thing to note is that we never proved exploitability (as in: actual RCE, since it's pretty easy to just trigger this vulnerability to cause a DoS) due to ENOTIME, though we believe it should be possible, if highly complex.

The vulnerability in question was reported mid-August and fixed within 6 days.

#### Original report with details

`*** Summary:
Affected: Crow version 1.0+4 and older
<https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow> - maintained version (fork)
<https://github.com/ipkn/crow> - original version
Discovered by:
hebi
Gynvael Coldwind
Method of discovery:
Fuzzing, Manual Analysis (reading the code)
"Crow is a C++ framework for creating HTTP or Websocket web services. It uses
routing similar to Python's Flask which makes it easy to use. It is also
extremely fast, beating multiple existing C++ frameworks as well as non C++
frameworks." (source: project's README.md)
Crow version 1.0+4 and older are vulnerable to a use-after-free condition due to
incorrect Connection object lifetime management (though partial HTTP pipelining
support is the deeper underlying problem). On successful exploitation this can
potentially lead to either Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure (a
failed exploitation will lead to a Denial of Service as the server will crash).
See sections below for details.
IMPORTANT: This vulnerability is reported under the 90-day policy
(version 2021), i.e. this report will be shared publicly with the defensive
community on 16th November 2022 if a patch/fix is not available by that time, or
30 days after the fix becomes available. For details please see:
<https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/04/policy-and-disclosure-2021-edition.html>
*** Crow execution model and life of a request
Note: If you understand Crow's execution model you can safely skip this section.
Note: The description below is a bit simplified and contains only the
information relevant to the vulnerability.
Crow is using an asynchronous queued task execution model (implemented using the
Asio C++ library - <https://think-async.com/Asio/>), which is not unlike typical
JavaScript model.
Technically there are actually N+1 task queues (where N denotes the number of
threads chosen by the application developer) - one per each worker thread and
an extra "main" queue for some timers, signals, etc.
When a new client is connected, the connection (represented by a Connection
object) is bound to a certain thread and its task queue. This means that all
processing done by that connection is going to happen within the constrains of
the same thread.
In case the server handles more simultaneous connections than there are threads,
each thread will handle tasks related to multiple connections. On the flip side,
if there are very few connections, then basically a connection has a task queue
(and thread) for itself.
After the connection is established (and a Connection object made) a task
tasked with receiving some data is added to the task queue. Once it completes,
the completion callback is called (that's the lambda function inside the
Connection::do_read() method in http_connection.h).
When data is received this callback passes the data to the parser (call to
parser_.feed() method; the implementation is split between parser.h and
http_parser_merged.h).
The parser (still operating within the same task) can then invoke a set of
callbacks on various parsing events like method received, URL received,
header name / value received, and so on. While all of these callbacks
are technically processed within parser.h, some of them invoke methods of the
Connection object.
Sooner (error) or later (no error) one of these called methods will end up with
a prepared ready-to-send response (e.g. a 404 response on error or 200 response
with some app-generated data on success). In such case the response will either
be immediately (synchronously) sent out or a new task will be added to the task
queue to send the response out later and call a completion callback (see the
lambda function inside the Connection::do_write()'s method).
Once the parser returns, it might either require more data (in which case a new
task to receive more data will be added to the task queue) or decide it's time
to close the connection and finish the task.
Next, if any data was asynchronously being scheduled to be sent out, a
completion callback (do_write()'s lambda) might be called. The completion
callback clears the response buffers and might close the connection as well if
needed.
The last task related to the given connection will delete the Connection object.
To summarize, the list of tasks executed while processing a connection might
look like this:
async_accept →
async_accept's completion cb (creates Connection object) →
async_receive (receive HTTP request) →
async_receive's completion cb (invokes parser/schedules sending) →
async_write (send HTTP response) →
aync_write's completion cb (deletes Connection object if needed).
There might be more async_receive related tasks if data is trickling in slowly
(multiple receives per HTTP request), and multiple async_write tasks if there
are multiple responses to be sent out (Connection: keep-alive).
As mentioned, the last task is responsible for deleting the Connection object.
To control and decide when that should happen a set of two flags is used:
Connection::is_reading
Connection::is_writing
If any receiving task is scheduled, is_reading flag is set.
If any sending task is scheduled, is_writing flag is set.
Once the tasks are complete and the connection is being closed, respective flags
are cleared.
In various places a method called Connection::check_destroy() is called, which
checks the status of both these flags. If neither is set (i.e. both are
cleared), then the Connection object is deemed to be no longed needed and is
deleted.
*** High-level root cause
In essence, the vulnerability in this report boils down to incomplete HTTP
pipelining support.
When using HTTP pipelining the client sends multiple HTTP requests as part of
the same connection one after another without waiting to receive HTTP responses
for any of the previous requests (in opposition to the "normal" way of doing it,
where only one request is sent, then the client waits for the complete response,
and only then it proceeds with the next request). In theory this allows HTTP
servers to process requests in parallel and then just send replies in order.
Historically though HTTP pipelining proved to be tricky to implement correctly
on both the client and server side. As such none of popular modern browsers have
it enabled by default.
In case of Crow the HTTP parser does support HTTP pipelining, or rather it
continues to invoke callbacks for all HTTP packets that are present in the
received TCP packet (perhaps it's more fair to say it's HTTP pipelining
agnostic).
That being said, the asynchronous Connection layer is unaware of pipelining,
which leads to various logic errors born from more than one HTTP request being
handled at the same time, while being limited to a state tailored to a single
request and response.
The simplest (and benign) way to demonstrate this is to create two endpoints
that return 512KB of "1" and "2", as shown below:
CROW_ROUTE(app, "/one")
([] {
return std::string(1024 * 512, '1');
});
CROW_ROUTE(app, "/two")
([] {
return std::string(1024 * 512, '2');
});
And then request data from both endpoints in the same TCP packet:
GET /one HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
GET /two HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
In the response we would expect (in this order):
1. HTTP response header for endpoint /one.
2. 512KB of "1"s.
3. HTTP response header for endpoint /two.
4. 512KB of "2"s.
Here's what we actually receive:
$ cat packet.http - | nc -v 127.0.0.1 18080 | hexdump -C
Connection to 127.0.0.1 18080 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

Note: The * sign above denotes a repeated row.
To present the response in a form of the list, we get:
1. HTTP response header for endpoint /one.
2. 64KB (minus response header size) of "1"s.
3. HTTP response header for endpoint /two with Content-Length set to 0.
4. The remaining amount of "1"s.
Pretty obviously responses to both packets were mixed, both in sending (HTTP
response header of /two injected in the middle of /one's response) and in
processing (Content-Length: 0 in /two's response).
Note: As mentioned before, thankfully modern browsers disabled HTTP pipelining.
Otherwise the above behavior under certain circumstances would allow for
a UXSS (or straight-up JS injection).
To summarize, the vulnerability discussed below exploits the fact that the
Connection layer isn't aware it processes multiple requests before ever
finalizing previous ones.
*** Vulnerability (use-after-free)
As mentioned before, if both the is_reading and is_writing flags are cleared,
then the next call to Connection::check_destroy() will delete the Connection
object. In case there would still be another task related to the Connection
scheduled to be executed, this would lead to a use-after-free vulnerability (and
potentially also a double-free in case Connection::check_destroy() is invoked
again).
One of the discovered ways to achieve this is to send two HTTP requests in one
TCP packet:
1. The first requests any dynamic endpoint whose response is smaller than
1MB (required to fall into a specific code path in
Connection::do_write_general()).
2. The second is both an invalid HTTP request (e.g. missing Host header) and
is referring to a non-existing endpoint (to get a 404 error response).
For example:
GET /endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
GET /idontexist HTTP/1.1
The execution for the above example will flow as follows:
async_accept →
async_accept's completion cb →
async_receive (receive HTTP request) →
- The is_reading flag is set.
async_receive's completion cb (lambda in do_read())
- The method parser_::feed() is invoked with the received data.
- ...
- Parser calls on_url callback, which in turn calls
Connection::handle_url(), which establishes a route for /endpoint.
- ...
- Parser calls on_message_complete callback, which in turn invokes the
endpoint's handler.
- After the endpoint's handler finishes, the data is scheduled to be
sent (i.e. a new "write" task is added to the task queue). This also
causes the is_writing flag to be set.
- ... parser continues with the second packet ...
- Parser calls on_url callback, which in turn calls
Connection::handle_url(), which establishes that there is no route
specified for /idontexist.
- This in turn causes a 404 packet to be scheduled to be sent to the
client (i.e. a second "write" task is added to the task queue). This
also causes the is_writing to be set (yes, it was already set).
- The Parser notices there are no headers, which is invalid for HTTP/1.1
as at least Host: is required, and exists with an error.
- Given Parser's error, the is_reading is cleared, the socket is closed,
and this tasks finishes (note: Connection object is still alive, since
is_writing is still set). →
async_write (try to send first HTTP response) →
aync_write's completion cb (lambda in do_write())
- The is_writing flag is cleared.
- Since the socket was closed (and therefore sending failed),
Connection::check_destroy() is called.
- Since both is_reading and is_writing flags are cleared, the
Connection object is deleted.
- The task finishes. →
async_write (try to send 404 HTTP response) →
async_write's completion cb (lambda in do_write())
- Attempts to access the deleted Connection object, which by this
point is already freed. Application crashes.
In case of the example packet Crow will likely crash at that point, though it
can potentially already crash when trying to execute the second scheduled
async_write (since the buffers with the response data are already deleted).
While we haven't attempted to exploit this vulnerability beyond triggering it,
we believe successful use-after-free exploitation cannot be ruled out at this
time. Exploitation would likely involve either using two Connections in the
same thread (i.e. using the same task queue) with carefully chosen order of
data transmission. Likely winning a race condition might be requires as well.
Successful exploitation of this use-after-free vulnerability would lead to
Remote Code Execution, i.e. executing arbitrary code chosen by the attacker in
the context of the Crow app's process.
*** Proposed fix:
Given that HTTP pipelining support is not needed (browsers have it blocked,
there is HTTP/2 which supports multiplexing), the best solution is to block
HTTP pipelining altogether.
This would likely require adding a mechanism to make sure that any evidence of
multiple HTTP requests within a single parser_.feed() call (as indicated by
the on_... callbacks being invoked) will result in the connection being dropped
after the first reply, and no extra HTTP request will be processed.
*** Other worrying patterns
As mentioned before, the Connection::check_destroy() function potentially
deletes the Connection object. Given this, if the object is deleted, no other
operations can be performed on it (i.e. any other operation is technically a
use-after-free).
That said, there are 3 additional places where check_destroy() is called, but
operations are still made on the object regardless.
It must be said that we were not able to find a way to actually trigger these
code paths, but these do look like accidents bound to happen some day, so
perhaps some refactoring in the area might be in order.
Place 1: End of do_write_static() function
if (close_connection_)
{
adaptor_.shutdown_readwrite();
adaptor_.close();
CROW_LOG_DEBUG << this << " from write (static)";
check_destroy();
}
res.end(); // Connection is potentially already deleted here.
res.clear();
buffers_.clear();
}
Place 2: End of do_write_general() for large (over 1MB) responses
if (close_connection_)
{
adaptor_.shutdown_readwrite();
adaptor_.close();
CROW_LOG_DEBUG << this << " from write (res_stream)";
check_destroy();
}
res.end(); // Connection is potentially already deleted here.
res.clear();
buffers_.clear();
}
}
Place 3: do_write_sync()'s completion lambda (executed before function returns)
Note: In this case the issue lies in functions calling do_write_sync() not being
aware that the Connection object might be potentially deleted in this
method.
else
{
CROW_LOG_ERROR << ec << " - happened while sending buffers";
CROW_LOG_DEBUG << this << " from write (sync)(2)";
check_destroy();
return true;
}
});
Perhaps making check_destroy() return a boolean value indicating whether the
object was or wasn't deleted might be a solution. That way the calling functions
would know whether to immediately exit, or continue execution.`

## ***Summary:***

Crow version 1.0+4 and older are vulnerable to a use-after-free condition due to
incorrect Connection object lifetime management (though partial HTTP pipelining
support is the deeper underlying problem). On successful exploitation this can
potentially lead to either Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure (a
failed exploitation will lead to a Denial of Service as the server will crash).
See sections below for details.

Affected: Crow version 1.0+4 and older

**IMPORTANT:** This vulnerability is reported under the 90-day policy
(version 2021), i.e. this report will be shared publicly with the defensive
community on 16th November 2022 if a patch/fix is not available by that time, or
30 days after the fix becomes available. For details please see:

## ***Crow execution model and life of a request***

**Note:** If you understand Crow's execution model you can safely skip this section.

**Note:** The description below is a bit simplified and contains only the
information relevant to the vulnerability.

Crow is using an asynchronous queued task execution model (implemented using the
Asio C++ library - <https://think-async.com/Asio/>), which is not unlike typical
JavaScript model.

Technically there are actually N+1 task queues (where N denotes the number of
threads chosen by the application developer) - one per each worker thread and
an extra "main" queue for some timers, signals, etc.

When a new client is connected, the connection (represented by a Connection
object) is bound to a certain thread and its task queue. This means that all
processing done by that connection is going to happen within the constrains of
the same thread.

In case the server handles more simultaneous connections than there are threads,
each thread will handle tasks related to multiple connections. On the flip side,
if there are very few connections, then basically a connection has a task queue
(and thread) for itself.

After the connection is established (and a Connection object made) a task
tasked with receiving some data is added to the task queue. Once it completes,
the completion callback is called (that's the lambda function inside the
`Connection::do_read()` method in http\_connection.h).

When data is received this callback passes the data to the parser (call to
`parser_.feed()` method; the implementation is split between parser.h and
http\_parser\_merged.h).

The parser (still operating within the same task) can then invoke a set of
callbacks on various parsing events like method received, URL received,
header name / value received, and so on. While all of these callbacks
are technically processed within parser.h, some of them invoke methods of the
Connection object.

Sooner (error) or later (no error) one of these called methods will end up with
a prepared ready-to-send response (e.g. a 404 response on error or 200 response
with some app-generated data on success). In such case the response will either
be immediately (synchronously) sent out or a new task will be added to the task
queue to send the response out later and call a completion callback (see the
lambda function inside the `Connection::do_write()`'s method).

Once the parser returns, it might either require more data (in which case a new
task to receive more data will be added to the task queue) or decide it's time
to close the connection and finish the task.

Next, if any data was asynchronously being scheduled to be sent out, a
completion callback (`do_write()`'s lambda) might be called. The completion
callback clears the response buffers and might close the connection as well if
needed.

The last task related to the given connection will delete the Connection object.

To summarize, the list of tasks executed while processing a connection might
look like this:

```
  async_accept →
    async_accept's completion cb (creates Connection object) →
      async_receive (receive HTTP request) →
        async_receive's completion cb (invokes parser/schedules sending) →
          async_write (send HTTP response) →
            aync_write's completion cb (deletes Connection object if needed).

```

There might be more async\_receive related tasks if data is trickling in slowly
(multiple receives per HTTP request), and multiple async\_write tasks if there
are multiple responses to be sent out (Connection: keep-alive).

As mentioned, the last task is responsible for deleting the Connection object.
To control and decide when that should happen a set of two flags is used:

```
  Connection::is_reading
  Connection::is_writing

```

If any receiving task is scheduled, is\_reading flag is set.
If any sending task is scheduled, is\_writing flag is set.
Once the tasks are complete and the connection is being closed, respective flags
are cleared.

In various places a method called Connection::check\_destroy() is called, which
checks the status of both these flags. If neither is set (i.e. both are
cleared), then the Connection object is deemed to be no longed needed and is
deleted.

## ***High-level root cause***

In essence, the vulnerability in this report boils down to incomplete HTTP
pipelining support.

When using HTTP pipelining the client sends multiple HTTP requests as part of
the same connection one after another without waiting to receive HTTP responses
for any of the previous requests (in opposition to the "normal" way of doing it,
where only one request is sent, then the client waits for the complete response,
and only then it proceeds with the next request). In theory this allows HTTP
servers to process requests in parallel and then just send replies in order.
Historically though HTTP pipelining proved to be tricky to implement correctly
on both the client and server side. As such none of popular modern browsers have
it enabled by default.

In case of Crow the HTTP parser does support HTTP pipelining, or rather it
continues to invoke callbacks for all HTTP packets that are present in the
received TCP packet (perhaps it's more fair to say it's HTTP pipelining
agnostic).
That being said, the asynchronous Connection layer is unaware of pipelining,
which leads to various logic errors born from more than one HTTP request being
handled at the same time, while being limited to a state tailored to a single
request and response.

The simplest (and benign) way to demonstrate this is to create two endpoints
that return 512KB of "1" and "2", as shown below:

```
  CROW_ROUTE(app, "/one")
  ([] {
    return std::string(1024 * 512, '1');
  });

  CROW_ROUTE(app, "/two")
  ([] {
    return std::string(1024 * 512, '2');
  });
```

And then request data from both endpoints in the same TCP packet:

```
GET /one HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

GET /two HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

```

In the response we would expect (in this order):

1. HTTP response header for endpoint /one.
2. 512KB of "1"s.
3. HTTP response header for endpoint /two.
4. 512KB of "2"s.

Here's what we actually receive:
```

```

**Note:** The \* sign above denotes a repeated row.

To present the response in a form of the list, we get:

1. HTTP response header for endpoint /one.
2. 64KB (minus response header size) of "1"s.
3. HTTP response header for endpoint /two with Content-Length set to 0.
4. The remaining amount of "1"s.

Pretty obviously responses to both packets were mixed, both in sending (HTTP
response header of /two injected in the middle of /one's response) and in
processing (Content-Length: 0 in /two's response).

**Note:** As mentioned before, thankfully modern browsers disabled HTTP pipelining.
Otherwise the above behavior under certain circumstances would allow for
a UXSS (or straight-up JS injection).

To summarize, the vulnerability discussed below exploits the fact that the
Connection layer isn't aware it processes multiple requests before ever
finalizing previous ones.

## ***Vulnerability (use-after-free)***

As mentioned before, if both the is\_reading and is\_writing flags are cleared,
then the next call to `Connection::check_destroy()` will delete the Connection
object. In case there would still be another task related to the Connection
scheduled to be executed, this would lead to a use-after-free vulnerability (and
potentially also a double-free in case `Connection::check_destroy()` is invoked
again).

One of the discovered ways to achieve this is to send two HTTP requests in one
TCP packet:

1. The first requests any dynamic endpoint whose response is smaller than
   1MB (required to fall into a specific code path in
   `Connection::do_write_general()`).
2. The second is both an invalid HTTP request (e.g. missing Host header) and
   is referring to a non-existing endpoint (to get a 404 error response).

For example:

```
GET /endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1

GET /idontexist HTTP/1.1

```

The execution for the above example will flow as follows:

```
async_accept →
  async_accept's completion cb →
    async_receive (receive HTTP request) →
    - The is_reading flag is set.
      async_receive's completion cb (lambda in do_read())
      - The method parser_::feed() is invoked with the received data.
        - ...
        - Parser calls on_url callback, which in turn calls
          Connection::handle_url(), which establishes a route for /endpoint.
        - ...
        - Parser calls on_message_complete callback, which in turn invokes the
          endpoint's handler.
          - After the endpoint's handler finishes, the data is scheduled to be
            sent (i.e. a new "write" task is added to the task queue). This also
            causes the is_writing flag to be set.
        - ... parser continues with the second packet ...
        - Parser calls on_url callback, which in turn calls
          Connection::handle_url(), which establishes that there is no route
          specified for /idontexist.
          - This in turn causes a 404 packet to be scheduled to be sent to the
            client (i.e. a second "write" task is added to the task queue). This
            also causes the is_writing to be set (yes, it was already set).
        - The Parser notices there are no headers, which is invalid for HTTP/1.1
          as at least Host: is required, and exists with an error.
      - Given Parser's error, the is_reading is cleared, the socket is closed,
        and this tasks finishes (note: Connection object is still alive, since
        is_writing is still set). →
        async_write (try to send first HTTP response) →
          aync_write's completion cb (lambda in do_write())
          - The is_writing flag is cleared.
          - Since the socket was closed (and therefore sending failed),
            Connection::check_destroy() is called.
            - Since both is_reading and is_writing flags are cleared, the
              Connection object is deleted.
          - The task finishes. →
          async_write (try to send 404 HTTP response) →
            async_write's completion cb (lambda in do_write())
            - Attempts to access the deleted Connection object, which by this
              point is already freed. Application crashes.

```

In case of the example packet Crow will likely crash at that point, though it
can potentially already crash when trying to execute the second scheduled
async\_write (since the buffers with the response data are already deleted).

While we haven't attempted to exploit this vulnerability beyond triggering it,
we believe successful use-after-free exploitation cannot be ruled out at this
time. Exploitation would likely involve either using two Connections in the
same thread (i.e. using the same task queue) with carefully chosen order of
data transmission. Likely winning a race condition might be requires as well.

Successful exploitation of this use-after-free vulnerability would lead to
Remote Code Execution, i.e. executing arbitrary code chosen by the attacker in
the context of the Crow app's process.

## ***Proposed fix:***

Given that HTTP pipelining support is not needed (browsers have it blocked,
there is HTTP/2 which supports multiplexing), the best solution is to block
HTTP pipelining altogether.

This would likely require adding a mechanism to make sure that any evidence of
multiple HTTP requests within a single `parser_.feed()` call (as indicated by
the on\_... callbacks being invoked) will result in the connection being dropped
after the first reply, and no extra HTTP request will be processed.

## ***Other worrying patterns***

As mentioned before, the `Connection::check_destroy()` function potentially
deletes the Connection object. Given this, if the object is deleted, no other
operations can be performed on it (i.e. any other operation is technically a
use-after-free).

That said, there are 3 additional places where `check_destroy()` is called, but
operations are still made on the object regardless.

It must be said that we were not able to find a way to actually trigger these
code paths, but these do look like accidents bound to happen some day, so
perhaps some refactoring in the area might be in order.

Place 1: End of `do_write_static()` function

```
      if (close_connection_)
      {
          adaptor_.shutdown_readwrite();
          adaptor_.close();
          CROW_LOG_DEBUG << this << " from write (static)";
          check_destroy();
      }

      res.end();  // Connection is potentially already deleted here.
      res.clear();
      buffers_.clear();
  }
```

Place 2: End of `do_write_general()` for large (over 1MB) responses

```
          if (close_connection_)
          {
              adaptor_.shutdown_readwrite();
              adaptor_.close();
              CROW_LOG_DEBUG << this << " from write (res_stream)";
              check_destroy();
          }

          res.end();  // Connection is potentially already deleted here.
          res.clear();
          buffers_.clear();
      }
  }
```

Place 3: `do_write_sync()`'s completion lambda (executed before function returns)

**Note:** In this case the issue lies in functions calling `do_write_sync()` not being
aware that the Connection object might be potentially deleted in this
method.

```
      else
      {
          CROW_LOG_ERROR << ec << " - happened while sending buffers";
          CROW_LOG_DEBUG << this << " from write (sync)(2)";
          check_destroy();
          return true;
      }
  });
```

Perhaps making `check_destroy()` return a boolean value indicating whether the
object was or wasn't deleted might be a solution. That way the calling functions
would know whether to immediately exit, or continue execution.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

* Very Fast
  + [![Benchmark Result in one chart](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e6dd946bc6d9278ebbd302c9fd37bb08b88f6726cd173240d87cf0978142e68/68747470733a2f2f646f63732e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f7370726561647368656574732f642f314b69644f395870757743525a32705f4a52444a6a326165703631483853685f4b444f684170697a76344c452f70756263686172743f6f69643d3230343134363737383926666f726d61743d696d616765)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e6dd946bc6d9278ebbd302c9fd37bb08b88f6726cd173240d87cf0978142e68/68747470733a2f2f646f63732e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f7370726561647368656574732f642f314b69644f395870757743525a32705f4a52444a6a326165703631483853685f4b444f684170697a76344c452f70756263686172743f6f69643d3230343134363737383926666f726d61743d696d616765)
  + More data on [crow-benchmark](https://github.com/ipkn/crow-benchmark)
* Fast built-in JSON parser (crow::json)
  + You can also use [json11](https://github.com/dropbox/json11) or [rapidjson](https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson) for better speed or readability
* [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) based templating library (crow::mustache)
* Header only
* Provide an amalgamated header file [`crow_all.h`](https://github.com/ipkn/crow/releases/download/v0.1/crow_all.h) with every features ([Download from here](https://github.com/ipkn/crow/releases/download/v0.1/crow_all.h))
* Middleware support
* Websocket support

## Still in development

* ~~Built-in ORM~~
  + Check [sqlpp11](https://github.com/rbock/sqlpp11) if you want one.

## Examples

#### JSON Response

```
CROW_ROUTE(app, "/json")
([]{
    crow::json::wvalue x;
    x["message"] = "Hello, World!";
    return x;
});
```

#### Arguments

```
CROW_ROUTE(app,"/hello/<int>")
([](int count){
    if (count > 100)
        return crow::response(400);
    std::ostringstream os;
    os << count << " bottles of beer!";
    return crow::response(os.str());
});
```

Handler arguments type check at compile time

```
// Compile error with message "Handler type is mismatched with URL paramters"
CROW_ROUTE(app,"/another/<int>")
([](int a, int b){
    return crow::response(500);
});
```

#### Handling JSON Requests

```
CROW_ROUTE(app, "/add_json")
.methods("POST"_method)
([](const crow::request& req){
    auto x = crow::json::load(req.body);
    if (!x)
        return crow::response(400);
    int sum = x["a"].i()+x["b"].i();
    std::ostringstream os;
    os << sum;
    return crow::response{os.str()};
});
```

## How to Build

If you just want to use crow, copy amalgamate/crow\_all.h and include it.

### Requirements

* C++ compiler with good C++11 support (tested with g++>=4.8)
* boost library
* CMake for build examples
* Linking with tcmalloc/jemalloc is recommended for speed.
* Now supporting VS2013 with limited functionality (only run-time check for url is available.)

### Building (Tests, Examples)

Out-of-source build with CMake is recommended.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

```

You can run tests with following commands:

```
ctest

```

### Installing missing dependencies

#### Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtcmalloc-minimal4 && sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4 /usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so

```

#### OSX

```
brew install boost google-perftools

```

## Description

Crow is a C++ framework for creating HTTP or Websocket web services. It uses routing similar to Python's Flask which makes it easy to use. It is also extremely fast, beating multiple existing C++ frameworks as well as non-C++ frameworks.

### Features

* Easy Routing (similar to Flask).
* Type-safe handlers.
* Blazingly fast (see [this benchmark](https://github.com/ipkn/crow-benchmark) and [this benchmark](https://github.com/guteksan/REST-CPP-benchmark)).
* Built in JSON support.
* [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) based templating library (`crow::mustache`).
* Header only library (single header file available).
* Middleware support for extensions.
* HTTP/1.1 and Websocket support.
* Multi-part request and response support.
* Uses modern C++ (11/14)

### Still in development

* [Async support](https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow/issues/258)
* [HTTP/2 support](https://github.com/crowcpp/crow/issues/8)

## Documentation

Available [here](https://crowcpp.org).

> **Warning**
>
> If you are using Crow v0.3, then you have to put `#define CROW_MAIN` at the top of one and only one source file.

## Examples

#### Hello World

```
#include "crow.h"

int main()
{
    crow::SimpleApp app;

    CROW_ROUTE(app, "/")([](){
        return "Hello world";
    });

    app.port(18080).multithreaded().run();
}
```

#### JSON Response

```
CROW_ROUTE(app, "/json")
([]{
    crow::json::wvalue x({{"message", "Hello, World!"}});
    x["message2"] = "Hello, World.. Again!";
    return x;
});
```

#### Arguments

```
CROW_ROUTE(app,"/hello/<int>")
([](int count){
    if (count > 100)
        return crow::response(400);
    std::ostringstream os;
    os << count << " bottles of beer!";
    return crow::response(os.str());
});
```

Handler arguments type check at compile time

```
// Compile error with message "Handler type is mismatched with URL parameters"
CROW_ROUTE(app,"/another/<int>")
([](int a, int b){
    return crow::response(500);
});
```

#### Handling JSON Requests

```
CROW_ROUTE(app, "/add_json")
.methods("POST"_method)
([](const crow::request& req){
    auto x = crow::json::load(req.body);
    if (!x)
        return crow::response(crow::status::BAD_REQUEST); // same as crow::response(400)
    int sum = x["a"].i()+x["b"].i();
    std::ostringstream os;
    os << sum;
    return crow::response{os.str()};
});
```

### @The-EDev **[The-EDev](/The-EDev)** commented [Aug 21, 2022](#issue-1345564164)

Fixes a potential use-after-free vulnerability where using HTTP pipelining could cause Crow to execute code related to a connection after deleting it.

It also fixes a small bug where websocket connections could be established with invalid HTTP requests (ones that don't have a `Host` header)

Thanks to hebi Gynvael Coldwind for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.

Sorry, something went wrong.

## ***Summary:***

Crow version 1.0+4 and older are vulnerable to a use-after-free condition due to
incorrect Connection object lifetime management (though partial HTTP pipelining
support is the deeper underlying problem). On successful exploitation this can
potentially lead to either Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure (a
failed exploitation will lead to a Denial of Service as the server will crash).
See sections below for details.

## ***Crow execution model and life of a request***

**Note:** If you understand Crow's execution model you can safely skip this section.
**Note:** The description below is a bit simplified and contains only the
information relevant to the vulnerability.
Crow is using an asynchronous queued task execution model (implemented using the
Asio C++ library - https://think-async.com/Asio/), which is not unlike typical
JavaScript model.
Technically there are actually N+1 task queues (where N denotes the number of
threads chosen by the application developer) - one per each worker thread and
an extra "main" queue for some timers, signals, etc.
When a new client is connected, the connection (represented by a Connection
object) is bound to a certain thread and its task queue. This means that all
processing done by that connection is going to happen within the constrains of
the same thread.
In case the server handles more simultaneous connections than there are threads,
each thread will handle tasks related to multiple connections. On the flip side,
if there are very few connections, then basically a connection has a task queue
(and thread) for itself.
After the connection is established (and a Connection object made) a task
tasked with receiving some data is added to the task queue. Once it completes,
the completion callback is called (that's the lambda function inside the
`Connection::do_read()` method in http\_connection.h).
When data is received this callback passes the data to the parser (call to
`parser_.feed()` method; the implementation is split between parser.h and
http\_parser\_merged.h).
The parser (still operating within the same task) can then invoke a set of
callbacks on various parsing events like method received, URL received,
header name / value received, and so on. While all of these callbacks
are technically processed within parser.h, some of them invoke methods of the
Connection object.
Sooner (error) or later (no error) one of these called methods will end up with
a prepared ready-to-send response (e.g. a 404 response on error or 200 response
with some app-generated data on success). In such case the response will either
be immediately (synchronously) sent out or a new task will be added to the task
queue to send the response out later and call a completion callback (see the
lambda function inside the `Connection::do_write()`'s method).
Once the parser returns, it might either require more data (in which case a new
task to receive more data will be added to the task queue) or decide it's time
to close the connection and finish the task.
Next, if any data was asynchronously being scheduled to be sent out, a
completion callback (`do_write()`'s lambda) might be called. The completion
callback clears the response buffers and might close the connection as well if
needed.
The last task related to the given connection will delete the Connection object.
To summarize, the list of tasks executed while processing a connection might
look like this:
```
async\_accept →
async\_accept's completion cb (creates Connection object) →
async\_receive (receive HTTP request) →
async\_receive's completion cb (invokes parser/schedules sending) →
async\_write (send HTTP response) →
aync\_write's completion cb (deletes Connection object if needed).
```
There might be more async\_receive related tasks if data is trickling in slowly
(multiple receives per HTTP request), and multiple async\_write tasks if there
are multiple responses to be sent out (Connection: keep-alive).
As mentioned, the last task is responsible for deleting the Connection object.
To control and decide when that should happen a set of two flags is used:
```
Connection::is\_reading
Connection::is\_writing
```
If any receiving task is scheduled, is\_reading flag is set.
If any sending task is scheduled, is\_writing flag is set.
Once the tasks are complete and the connection is being closed, respective flags
are cleared.
In various places a method called Connection::check\_destroy() is called, which
checks the status of both these flags. If neither is set (i.e. both are
cleared), then the Connection object is deemed to be no longed needed and is
deleted.
## ***High-level root cause***

In essence, the vulnerability in this report boils down to incomplete HTTP
pipelining support.
When using HTTP pipelining the client sends multiple HTTP requests as part of
the same connection one after another without waiting to receive HTTP responses
for any of the previous requests (in opposition to the "normal" way of doing it,
where only one request is sent, then the client waits for the complete response,
and only then it proceeds with the next request). In theory this allows HTTP
servers to process requests in parallel and then just send replies in order.
Historically though HTTP pipelining proved to be tricky to implement correctly
on both the client and server side. As such none of popular modern browsers have
it enabled by default.
In case of Crow the HTTP parser does support HTTP pipelining, or rather it
continues to invoke callbacks for all HTTP packets that are present in the
received TCP packet (perhaps it's more fair to say it's HTTP pipelining
agnostic).
That being said, the asynchronous Connection layer is unaware of pipelining,
which leads to various logic errors born from more than one HTTP request being
handled at the same time, while being limited to a state tailored to a single
request and response.
The simplest (and benign) way to demonstrate this is to create two endpoints
that return 512KB of "1" and "2", as shown below:
```c++
CROW\_ROUTE(app, "/one")
([] {
return std::string(1024 \* 512, '1');
});
CROW\_ROUTE(app, "/two")
([] {
return std::string(1024 \* 512, '2');
});
```
And then request data from both endpoints in the same TCP packet:
```
GET /one HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
GET /two HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
In the response we would expect (in this order):

1. HTTP response header for endpoint /one.
2. 512KB of "1"s.
3. HTTP response header for endpoint /two.
4. 512KB of "2"s.

Here's what we actually receive:
```
$ cat packet.http - | nc -v 127.0.0.1 18080 | hexdump -C
Connection to 127.0.0.1 18080 port [tcp/\*] succeeded!

```
**Note:** The \* sign above denotes a repeated row.
To present the response in a form of the list, we get:

1. HTTP response header for endpoint /one.
2. 64KB (minus response header size) of "1"s.
3. HTTP response header for endpoint /two with Content-Length set to 0.
4. The remaining amount of "1"s.

Pretty obviously responses to both packets were mixed, both in sending (HTTP
response header of /two injected in the middle of /one's response) and in
processing (Content-Length: 0 in /two's response).
**Note:** As mentioned before, thankfully modern browsers disabled HTTP pipelining.
Otherwise the above behavior under certain circumstances would allow for
a UXSS (or straight-up JS injection).
To summarize, the vulnerability discussed below exploits the fact that the
Connection layer isn't aware it processes multiple requests before ever
finalizing previous ones.
## ***Vulnerability (use-after-free)***

As mentioned before, if both the is\_reading and is\_writing flags are cleared,
then the next call to `Connection::check_destroy()` will delete the Connection
object. In case there would still be another task related to the Connection
scheduled to be executed, this would lead to a use-after-free vulnerability (and
potentially also a double-free in case `Connection::check_destroy()` is invoked
again).
One of the discovered ways to achieve this is to send two HTTP requests in one
TCP packet:

1. The first requests any dynamic endpoint whose response is smaller than
   1MB (required to fall into a specific code path in
   `Connection::do_write_general()`).
2. The second is both an invalid HTTP request (e.g. missing Host header) and
   is referring to a non-existing endpoint (to get a 404 error response).

For example:
```
GET /endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
GET /idontexist HTTP/1.1
```
The execution for the above example will flow as follows:
```
async\_accept →
async\_accept's completion cb →
async\_receive (receive HTTP request) →
- The is\_reading flag is set.
async\_receive's completion cb (lambda in do\_read())
- The method parser\_::feed() is invoked with the received data.
- ...
- Parser calls on\_url callback, which in turn calls
Connection::handle\_url(), which establishes a route for /endpoint.
- ...
- Parser calls on\_message\_complete callback, which in turn invokes the
endpoint's handler.
- After the endpoint's handler finishes, the data is scheduled to be
sent (i.e. a new "write" task is added to the task queue). This also
causes the is\_writing flag to be set.
- ... parser continues with the second packet ...
- Parser calls on\_url callback, which in turn calls
Connection::handle\_url(), which establishes that there is no route
specified for /idontexist.
- This in turn causes a 404 packet to be scheduled to be sent to the
client (i.e. a second "write" task is added to the task queue). This
also causes the is\_writing to be set (yes, it was already set).
- The Parser notices there are no headers, which is invalid for HTTP/1.1
as at least Host: is required, and exists with an error.
- Given Parser's error, the is\_reading is cleared, the socket is closed,
and this tasks finishes (note: Connection object is still alive, since
is\_writing is still set). →
async\_write (try to send first HTTP response) →
aync\_write's completion cb (lambda in do\_write())
- The is\_writing flag is cleared.
- Since the socket was closed (and therefore sending failed),
Connection::check\_destroy() is called.
- Since both is\_reading and is\_writing flags are cleared, the
Connection object is deleted.
- The task finishes. →
async\_write (try to send 404 HTTP response) →
async\_write's completion cb (lambda in do\_write())
- Attempts to access the deleted Connection object, which by this
point is already freed. Application crashes.
```
In case of the example packet Crow will likely crash at that point, though it
can potentially already crash when trying to execute the second scheduled
async\_write (since the buffers with the response data are already deleted).
While we haven't attempted to exploit this vulnerability beyond triggering it,
we believe successful use-after-free exploitation cannot be ruled out at this
time. Exploitation would likely involve either using two Connections in the
same thread (i.e. using the same task queue) with carefully chosen order of
data transmission. Likely winning a race condition might be requires as well.
Successful exploitation of this use-after-free vulnerability would lead to
Remote Code Execution, i.e. executing arbitrary code chosen by the attacker in
the context of the Crow app's process.
## ***Proposed fix:***

Given that HTTP pipelining support is not needed (browsers have it blocked,
there is HTTP/2 which supports multiplexing), the best solution is to block
HTTP pipelining altogether.
This would likely require adding a mechanism to make sure that any evidence of
multiple HTTP requests within a single `parser_.feed()` call (as indicated by
the on\_... callbacks being invoked) will result in the connection being dropped
after the first reply, and no extra HTTP request will be processed.
## ***Other worrying patterns***

As mentioned before, the `Connection::check_destroy()` function potentially
deletes the Connection object. Given this, if the object is deleted, no other
operations can be performed on it (i.e. any other operation is technically a
use-after-free).
That said, there are 3 additional places where `check_destroy()` is called, but
operations are still made on the object regardless.
It must be said that we were not able to find a way to actually trigger these
code paths, but these do look like accidents bound to happen some day, so
perhaps some refactoring in the area might be in order.
Place 1: End of `do_write_static()` function
```c++
if (close\_connection\_)
{
adaptor\_.shutdown\_readwrite();
adaptor\_.close();
CROW\_LOG\_DEBUG << this << " from write (static)";
check\_destroy();
}
res.end(); // Connection is potentially already deleted here.
res.clear();
buffers\_.clear();
}
```
Place 2: End of `do_write_general()` for large (over 1MB) responses
```c++
if (close\_connection\_)
{
adaptor\_.shutdown\_readwrite();
adaptor\_.close();
CROW\_LOG\_DEBUG << this << " from write (res\_stream)";
check\_destroy();
}
res.end(); // Connection is potentially already deleted here.
res.clear();
buffers\_.clear();
}
}
```
Place 3: `do_write_sync()`'s completion lambda (executed before function returns)
**Note:** In this case the issue lies in functions calling `do_write_sync()` not being
aware that the Connection object might be potentially deleted in this
method.
```c++
else
{
CROW\_LOG\_ERROR << ec << " - happened while sending buffers";
CROW\_LOG\_DEBUG << this << " from write (sync)(2)";
check\_destroy();
return true;
}
});
```
Perhaps making `check_destroy()` return a boolean value indicating whether the
object was or wasn't deleted might be a solution. That way the calling functions
would know whether to immediately exit, or continue execution.
