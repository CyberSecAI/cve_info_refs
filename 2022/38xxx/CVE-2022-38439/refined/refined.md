- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link, and have low privileges on the system. User interaction (UI:R) is required for exploitation. The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
