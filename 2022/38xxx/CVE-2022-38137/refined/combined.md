### Notes

Analytify is the best Google Analytics plugin for WordPress. We make Google Analytics look EASY. You know all about Google Analytics and love the data it provides, but wouldn’t it be nice if there is a tool to make managing all of that complex information simpler?

You’re in luck.

Google Analytics Was Never This Fun In WordPress before.

Following is a list of Testimonials you must read them once.

Testimonial # 1

**Great way to understand your audience**

I’ve been using the Pro version for quite a while. I really love how it gives me in-depth information about each individual post. That kind of info is hard to navigate to in Google Analytics even if you’re relatively familiar with it already. I discovered all kinds of new things about how people land on my site and how they engage with it just by activating the plugin and looking at the information it provides in the Dashboard and on individual posts.

The author is also an official Google analytics Partner, which I think speaks volumes. Well done all around, highly recommended!

Testimonial # 2

**Best Google Analytics Plugin**

This is something that clients really love as they of course want to see traffic to their site. However many do not want to log into google analytics and work their way through its rather complicated reporting modules. This gives all the headline stuff and more. What’s really neat is that it does it for every single page as well. So you can really see what’s going on for a particular post. So a google search for X led to this page. It also has great realtime reporting for the paid version. I had one small issue and the developer responded and addressed it immediately. Very impressed. It’s become a default plugin.

Testimonial # 3

**Excellent Integrations with Google Analytics**

Many of my clients don’t want to view analytics outside their dashboard. This plugin integrates GA beautifully within the WordPress admin panel. I suggest you give it a spin. The developers are also very nice and dedicated to the plugin, which goes a long way.

Testimonial # 4

**Outstanding support and product**

Besides thinking the plugin is wonderful, I am equally impressed with the support team. I had issues and they emailed back and forth to resolve my issues and even update the plugin for me. I highly recommend this plugin which has been very beneficial to my analytics, but just as important, I appreciate the support in resolving my issue in a very timely manner.

## FAQ

### What is Google Analytics4 or GA4?

A new upgraded version of Google Analytics introduced 4 key features: Smarter Insights, Deep integration with Google Ads, Customer-Centric data measurement, and Data controls. GA4 tracking id looks like G-XXXXXXXXXX.

### Does this plugin support Google Analytics4?

Yes, you can track data in GA4, but you must need Universal Analytics for reports to be visible in WordPress. So, We wrote an article to [create both properties in Google Analytics and connect each other](https://analytify.io/doc/integrate-google-analytics-4-with-universal-analytics/?utm_source=wp-org&utm_medium=FAQ&utm_campaign=pro-upgrade&utm_content=Support+GA4). i.e., Universal Analytics UA and Google Analytics GA4 property.

### Should I use the old Google Analytics UA script (analytics.js) or the new Global Site Tag (gtags.js) in 2021?

We recommend using gtag.js as the Google Analytics team also advises this. If you have written custom tracking scripts in Universal Analytics, you need to use UA analytics.js, and it is better to rewrite them in gtag.js as old UA analytics.js will obsolete. That’s how we moved our tracking codes from analytics.js to gtag.js

### Does your plugin support the new Global Site Tag (gtag.js)?

Yes, Analytify started inserting new gtag.js by default on the plugin installation. But we have an analytics.js option as well for backward compatibility.

### Should I install a Google Analytics plugin, or can I insert Google analytics tracking JS code in my WordPress theme?

You can add Google Analytics JS code in your theme, but We recommend using Analytify; you connect your Google Analytics account with Analytify. It will insert the Google Analytics tracking code after selecting your website profile from the plugin settings, profile tab. Analytify pulls your website analytics from Google Analytics and flaunts it in WordPress Dashboard.

### Google Analytics says tracking code is not detected

If you check the source code of your pages and don’t see the Google Analytics tracking code, check the following:

* Check that your theme includes the hooks, `wp_head` and `wp_footer`
* Double check the “Install Google Analytics tracking code” option is ON.
* If you are using a caching plugin, try clearing the cache.
* You might be logged in as an administrator, and that user is excluded from tracking.

If the GA tracking code is still not displayed, there is likely interference from another plugin. Please submit a support request on our site or here.

### Do I need to have an account on Google Analytics to start tracking my website?

Yes, a Google Analytics account is necessary to track your website. We wrote a detailed guide on [How to set up a Google Analytics account](https://analytify.io/how-to-setup-your-account-at-google-analytics/?utm_source=wp-org&utm_medium=FAQ&utm_campaign=pro-upgrade&utm_content=Setup+Account). It will help in understanding Google Analytics in particular.

### How to Authenticate and Connect my Google Analytics Account with Analytify?

Go to plugin Analytify->settings page and see the Authentication tab. Click the “Log in with Google Analytics Account” button, connect and give Analytify app access to your Google Analytics account.

### How to select Google Analytics website profiles in the plugin?

First, you need to authenticate your Google Analytics account, and then you can choose your website profiles from the plugin settings, profiles tab in Analytify->settings page.

### Does your plugin support the WPML or any WordPress Multilingual sites?

Yes, It is Multilingual compatible, and this supports the WPML plugin too.

### How to set up Google Optimize using this plugin

With the Analytify plugin, you can easily connect Google optimize with Google Analytics for A/B testing.

We wrote a detailed guide on [Setting up Google Optimize.](https://analytify.io/doc/how-to-set-up-google-optimize-with-analytify/?utm_source=wp-org&utm_medium=FAQ&utm_campaign=pro-upgrade&utm_content=Google+Optimize).

### How much time will it take to see the data in Google Analytics or Analytify Dashboards?

Wait till 24 hours, or better, you see the real-time analytics dashboard.

### Does Analytify affect my website loading speed?

No, Let me explain. All the code assets like JS/CSS/etc. are loaded only on Analytify plugin pages. It inserts Google Analytics Universal/Global Site Tag tracking JS code to track every event on the front end of the website. Nothing stores in your database. Data pull from Google Analytics and display in Analytify dashboards. To cache them for 24 hours on the dashboard, you can enable an option from plugin settings, dashboard tab.

### What does mean by “(not set)” in Google Analytics

You probably see the “not set” many times while going through your Google Analytics reports, Sometimes it bothers you.

The “not set” Value in Google Analytics means when Google Analytics failed to receive enough information about a specific dimension. These dimensions might be referral URL, Browsers, Geographics, etc.

Google Analytics fails to receive such information because sometimes the customer does not allow the cookies on his site.

### Does Analytify provide full support for the free version plugin?

Nice plugin but have limited insights. We can see these events or results easily in the ga4 by just few clicks. So why we are going to paid options? 🤔

I switched all my sites over to Analytify a couple of years ago and I’m glad I did. Being able to provide my clients with some basic Google Analytics reports right on their dashboard is perfect. Most just want some reassurance that the site is getting traffic, and the Dashboard widget does the job. And when a client wants a bit more than that, the additional pages of reports help to provide deeper insight. All without having to have a separate Google Analytics login or have to learn how to generate reports.

Great work, the plugin brings all the information we need from GA. But it still has a lot to offer, and we look forward to staff working in these new roles.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
