{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's XSS filter attempts to sanitize user input by blacklisting specific keywords, but this can be circumvented through encoding and using spurious protocols.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored XSS vulnerability",
    "Insufficient input sanitization",
    "Circumventable blacklist-based filtering"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which can be executed in the browsers of other users. This allows the attacker to steal cookies, which can be used to impersonate other users and gain access to their accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious payload disguised as a base64 encoded script within a 'Twitter' function. This script bypasses the naive filter due to encoding and the use of a spurious protocol (data:text/html;base64)",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to post data to the 'Twitter' functionality and understand how the XSS filter operates so they can use encoding to bypass it."
