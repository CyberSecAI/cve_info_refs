Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-38813:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-38813. Multiple sources describe the vulnerability as a vertical privilege escalation in the Blood Donor Management System (BDMS) using CodeIgniter, version 1.0. This matches the CVE description, which mentions improper access control.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper access control in the BDMS application. Specifically, the `user/dashboard.php` and `admin/dashboard.php` controllers don't adequately validate user roles. This allows an authenticated user to directly access the admin dashboard by manipulating the URL parameter from `user` to `admin`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The application fails to verify if the user has admin privileges before allowing access to the `admin/dashboard.php` page.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The application relies on URL parameters (`user` or `admin`) to determine access, without validating those parameters against the user's actual role.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows a normal authenticated user to:

*   Gain unauthorized access to the admin dashboard.
*   Access sensitive information, including user data and blood group records.
*   Delete user accounts.
*   Manage blood groups (add/delete).
*   Submit reports (presumably containing sensitive data).
*   Effectively take control of administrative functions of the system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:**  An attacker logs in as a normal user, then modifies the URL from `http://localhost/blood/user/dashboard` to `http://localhost/blood/admin/dashboard`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid user account for the BDMS application.
*   **Basic Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL structure (`/user/dashboard` and `/admin/dashboard`).
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker needs a web browser to perform the attack.

**Additional Technical Details (beyond CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `Dashboard.php` controllers for both user and admin areas. The user controller only checks if a user is logged in, not their role.
*   The provided exploit script automates the attack, logging in a user and then trying to access the admin dashboard with the modified URL.
*   The exploit proof of concept screenshot shows the user profile page from the dashboard.
*   The GitHub repository containing the exploit code provides a complete view of the attack vector, along with source code snippets highlighting the vulnerable code in php.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `index()` function of both the user and admin dashboard controllers.
*   The exploit simply bypasses the authorization check.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability is a classic example of a vertical privilege escalation due to improper access control. A simple URL manipulation allows a normal user to gain administrative access, highlighting a critical security flaw in the application's design. The content provides the exact code, steps to reproduce and also a python script to automate this vulnerability.
