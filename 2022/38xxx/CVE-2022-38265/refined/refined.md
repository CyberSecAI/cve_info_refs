Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `editid` parameter of the `/avms/edit-apartment.php` script before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `editid` parameter.
*   **Direct use of user input in SQL query:** The application directly embeds user-controlled data into a SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. In this specific example, the provided payload is used to reveal the database name.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** While not demonstrated in this specific example, SQL injection can also lead to the attacker modifying or deleting data.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain further access to the system.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/avms/edit-apartment.php` script with the SQL injection payload in the `editid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Basic knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs to know SQL syntax to craft a successful injection.
*   **No prior authentication required:** The vulnerability appears to be exploitable without prior authentication

**Payload Example:**

```
/avms/edit-apartment.php?editid=-20%27%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4--+
```
This payload uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject a query that reveals the database name.
