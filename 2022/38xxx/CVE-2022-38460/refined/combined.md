Version 5.9.1 – Word Press
Went to pages and typed [notice\_board] but my notices do not display. I would like to display them in the middle of the page on the left side. We are also using Divi but that has not caused any other issues with other plugins. I want to create a running list of employee notifications – but only show the last 5/6 notices.

As far as the plugin goes right now, it is nearly perfect (but 4-1/2 stars is not allowed). To be absolutely perfect for my needs, however, it would need to be able to filter by categories so that I could have different pages that list different types of notices. For example, I would like to be able to have one page that lists notices regarding meetings, another that lists notices regarding newsletters, a separate page for each of the organizations that subscribe to our site, etc.
I have found a modification of this plugin by another developer that appears to do this, but this modification was developed six months ago, and I do not know if it will work with the recent update to this plugin.
