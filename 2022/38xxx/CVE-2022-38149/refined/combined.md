**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2022-16

**Affected Products / Versions:** Consul Template up to 0.27.2, 0.28.2, and 0.29.1; fixed in 0.27.3, 0.28.3, and 0.29.2.

**Publication Date:** August 16, 2022

**Summary**

A vulnerability was identified in Consul Template such that invalid template contents can reveal the contents of a Vault secret. This vulnerability, CVE-2022-38149, was fixed in Consul Template 0.27.3, 0.28.3, and 0.29.2.

**Background**

Consul Templates provides a programmatic method for rendering configuration files from a variety of locations, including Vault. It may be used as either a library, or a command-line application. For more information, see the [tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/consul-template).

**Details**

An external party reported that invalid templates could inadvertently reveal the contents of Vault secret in errors returned by the [\*template.Template.Execute](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/template#Template.Execute) method, when given a template using Vault secret contents incorrectly. This method has been updated to redact Vault secrets when creating an error string, making it safe to log the error.

**Remediation**

Customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Consul Template 0.27.3, 0.28.3, and 0.29.2, or newer.

**Acknowledgement**

HashiCorp thanks Fulton Byrne at Commercetools GmbH for identifying and reporting this issue.
