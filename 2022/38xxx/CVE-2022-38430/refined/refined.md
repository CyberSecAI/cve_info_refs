- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local and requires user interaction
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to convince a user to open a crafted file using a vulnerable version of the software.
