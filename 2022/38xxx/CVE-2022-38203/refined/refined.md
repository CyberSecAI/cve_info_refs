- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Protections against potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities were not fully honored.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can forge requests to arbitrary URLs from the system, potentially leading to network enumeration or reading from hosts inside the network perimeter.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send malicious requests to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Esri Portal for ArcGIS instance. No specific user privileges are required, as the vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated user.
