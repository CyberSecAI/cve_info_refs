```
- Root cause of vulnerability: An integer overflow vulnerability exists within the RFC3164 parser of syslog-ng.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflow leading to a denial-of-service.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted syslog messages that trigger an infinite loop consuming 100% CPU time. If all worker threads are affected, syslog-ng will stop processing messages, hindering threat detection.
- Attack vectors: Sending a malformed RFC3164-style syslog message to a vulnerable syslog-ng instance over the network.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a syslog-ng instance that accepts RFC3164 style syslog messages.
