    "relevance": "RELATED",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Docker Desktop application is vulnerable to a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. When the Docker daemon creates a directory and then creates files inside, a malicious user can replace the directory with a junction directory pointing to any location they want. After the daemon creates files in the attacker-controlled junction, they gain access to arbitrary locations inside the host system and can cause a denial of service or other malicious activities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race Condition",
        "Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability",
        "Arbitrary File Overwrite"
      ],
      "impact": "Privilege Escalation leading to arbitrary file overwrite and denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "By creating a crafted `daemon.json` file with a malicious `data-root` path, an attacker can force the Docker daemon (dockerd) to create directories under their control. Then, using object manager symlinks, they can cause a TOCTOU vulnerability and overwrite files in any location.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "A low-privilege user capable of sending API requests to the Docker daemon in Windows."
