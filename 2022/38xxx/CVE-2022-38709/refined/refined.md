- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) through DOM manipulation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XSS vulnerability that can be exploited through DOM manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for cross-site scripting attacks, potentially leading to malicious script execution in the context of the user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through DOM manipulation, meaning that the attacker would need to inject malicious code into the DOM elements of the web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code that would then be executed via the DOM manipulation vulnerability.
