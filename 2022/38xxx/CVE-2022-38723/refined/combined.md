### What’s new in Gravitee Access Management 3.15

The Gravitee Access Management team has been hard at work on AM v 3.15, and we’ve delivered two new features that will help your teams harden the security of your APIs::

* CIBA Flow
* Security improvements

Keep reading to learn more!

### Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA)

The Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow — Core 1.0 (CIBA) is an authentication flow governing how users are identified and granted access to a resource or service. The Relying Party communicates with an OpenID Provider without redirecting the user to a different site on their browser. or example, somebody might buy goods from an online store and then being redirected to their bank’s website to authorize the purchase.

Why this matters

There are many benefits from decoupling the flows between user interactions with an intended service and the user authentication, including:

* The user experience is enhanced by not being redirected to a different site
* The user is safer, as authentication can take place without sharing specific personally identifiable and sensitive information such as address or date of birth.

This specification has the concept of a Consumption Device (on which the user interacts with the Relying Party) and an Authentication Device (on which the user authenticates with the OpenID Provider and grants consent).

A Simplified CIBA Flow: real-life use cases

The following use cases provide great examples of how CIBA can be used to improve both security and user experience:

1. A call center agent wants to authenticate a caller. Using additional information such as “profile” or “phone”, the agent can get access confirmation about the user, e.g. “phone\_number” and “phone\_number\_verified”.
2. A bank teller wants to authenticate a customer at a bank branch — using CIBA for authentication in a face-to-face scenario.
3. A user wants to use their smartphone to authorize a payment they are making at a point of sale terminal.

In all of these use cases, CIBA helps API teams and organizations to comply with legal frameworks by defining a protocol that can be used to implement a decoupled approach described in PSD2 (dynamic linking).

For more information about CIBA and getting started with CIBA flows, check out our [user guide](https://docs.gravitee.io/am/current/am_devguide_protocols_ciba_overview.html).

### Security improvements

To ensure that our users get the best experience, we’ve made some important security improvements.

#### Password policy enhancement

Gravitee Access Management v3.15 introduces a password dictionary. With the dictionary common, unsafe passwords are excluded. We have also added an option to ensure that a user’s password does not contain user profile information. Not only does this make it easier for your internal teams to build advanced security measures into your APIs and applications, but it also adds another layer of confidence for the consumers of your APIs and applications regarding the safety of the product that they are using.

For more information about designing password policies, check out our [user guide](https://docs.gravitee.io/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_password_policy.html#password_dictionary).

#### Sensitive data management

We know that masking sensitive data is important to high-security organizations. That’s why we’ve added a new “sensitive” flag in the plugins configuration. This new capability will enable the masking of potentially sensitive data being exposed by the [Gravitee.io](http://Gravitee.io) Access Management Console and REST API.

In addition to this, we’ve automated the management of system resources (such as the default identity provider and default reporter) upon changing your main repository database to cut out the need for labor intensive, less secure manual changes.

### Wrapping up

This was a quick tour of two hot new features in our latest release. To try out these and other new features in 3.15, check out the [installation guide](https://docs.gravitee.io/am/current/am_installguide_introduction.html) or start exploring [Gravitee.io](http://Gravitee.io) with the [Docker](https://docs.gravitee.io/am/current/am_installguide_docker_compose.html#run_am_with_a_single_command) image. And, don’t forget, if you have any questions, or want to discuss these features and more, do reach out on our [new community forum](https://community.gravitee.io).
