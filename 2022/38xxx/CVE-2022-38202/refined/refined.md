- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly validate user-supplied input allowing an attacker to traverse the file system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can traverse the file system to access files outside of the intended directory on ArcGIS Server. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive site configuration information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and does not require any special privileges.
