- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the exposure of insecure HTTP methods, specifically OPTIONS, DELETE, TRACE, and PUT, within the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of insecure HTTP methods.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The impact is rated as low, with a potential for information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent network access (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target system (adjacent access). The complexity is rated as high (AC:H), meaning that specialized access conditions or mitigation must be present, or that an attacker must expend significant effort to exploit the vulnerability. No special privileges are required to exploit it (PR:N) and user interaction is not needed (UI:N). The scope is unchanged (S:U). The confidentiality impact is low (C:L) and there is no impact on integrity (I:N) or availability (A:N).

The CVSS score is 3.1 with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
