Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-38398:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue, specifically related to the processing of URLs with the `jar` protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The core weakness is the ability of an attacker to manipulate the application to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources by exploiting the processing of URLs with the `jar` protocol.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can force the server to make arbitrary GET requests. This could lead to:
    *   Accessing internal resources that are not intended to be exposed.
    *   Interacting with internal services.
    *   Potentially exfiltrating sensitive data.
    *   Resource consumption by making requests to external/internal services.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a malicious SVG file that leverages the processing of URLs with the `jar` protocol to trigger the SSRF vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the SVG content processed by the vulnerable application. This could involve:
    *   Uploading a malicious SVG file.
    *   Tricking a user into viewing a malicious SVG file.
    *   Injecting a malicious SVG into a webpage that is then processed by the application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 3619-1) specifically mentions that an attacker can load a URL using the `jar` protocol.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202401-11) indicates that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable and part of a set of vulnerabilities affecting versions of Apache Batik prior to 1.17.
