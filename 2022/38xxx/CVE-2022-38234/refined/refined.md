  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A segmentation fault occurs within the `Lexer::getObj` function, likely due to an invalid memory access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code attempts to dereference a high value address, leading to a segmentation fault. This suggests a memory corruption or out-of-bounds read issue.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The application crashes due to a segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PDF file. The attacker would need to provide a malicious PDF to the vulnerable application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted PDF file to the vulnerable application, pdftops in this case. No special privileges are required."
