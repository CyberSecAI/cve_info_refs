- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in Adobe Animate.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), with low attack complexity (AC:L). User interaction (UI:R) is required. The vulnerability requires no privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to entice a user to open a specially crafted file. The attacker needs to be local to the system and needs to have the user execute the file.
