- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unvalidated redirect vulnerability exists in Esri ArcGIS Quick Capture Web Designer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unvalidated redirect (CWE-601).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can induce an unsuspecting authenticated user to access an attacker-controlled domain. This could potentially lead to phishing or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. The attacker could send a crafted URL to a user, which upon being clicked, would redirect the user to an attacker-controlled domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be remote and unauthenticated, and be able to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link.
