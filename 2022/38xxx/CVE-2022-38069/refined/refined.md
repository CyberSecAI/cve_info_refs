- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device uses hard-coded credentials across all devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A threat actor with physical access can gain privileged access, potentially extracting sensitive patient information or modifying device parameters.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs momentary physical access to the device.
