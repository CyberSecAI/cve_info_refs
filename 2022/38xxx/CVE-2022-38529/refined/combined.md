### **[0xdd96](/0xdd96)** commented [Jul 6, 2022](#issuecomment-1175768917)

| Before calling `rleUncompress`, `src_size=0x64` in the PoC, bypassing the check (line 1616) introduced in the patch for [#112](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr/issues/112).     [tinyexr/tinyexr.h](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr/blob/0647fb3e0e65d21af354b43bdd9a0acf2913a996/tinyexr.h#L1614-L1618)  Lines 1614 to 1618 in [0647fb3](/syoyo/tinyexr/commit/0647fb3e0e65d21af354b43bdd9a0acf2913a996)   |  | // Workaround for issue #112. | | --- | --- | |  | // TODO(syoyo): Add more robust out-of-bounds check in `rleUncompress`. | |  | if (src\_size <= 2) { | |  | return false; | |  | } |      However, `inLength` is still set to -1 in line 1518 and heap buffer overflow in line 1522.     [tinyexr/tinyexr.h](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr/blob/0647fb3e0e65d21af354b43bdd9a0acf2913a996/tinyexr.h#L1501-L1527)  Lines 1501 to 1527 in [0647fb3](/syoyo/tinyexr/commit/0647fb3e0e65d21af354b43bdd9a0acf2913a996)   |  | static int rleUncompress(int inLength, int maxLength, const signed char in[], | | --- | --- | |  | char out[]) { | |  | char \*outStart = out; | |  |  | |  | while (inLength > 0) { | |  | if (\*in < 0) { | |  | int count = -(static\_cast<int>(\*in++)); | |  | inLength -= count + 1; | |  |  | |  | // Fixes #116: Add bounds check to in buffer. | |  | if ((0 > (maxLength -= count)) || (inLength < 0)) return 0; | |  |  | |  | memcpy(out, in, count); | |  | out += count; | |  | in += count; | |  | } else { | |  | int count = \*in++; | |  | inLength -= 2; | |  |  | |  | if (0 > (maxLength -= count + 1)) return 0; | |  |  | |  | memset(out, \*reinterpret\_cast<const char \*>(in), count + 1); | |  | out += count + 1; | |  |  | |  | in++; | |  | } | |  | } |      It's better to check the buffer boundary before calling `memset`, just like [#117](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr/pull/117). |
