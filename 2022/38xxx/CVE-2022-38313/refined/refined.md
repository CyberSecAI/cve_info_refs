- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `saveParentControlInfo` function copies the value of the `time` parameter to a stack buffer without checking the size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the attacker-controlled `time` parameter into a fixed-size stack buffer without any bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow if the size of the `time` parameter exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the vulnerable device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint. The `time` parameter is the attack vector, which carries the overflow data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, typically on the local network or if the device is exposed. The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the parameter that triggers the vulnerability.
