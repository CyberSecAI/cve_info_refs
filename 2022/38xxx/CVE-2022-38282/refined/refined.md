The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities found in JFinal CMS 5.1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-controlled input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, and potentially gain control over the underlying database server.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities are present in several administrative backend routes. Specifically, the issue mentions the following vulnerable routes:
   - `admin/videoalbum/list`
   - `admin/video/list`
   - `system/department/list`
   - `system/menu/list`
   - `system/role/list`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to have administrative login credentials. The default credentials of `admin:admin123` are mentioned, which exacerbates the issue.
   - The attacker can then access the backend routes listed and inject SQL payloads through vulnerable parameters.
