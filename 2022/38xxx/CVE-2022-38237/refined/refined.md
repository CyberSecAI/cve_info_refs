- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `DCTStream::readScan()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code attempts to read data past the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The heap buffer overflow can lead to crashes, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted PDF file, as provided in the attached zip file `8id103_heap_buffer_overflow_in_readScan.zip`, can trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `pdftops` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to provide a malicious PDF file to the vulnerable `pdftops` application.
