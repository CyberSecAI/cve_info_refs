- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (a user must open a specially crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to prepare a malicious file that triggers the overflow, and a user must open that file. The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
