This backup plugin simply works – single install, multisite (complete or sub-site backups), without problems. Even on installs where commercial products had difficulties, “Backups Scheduler” kept working. Thank you to the devs!

Finally a plugin that supports the backup of multisites and it works beautifully! Thanks so much for all your work and for providing such a great plugin. You are awesome!

Have quietly relied on Backups Scheduler for years. It has saved the day several times. Work your way through the options, all is there. Never a conflict with theme or other plugin. On rare occasions when I do not receive my morning email assurance that the backup completed, I find it happened to coincide with some other processes maxing out memory on the shared server causing it to hang. Go to dashboard, clear, and initiate a manual backup. (Do not close that backup page or tab until completed.) When I was a new to WP, this plugin developer was very responsive and helpful. Has since incorporated answers to those questions in his documentation. Mature plugin.

Good multi site backup for Free Host Accounts (Hostinger, 000webhost, etc).
But it did not work fully for cloning/migrate the site. The sql backup seems to be incomplete. I needed to do a full export on phpMyAdmin to be able to clone my multisite from Hostinger to openshift. (If developer wants to know the error I am willing to give him feedback)
Needs an option to turn off scheduler or to have only on demand backups. For a blog site this maybe not needed as comments are created continuously, but for a static site there is no need to have schedule backups, since there are not any changes besides occasionally plugins updates and sporadic page changes.

This is great. Now if I have a problem on one site I can restore just that one site. I backs up the upload site folder and does a db backup of just that site number. I set it to email me the backup zip and I then autoforward that to dropbox (to resolve the issues where a failure happened in emailing to dropbox that I didn’t see)
Great

### [Errors Received On Network Activation](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/errors-received-on-network-activation/)

September 3, 2016

Installed under WP 4.3 Multisite installation and attempted Network Activation. Received an error message that said 261 characters of unexpected output were received and suggested deactivating and removing if syndication errors occurred. Couldn’t find network instructions for usage. Deactivated and removed.
