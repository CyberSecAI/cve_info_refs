Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `edit_user.php` file, specifically the `id` parameter. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically a union-based SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database. As demonstrated in the provided example, the database name can be obtained using `database()`. An attacker could also potentially retrieve other data from the database tables using similar techniques.
*   **Data Manipulation/Modification:** With a successful SQL injection attack, an attacker could potentially modify, insert, or delete data within the database, potentially leading to further security compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/cman/admin/edit_user.php` endpoint, with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge on how to construct HTTP GET requests.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.
*   **Authentication (Potentially):** The vulnerability is in the `/cman/admin` directory, so access to the admin page could be required before the vulnerability can be exploited, although this is not explicitly stated. The provided login account `admin/admin` hints that the admin page has a simple or default credential

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/cman/admin/edit_user.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id` parameter in the GET request.
*   **Payload Example:** `/cman/admin/edit_user.php?id=-1' union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6--+`
