Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter within the `/activity/admin/modules/autonumber/index.php` script. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or escape user-supplied input before incorporating it into a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, as demonstrated in the provided example which leaks the database name (`db_wvsu`).
*   **Potential for Full Database Compromise:** Depending on database privileges and application logic, successful SQL injection can lead to complete database compromise, allowing for data modification, deletion, or even gaining shell access to the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL: `/activity/admin/modules/autonumber/index.php`, specifically manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`id`) and the vulnerable endpoint `/activity/admin/modules/autonumber/index.php`
*   **Basic SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to construct malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The provided exploit does not mention the need for prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided payload `id=-1' union select 1,database(),3,4,5--+` demonstrates a successful SQL injection. This payload uses `UNION SELECT` to inject a new row into the result set, displaying the database name.

**Additional Information:**

*   The application is identified as "School Activity Updates with SMS Notification v1.0" by janobe.
*   It is hosted on a sourcecodester.com.
*   It was built using XAMPP-PHP 5.6.
*   The default admin credentials are `admin/admin`.
