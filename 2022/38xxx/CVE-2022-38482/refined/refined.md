    "CVE": "CVE-2022-38482",
    "Root cause": "The application embeds user input into the path or domain of URLs that appear within application responses.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Link manipulation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can construct a link that, if visited by another application user, will modify the target of URLs within the response.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious link and tricking another user into visiting it.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No special privileges are required, but the attacker must be able to craft the malicious link and have another user interact with it."
  },
  {
    "CVE": "CVE-2022-37028",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers, allowing for actions on behalf of users and data exfiltration.",
    "Attack vectors": "Through a specific page and field within the application.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires a low-privileged user account to perform the attack."

    "CVE": "CVE-2022-38481",

    "Weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
        "Impact": "An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the context of another user's browser, potentially performing actions on their behalf and stealing data.",
        "Attack vectors": "Through several vulnerable features within the application.",
            "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No special privileges are needed, but the attacker needs to craft a malicious link that a user will click."
