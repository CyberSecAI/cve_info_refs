- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetFixTools` function within the `/bin/httpd` binary of the Tenda M3 router firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `formSetFixTools` function allocates a heap buffer of 0x28C bytes using `malloc`. It then copies the value of the `hostname` POST parameter into this buffer using `strncpy`. The length of the hostname parameter is not properly checked, allowing an attacker to provide a hostname string larger than the allocated buffer which leads to heap overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The heap overflow can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the `httpd` process. It may potentially be leveraged for more severe impacts, like arbitrary code execution, but the provided information focuses on a DoS attack.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/setFixTools` URL with a specially crafted `hostname` parameter that exceeds the allocated buffer size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the affected device. Access to the device's web interface is needed, requiring authentication, but this requirement was bypassed by patching the `R7WebsSecurityHandler` function, implying that only local access to the device is needed for the exploit to work.
