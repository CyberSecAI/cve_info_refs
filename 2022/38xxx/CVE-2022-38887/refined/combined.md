### **[di1l0o](/di1l0o)** commented [Aug 27, 2022](#issue-1352965984)

| We discovered a potential code execution backdoor in version 0.1.0 of the project, the backdoor is the democritus-strings package. Attackers can upload democritus-strings packages containing arbitrary malicious code. For the safety of this project, the democritus-strings package has been uploaded by us.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58363074/187018927-bf7a1ccb-b447-41b0-be5c-b90c62349b22.png)  The democritus-strings package can be successfully installed using `pip install d8s-python==0.1.0`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58363074/187018998-02fe646f-1615-4224-b5de-3d3b687541de.png)  Suggestion: remove version 0.1.0 of this project in PyPI |
