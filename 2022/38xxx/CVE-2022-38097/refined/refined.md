- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Reader when handling events of form elements (text fields, buttons, etc.). Specifically, annotation objects are prematurely destroyed, and then reused leading to a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (CWE-416).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution can be achieved by exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability.  An attacker can manipulate the memory layout to gain control of the program execution flow.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Opening a specially crafted malicious PDF document.
    - Visiting a malicious website with a specially crafted page if the browser plugin extension is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious site with a crafted page.
