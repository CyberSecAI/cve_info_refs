Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formEmailTest` function within the `httpd` binary of the Tenda M3 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formEmailTest` function allocates a heap buffer of fixed size (0x28C bytes).
- It copies the POST parameter `mailpwd` into this buffer using `memcpy`.
- The size of the `mailpwd` parameter is not validated before copying, which leads to a heap buffer overflow if the length of `mailpwd` exceeds 0x28C.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- Overwriting the heap can cause the program to crash when trying to `malloc`.
- Potentially could be used to achieve remote code execution (RCE), although this is not explicitly shown in the PoC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/testEmail` endpoint.
- The `mailpwd` parameter within the POST data needs to have a length greater than 0x28C bytes.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the target endpoint and parameter name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target device.
- It appears that authentication is required since the provided example includes a cookie, however the page also states "The `R7WebsSecurityHandler` function is used for permission control, and I've modified it to access URLs that can only be accessed after login", so it is unclear how the exploit was made to work without credentials, or if the authentication bypass is part of the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable endpoint `/goform/testEmail`.
- The attacker needs to know the specific POST parameter `mailpwd`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including the specific function (`formEmailTest`), the vulnerable parameter (`mailpwd`), and the exact size of the buffer (0x28C).
- The provided PoC code, including the `requests` python script, clearly shows how to trigger the crash, which is a DoS.
- The content also mentions patching the binary using `qemu-arm-static` to make it easier to test the vulnerability.
