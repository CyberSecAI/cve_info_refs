The provided content relates to a reported vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A global buffer overflow occurs in the `Lexer::getObj` function when parsing a crafted PDF file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow, specifically triggered when reading an object within the Lexer. The overflow occurs while reading past the boundary of the global variable `specialChars`.

**Impact of exploitation:** The crash detail shows the program crashing with an AddressSanitizer error. This could lead to denial of service, and potentially other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted PDF file to the `pdftops` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file, this could be achieved through a website, email attachment, or any other means that would allow the user to process the file with the vulnerable software.
