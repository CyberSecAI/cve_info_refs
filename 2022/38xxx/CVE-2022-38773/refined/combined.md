SSA-482757: Missing Immutable Root of Trust in S7-1500 CPU
devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 4.6

SUMMARY

Affected models of the S7-1500 CPU product family do not contain an Immutable Root of Trust in
Hardware. With this the integrity of the code executed on the device can not be validated during load-time.
An attacker with physical access to the device could use this to replace the boot image of the device and
execute arbitrary code.

As exploiting this vulnerability requires physical tampering with the product, Siemens recommends to
assess the risk of physical access to the device in the target deployment and to implement measures to
make sure that only trusted personnel have access to the physical hardware.

The vulnerability is related to the hardware of the product. Siemens has released new hardware versions
for several CPU types of the S7-1500 product family in which this vulnerability is fixed and is working on
new hardware versions for remaining PLC types to address this vulnerability completely. See the chapter
“Additional Information” below for more details.

For more information please also refer to the related product support article: https://support.industry.
siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109816536/.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict physical access to affected devices to trusted personnel to avoid hardware tampering (e.g.,

place the devices in locked control cabinets)

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining
the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

The SIMATIC S7-1500 MFP CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs with the possibility
to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms implemented in
C/C++ and an additional second independent runtime environment to execute C/C++ applications parallel
to the STEP 7 program if required.

SIMATIC S7-1500 ODK CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs but additionally provide
the possibility to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms
implemented in C/C++. They have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-38773

Affected devices do not contain an Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware. With this the integrity of the
code executed on the device can not be validated during load-time. An attacker with physical access to
the device could use this to replace the boot image of the device and execute arbitrary code.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-482757: Missing Immutable Root of Trust in S7-1500 CPU devices

| Publication Date: | 2023-01-10 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2025-01-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.5 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 4.6 |

SUMMARY

Affected models of the S7-1500 CPU product family do not contain an Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware. With this the integrity of the code executed on the device can not be validated during load-time. An attacker with physical access to the device could use this to replace the boot image of the device and execute arbitrary code.

As exploiting this vulnerability requires physical tampering with the product, Siemens recommends to assess the risk of physical access to the device in the target deployment and to implement measures to make sure that only trusted personnel have access to the physical hardware.

The vulnerability is related to the hardware of the product. Siemens has released new hardware versions for several CPU types of the S7-1500 product family in which this vulnerability is fixed and is working on new hardware versions for remaining PLC types to address this vulnerability completely. See the chapter "Additional Information" below for more details.

For more information please also refer to the related product support article: <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109816536/>.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Restrict physical access to affected devices to trusted personnel to avoid hardware tampering (e.g., place the devices in locked control cabinets)

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

The SIMATIC S7-1500 MFP CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs with the possibility to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms implemented in C/C++ and an additional second independent runtime environment to execute C/C++ applications parallel to the STEP 7 program if required.

SIMATIC S7-1500 ODK CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs but additionally provide the possibility to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms implemented in C/C++. They have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-38773

Affected devices do not contain an Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware. With this the integrity of the code executed on the device can not be validated during load-time. An attacker with physical access to the device could use this to replace the boot image of the device and execute arbitrary code.
