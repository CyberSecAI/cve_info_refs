- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected Siemens S7-1500 CPU devices lack an immutable root of trust in hardware. This prevents the device from validating the integrity of the code during load time.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware (CWE-1326).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access can replace the boot image of the device, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable devices to replace the boot image.
