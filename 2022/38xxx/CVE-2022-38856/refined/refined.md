- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `mov_build_index()` function within `libmpdemux/demux_mov.c`. This overflow is triggered during the processing of a malformed MOV file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow. The `mov_build_index()` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a crash (as shown by the ASAN report, which leads to `ABORTING`) or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution depending on how the memory is manipulated.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted MOV file using `mplayer`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious MOV file to be opened by `mplayer` or `mencoder`.
