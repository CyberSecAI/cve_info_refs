  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-38148",
    "description": "Gridfield state is vulnerable to SQL injections. The vast majority of Gridfields in Silverstripe CMS are affected by this vulnerability. An attacker with CMS access could execute an arbitrary SQL statement by adding an SQL payload in some parts of the GridField state.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user-controlled input within the GridField state, which is used in SQL queries.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Blind SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with CMS access could execute arbitrary SQL statements, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker with CMS access can inject SQL payloads into the GridField state, which is used by the application when constructing database queries."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have CMS access with the ability to interact with GridFields.",
    "additional_information": "Most projects should be able to apply the patch without further work. There's no legitimate use case for this behaviour. Regression testing should focus on custom filtering and sorting logic for Gridfields."
