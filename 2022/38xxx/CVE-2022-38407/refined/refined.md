- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read. This allows an attacker to read memory outside of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (opening a malicious file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the victim to open a specially crafted file. No special privileges or network access is needed.
