Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or parameterize input, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple administrative routes. The vulnerability is triggered by passing unsanitized user-controlled parameters directly into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
    *   Data leakage by extracting sensitive information from the database.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Potentially, complete control over the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges.
*   **Application compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the database user, the attacker may be able to leverage the compromised database to further compromise the application or the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are passed through HTTP requests within the administrative interface, which appear to be URL parameters.
*   **Specific routes:**
    *   `admin/videoalbum/list`
    *   `admin/video/list`
    *   `system/department/list`
    *   `system/menu/list`
    *   `system/role/list`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have administrator login credentials to access the vulnerable routes. The content mentions that the default admin account credentials are `admin:admin123`, which could be exploited if not changed.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's web interface.

**Additional Details:**
* The content provides specific vulnerable routes and image proofs of successful SQL injection at the described routes.
