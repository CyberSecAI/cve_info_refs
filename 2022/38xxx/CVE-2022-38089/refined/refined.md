Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-38089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Exment product by Kajitori Co.,Ltd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The application stores malicious script within its database, and when this data is retrieved and displayed to users it will execute the script in their browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on the web browser of users accessing the website.
- The vulnerability may lead to the theft of sensitive information (e.g., session cookies), defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts through some data input mechanism within the application.
- The injected script will be stored on the server and executed when other users access the affected area, leading to exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have "low privileges" or an account with sufficient rights to post to the database where malicious content will be stored.
- The attacker's malicious data must be stored by the application.
- The attacker does not require user interaction with a link (the malicious script is stored). The vulnerability is triggered when the data is viewed by other users.
