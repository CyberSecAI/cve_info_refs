The provided content relates to CVE-2022-38495.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `macho_reader.c`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `print_binary` function of `macho_reader.c`, triggered when parsing a malformed Mach-O binary. The vulnerability occurs due to an out-of-bounds read in the `LIEF::MachO::init_c_commands` function, during the processing of load commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the application
- Potential for more serious consequences such as code execution, though the provided report only shows a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting the vulnerability requires a specially crafted Mach-O binary file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `macho_reader` tool attempts to parse this crafted binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious Mach-O file to the `macho_reader` tool.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have any existing privileges on the system.
