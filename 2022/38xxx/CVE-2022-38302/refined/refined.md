Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `manage_department.php` script. Specifically, the `id` parameter passed via the GET request is directly used in a SQL query without validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, personal details, and other application data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Database Takeover:** In some scenarios, the attacker could potentially gain full control of the database server depending on database configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects SQL code through the `id` parameter in a GET request to `manage_department.php`. The vulnerable URL is:
    `/leave_system/admin/maintenance/manage_department.php?id=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs a working knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
*   **Targeted web application access:** The attacker must be able to reach the login page and obtain valid admin credentials.

**Additional Details**

* The provided content includes a sample payload: `/leave_system/admin/maintenance/manage_department.php?id=1%27%20and%20length(database())%20=9--+`. This payload is used to demonstrate how to determine the length of the database name.
* The document provides two screenshots that show the behavior of the exploit: when the length is incorrect (length=8), the page appears as normal, while when the length is correct (length=9), the page output changes, confirming the vulnerability.
