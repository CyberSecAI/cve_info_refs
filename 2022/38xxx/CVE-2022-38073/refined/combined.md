  Free Woocommerce Integration: Adds the SUBMIT TICKET and MY TICKET page links to the WooCommerce user dashboard

## Blocks

This plugin provides 2 blocks.

* My Tickets
* Submit Ticket

## Installation

#### Using The WordPress Dashboard

1. Navigate to the ‘Add New’ in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for ‘Awesome Support’
3. Click ‘Install Now’
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

#### Uploading in WordPress Dashboard

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Navigate to the ‘Add New’ in the plugins dashboard
3. Navigate to the ‘Upload’ area
4. Select `awesome-support.zip` from your computer
5. Click ‘Install Now’
6. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

#### Using FTP

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Extract the `awesome-support` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `awesome-support` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

#### Setup

Whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, the setup is done silently in the background.

Two new pages will be added to your site:

* My Tickets
* Submit ticket

Add those two pages to your menu in order to give your users easy access to their support area.

## FAQ

### I’ve installed the plugin – now what?

Now you can [read our post installation instructions](https://getawesomesupport.com/documentation/awesome-support/post-installation-need-know-quick-start/) or [watch the installation videos](https://getawesomesupport.com/videos/)

### Weird or scrambled UI in wp-admin on the ticket screen after upgrading to 5.0

This can happen because old JS and CSS files are cached in your browser. On most browsers you can use the CTRL-F5 key on any Awesome Support page to force a full refresh.

### Missing tabs or menu options after upgrading from version 3.x to 5.x

This happens because new WordPress custom security capabilities were introduced in version 4.0.0 of Awesome Support. [Read this FAQ on our site to learn how adjust your system for these new security items.](https://getawesomesupport.com/question/missing-tabs-menu-options-version-4-0-upgrade/)

### I get a blank page after ticket submission

This is most likely a permalinks issue. What you need to do is log into your WordPress admin, go to *Settings > Permalinks* and hit the *Save* button. You don’t actually need to change anything, just hitting *Save* will refresh your permalinks structure, including the new `ticket` post type.

### The plugin data isn’t removed from the database after uninstall

If you want to delete the plugin and all of its data, you need to go to the *Advanced* tab in the plugin settings and check the *Delete Data* option. Only then the data will be removed from the database during the uninstall process.

### Users get “You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket”

Normally, when a user registers through the plugin, he/she is given the role *Support User*. [This role has special capabilities](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities).

If your users get the error message *“You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket”*, it means that they don’t have the special capabilities. This can happen when you install into an existing site and your users already have a role assigned.

Here you have two choices:

1. Change all your users’ role to *Support User*
2. Give the role you want to use (eg. *Subscriber*) the special capabilities

If you don’t know how to add new capabilities to a role, we suggest you use a plugin like [User Role Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) and give the desired role the following capabilities:

* `view_ticket`
* `create_ticket`
* `close_ticket`
* `reply_ticket`
* `attach_files`

**Do not give your users more than those 5 capabilities**, otherwise they could get administrative privileges.

### How to disable agent auto-assignment

If you need to disable the auto-assignment function and hence have all new tickets assigned to the default agent (set in the plugin general settings), you can add this constant in your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```
define( 'WPAS_DISABLE_AUTO_ASSIGN', true );

```

### How to set the product field as mandatory?

If you have enabled multi-products support and want to make the “Product” field in the submission form mandatory, just add the following code snippet to your theme’s `functions.php` file: https://gist.github.com/julien731/a519956ce9c81542439c. Alternatively, if you don’t want to mess with code you can pick up our POWERPACK add-on where you can tick a box to turn this feature on.

### How to change the tickets slug?

By default, all tickets will be accessed through a URL of the type domain.com/ticket/my-ticket-title.

If you wish to change the slug `ticket` to something else, let’s say `help`, so that your URLs look like domain.com/help/my-ticket-title, you need to add a constant in your theme’s `functions.php` file as follows:

```
define( 'WPAS_SLUG', 'my_new_slug' );

```

### I don’t receive e-mail notifications

There are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. Please read this article for details: https://getawesomesupport.com/email-notifications-awesome-support-wordpress/

The support for this product is very frustrating. Moreover, asking for a refund is very difficult.

An excellent plugin with technical support requests for Wordpress. The free version has quite a lot of functionality. Thank you very much to the developers!

### [Be wary of the free version](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/an-awesome-helpdesk-tickets-plugin/)

[kira7](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kira7/ "Posts by kira7")

Originally gave a 5-star review but now upon having a serious, unresolved issue, I can no longer recommend the free plugin. The plugin caused a critical error on a main category on our site – and given no support via Awesome Support email nor via WP Forums, I have had to find an another ticketing/helpdesk option. The free version of the plugin literally caused our main product category, to become a “critical error” page instead of showing the range of products in that category. As soon as plugin turned off, category worked as normal. My concern would be this occurring on a larger site than ours (we have only 3 categories so saw this issue easily). If this happened on a larger site you may never notice unless you went through thorough testing into every category and sub-category to check. And we could turn off the plugin, then category worked as normal, turn back on plugin, category kept working, but as soon as you did anything with a ticket, the issue returned to that one specific category in it becoming a “critical error” page. I also disabled every setting under the Settings > Product Management section so as to not have syncing of our product range with the plugin, but that didn’t help either.
One other issue with the free version I found was that when a customer put up a post in a helpdesk ticket, upon submitting it and page refresh their comment wasn’t appearing for them to see in the ticket. Again, bit of an issue given they really need to be able to see what they just posted. After logging out and back the comment was seen.
I cannot comment on the paid-for version as only tested the free version.
Such a shame as the ticketing system itself, the interface, functionality etc was so good – but just not functional for us with the 2 above-mentioned issues.

two times i tried the update and it does nothing but either stop the website from loading which was the first time and had to go to my web host to fix.
Now today i just tried the new update and then i could not load my media library until i deactivated the plugin.
Version 6.1.6 works fine so what happen from this version to your update?
I just know this update has been nothing but issues and trying to build a business the last thing you want is a potential customer not to be able to load your website.
I hope i can stay using Version 6.1.6 but if it going to stop working because they updated I will find another solution.
This plugin should work with any wordpress theme that wordpress offer with ease and if it does not it should be stated.
This update been nothing but issues for months so my final conclusion is i went back to Version 6.1.6 which works fine with no issues if for some reason this version stops then it time to look for another support system.
I gave you 2 stars only because the version i am using works but from a business view it would be a 1 star rating just because time is money and the new update causing the website not to load can cause a customer to go somewhere else which leads to a loss of revenue.
Well Hopefully i can keep this as a support system and change my review but tried the update before and gave it one more go today and same thing.
Your better off going back to Version 6.1.6 since no one had issues with it.
Well will see how this goes……

A disconcerting experience… I bought the plugins only to encounter REST API errors and cron tasks that are blocking my WooCommerce-powered WordPress site… I reached out to the support team, who nonchalantly informed me that these issues would be resolved in an upcoming update… An update that, even after one month, has yet to materialize. In short, I strongly advise you to steer clear of this solution as quickly as possible (the number of updates and the delay would alarm you). Consider alternatives like Fluent Support.

  + The flag that controls whether the end user can set the auto-delete-attachment checkbox was not being respected when replying to tickets – but only doing so when the overall auto-delete-attachment flag was turned off.
  + Removed a header from the general settings tab that was unnecessary (no child items existed for it).

  + Added option to load earlier versions of select2
  + Cleaned up logic related to messages shown when ticket failed to close properly on the back-end.
  + Cleaned up logic related to messages shown when ticket failed to close properly on the front-end.
  + Overlays: Made styling for input and select buttons for certain overlays specific to the Ticket-list page instead of overriding all the other ticket pages.
  + Renamed certain sections of the TICKETS->SETTING->EMAILS tab and added descriptive text to certain other items.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
