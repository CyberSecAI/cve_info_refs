- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing a crafted URL to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create a crafted link. When a victim clicks the link, it could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a victim and convince the victim to click the URL.
