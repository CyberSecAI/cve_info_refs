Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-38890.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds (OOB) read in the `njs_utf8_next` function within the njs library. This function is responsible for iterating through UTF-8 encoded strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The `njs_utf8_next` function attempts to access memory beyond the bounds of a string, leading to a segmentation fault (SEGV).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The out-of-bounds read results in a crash of the njs process due to a segmentation fault. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition for applications relying on the njs library.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript input: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing specially crafted JavaScript code to the njs engine that manipulates strings in a way that causes an out-of-bounds read in `njs_utf8_next`. The provided PoC demonstrates this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code: An attacker must be able to execute JavaScript code that is processed by the vulnerable njs library. This could occur if an attacker can control the input to an application using the library.
- No special privileges needed: The vulnerability is triggered through normal program execution of the provided javascript code.
