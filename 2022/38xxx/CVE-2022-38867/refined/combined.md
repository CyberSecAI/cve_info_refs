| Summary SQL injection occurs on the server side of rtty: `rttys`.  **Affected Version: v4.0.0<= rttys <= v4.0.2** **Attacker could register a malformed account in server side, logged in and trigger the SQL injection.**  I tried to contact to you using huntr platform, but it seems not work, so I post the security issue here. Analysis The `sink point` occurs on the `/devs` api route:  ``` //api.go authorized.GET("/devs", func(c *gin.Context) { 		type DeviceInfo struct { 			ID          string `json:"id"` 			Connected   uint32 `json:"connected"` 			Uptime      uint32 `json:"uptime"` 			Description string `json:"description"` 			Bound       bool   `json:"bound"` 			Online      bool   `json:"online"` 		}  		db, err := instanceDB(cfg.DB) 		if err != nil { 			log.Error().Msg(err.Error()) 			c.Status(http.StatusInternalServerError) 			return 		} 		defer db.Close()  		sql := "SELECT id, description, username FROM device"  		if cfg.LocalAuth || !isLocalRequest(c) { 			username := getLoginUsername(c) 			if username == "" { 				c.Status(http.StatusUnauthorized) 				return 			}  			if !isAdminUsername(cfg, username) { 				sql += fmt.Sprintf(" WHERE username = '%s'", username) 			} 		}  ```  At the end of the above code snippet, `sql += fmt.Sprintf(" WHERE username = '%s'", username)`, `'%s'` shows that `username` is delivered to SQL statement without sanitized. If we could control `username` variable，then SQL injection could be exploited. Coincidentally there is no sanitization of `username` when attacker register malformed account.  The `source point` occurs on `username` at `/signup` api route.  Meanwhile, `if !isAdminUsername(cfg, username){` shows that only general username could trigger the SQL injection, that is good for attack. Proof of Concept 1.Create a docker environment locally, using the docker command recommended. `sudo docker run -it -p 5912:5912 -p 5913:5913 zhaojh329/rttys:latest`  2.Access the Web panel opened in <http://ip:5913/>, click `Sign up` to register new user. Because it is a docker demo, we have to register a `admin` account firstly.  3.After registered `admin` username, then attacker register a new malformed username `xyz' union select username,password,3 from account--` with any password like `SecurityTest`  4.Attacker logged in with username `xyz' union select username,password,3 from account--`successfully, we could find that the **password of admin and other users** is showing, which is the result of exploit of SQL injection. As is showing below  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20917372/186354230-2dbb0152-6e15-4101-9797-140c9605fb61.png) |
