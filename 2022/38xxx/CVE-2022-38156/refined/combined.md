SpectralNet Narrowband
RF Anywhere . . . Over Any
IP Network

The  need  to  collocate  antennas  and  their  RF  signal
processing  equipment  has  limited  ground  networks  from
evolving  to  the  latest  high-efficiency  architectures  and
technologies. SpectralNet digitizers remove that limitation
with their ability to transport digitized RF as IP packets over
any network to any location and recreate the RF signals if
necessary.

OpenSpace  SpectralNet  is  a  carrier  grade  digitizer  that
brings analog RF data to the IP network world, unleashing
the  power  of  virtualization  and  centralization  of  ground
architectures  for  satellite  and  ranging  ground  systems,
teleports, UAV and missile ranges and ISR data processing.

SpectralNet  narrowband  models  digitize  up  to  54  MHz
of  RF  spectrum  in  real-time,  converts  the  RF  signals  into
network-ready IP packets using the VITA 49 standard and
transports the data in an assured manner over private and
public IP networks.

Advantages of SpectralNet

•  Digitized data transmission over a standard WAN
  without any distance limitations
•  Network performance optimization for distributed

transport with multi-cast capabilities

•  Operational efficiency with a reduced infrastructure
footprint and less expertise needed at antenna sites

•  Enable transmission of IP streams over impaired IP
  network links
•  Automate critical system redundancy and resilience
  with a 1:1 failover option
•  Configurable time deterministic latency to account for
  network latency and jitter

SpectralNet  digitizers  are  a  key  component  of  the
satellite  ground  system’s  digital  on  ramp  to  the  next-gen

SpectralNet Narrowband displays the RF stream it has received for
transport and/or the transmitted RF stream it has regenerated from
the transport.

Enable the Digital On-Ramp to the
Virtual Ground Station

•  Transform the ground network from analog to digital
•  Provide reliable IP transport using standards-based
  VITA-49 protocol
•  Scale cost effectively by processing signals in the
  cloud and/or virtual environments
•  Minimize space and power requirements across the
  ground network

transformation  in  delivering  data  to  the  virtual  ground
station.  Kratos’  OpenSpace  platform  is  the  industry's  only
fully managed, virtual and software-defined satellite ground
system.  The  platform  includes  Virtual  Network  Functions
(VNF)  for  signal  processing  in  the  cloud  or  on  premise.
SpectralNet  reliably  delivers  data  to  any  destination  –  on
premise, to the cloud, or to OpenSpace.
