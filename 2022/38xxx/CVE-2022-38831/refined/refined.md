The provided content relates to CVE-2022-38831.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `httpd/SetNetControlList` function of the Tenda RX9 Pro router.
- The `SetNetControlList` function receives a list of values from an HTTP POST request.
- The function then passes these values to `sub_43157C` without checking the length of the input, leading to a buffer overflow when `strcpy` is used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `SetNetControlList` function.
- Lack of input validation or length checks before copying the data using `strcpy`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
- Attackers can potentially gain control over the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `http://<router-ip>/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint.
- The request should contain a long string in the `list` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router.
- No authentication required as the vulnerable function is accessible without credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function is located in the `httpd` service.
- The overflow occurs in the call to `strcpy` inside the `sub_43157C` function.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability using a string of 300 'A' characters sent as the `list` parameter.
- The affected version is Tenda RX9 Pro firmware version V22.03.02.10.
