{
  "CVE-2022-38129": {
    "root_cause": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the com.keysight.tentacle.licensing.LicenseManager.addLicenseFile() method.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The method checks for Windows file separators but can be bypassed using forward slashes (../).",
      "The sensorPing() method does not use absolute paths when calling ping.exe, making it possible to execute arbitrary files."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can upload arbitrary files to the SMS host and achieve unauthenticated RCE.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker can remotely invoke the addLicenseFile() method via URL endpoint /server/service/licensingServiceHttpInvoker.",
      "Path traversal in the license filename can be used to upload an attacker-controlled file to any location on the SMS host.",
        "com.keysight.tentacle.config.SensorConfigurer.sensorPing() (via /server/service/sensorConfigServiceHttpInvoker) can be used to execute an uploaded payload."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability."
