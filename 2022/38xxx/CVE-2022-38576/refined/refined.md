Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `delete.php` file of the Interview Management System v1.0. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the URL `delete.php?action=deletecand&id=` is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input received via the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi). The application directly uses the user-supplied `id` parameter in the SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Leakage:** As demonstrated by the provided payload, an attacker can use SQLi to extract sensitive information from the database. In this specific example, the `database()` function is used to leak the name of the database being used by the application. An attacker can use SQL injection to extract any data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `delete.php` file, including the SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter within the URL is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable file `/interview/delete.php` and the parameter `id`.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to construct the malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a specific example payload to extract the database name: `/interview/delete.php?action=deletecand&id=(updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20database()),0x7e),0))`.
- It is mentioned that the application was built using XAMPP with PHP 8.1.
- The login credentials for the system are also provided, which allows for access to the vulnerable functionality.

This information provides detailed insight into the SQL injection vulnerability, its location, the method of exploitation, and the potential impact of a successful attack, going beyond a simple description.
