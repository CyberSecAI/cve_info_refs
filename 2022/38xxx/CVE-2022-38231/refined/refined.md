The provided content is related to CVE-2022-38231.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `DCTStream::getChar()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: Reading memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash, as reported by AddressSanitizer.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution depending on the specifics of the overflow and the platform.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting a crafted PDF file, which when processed by `pdftops` triggers the heap buffer overflow in `DCTStream::getChar()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious PDF file to be processed by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must have the capability to trigger the processing of the malicious PDF file, likely by invoking `pdftops`.

**Additional Details**
- The crash occurs in `DCTStream::getChar()` at `Stream.cc:2302:9` when reading 4 bytes at memory location `0x7f54608ff800`.
- The overflow occurs when reading past the 131072-byte region allocated by `malloc` at `[0x7f54608df800,0x7f54608ff800)`.
- The specific commit where the vulnerability was introduced is `ffaf11c`.
- The provided crash sample is `8id93_heap_buffer_overflow_in_getChar.zip`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by running: `./pdftops -q [crash sample] /dev/null`.
