### **[ce-automne](/ce-automne)** commented [Aug 26, 2022](#issue-1352067037)

| Summary `api/v1/protocol/set` and `api/v1/images/set` API endpoints are vulnerable to authenticated SQL injection.  **Affected version:** ehoney v2.0.0 Analysis **1.** For `api/v1/protocol/set`, the sink point occurs on the **models/protocol.go**  ``` //models/protocol.go  var p = "%" + payload.Payload + "%" sql := fmt.Sprintf("select id, creator, status, create_time, protocol_type, deploy_path, default_flag, min_port, max_port from protocols where CONCAT(id, creator, create_time, protocol_type, deploy_path, min_port, max_port) LIKE '%s' order by create_time DESC", p)  ```  **2.** For `api/v1/images/set`, the sink point occurs on the **models/images.go**  ``` //models/images.go  var p = "%" + payload.Payload + "%" sql := fmt.Sprintf("select id, image_name, image_address, image_port, image_type, default_flag from images where CONCAT(image_name, image_address, image_port, image_type) LIKE '%s'", p)  ```  As you can see on the above code snippets, `payload.Payload` is delivered to SQL statement without sanitized, and `payload.Payload` could be user-controlled, source point lies on **Payload parameter** in these two api endpoint, then SQL injection arises. Proof of Concept Take Ehoney's [demo environment](http://47.98.206.178:8080/decept-defense) as example, and use `api/v1/protocol/set` endpoint to prove the SQL injection, `api/v1/images/set` is similar.  After attacker logged in with `admin/admin123`, he could intercept the requests and inject into malicious payload to achieve SQL injection. **Payload:** `TOM' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(CONCAT('***',database()),'***'),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- a`  As is showing below, attacker uses BurpSuite to perform attack, the server respond to us with database name: **sec\_ehoneypot**  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20917372/186881198-6dc6855f-8c85-449e-8972-937826b1fa99.png) |
