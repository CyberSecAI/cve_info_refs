The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Ehoney application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input (`payload.Payload`) before it is used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `api/v1/protocol/set` and `api/v1/images/set` endpoints are affected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input being directly included in SQL queries
- Use of `LIKE` operator with user-controlled input, which makes the injection easier

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- In the provided example, the attacker was able to extract the database name (`sec_ehoneypot`).
- Full control of the database is possible, allowing for data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `api/v1/protocol/set` and `api/v1/images/set` API endpoints.
- The `Payload` parameter within the request body can be manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with valid user credentials (e.g., admin/admin123).
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).
- No special network position is required beyond access to the application's API.
