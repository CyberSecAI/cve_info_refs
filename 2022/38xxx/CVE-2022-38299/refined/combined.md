## Description

This PR fixes an issue where a potentially malicious user can connect to disallowed hosts from the Elasticsearch plugin within Appsmith. This is because Elasticsearch client SDK is a HTTP interface underneath the hood.

## Type of change

* Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)

## How Has This Been Tested?

* Junits for the following:
  + create datasource with disallowed host
  + validate datasource with disallowed host
  + test datasource with disallowed host

## Checklist:

* My code follows the style guidelines of this project
* I have performed a self-review of my own code
* I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
* I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
* My changes generate no new warnings
* I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
* New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Approving this with a note that disallowed hosts should be at a common place instead of a per-plugin level. Request you to raise an issue for this so that this doesn't get missed. Thanks! |
