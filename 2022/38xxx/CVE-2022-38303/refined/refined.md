Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `/leave_system/admin/employees/manage_leave_type.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection. The application directly uses the `id` parameter from the URL in a SQL query without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially read sensitive data (in this case, they are able to determine the database name and its length via the `length(database())` function). 
- By further exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to:
    -  Retrieve other data from the database, including user credentials or sensitive application data.
    -  Modify database records.
    -  Potentially gain unauthorized access to the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack is performed by manipulating the `id` parameter in a GET request to the vulnerable URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- No prior authentication is required to trigger this specific SQL injection, although the user needs to have access to the page.
