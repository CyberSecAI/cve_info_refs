Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the cleartext transmission of credentials when accessing the Netgear Orbi router's web interface via HTTP. Although the router has an option to "Always use HTTPS," the initial authentication request is sent over HTTP before being redirected to HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of credentials during the initial HTTP authentication attempt.
- Lack of enforcement of HTTPS for the initial login request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of sensitive information: An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can intercept the cleartext credentials transmitted over HTTP.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: An attacker positioned on the same network as the victim can intercept the initial HTTP request containing the user's login credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim (either through the WiFi or an Ethernet connection).
- The attacker needs to be capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept network traffic.
- The attacker does not need prior knowledge of the password, but has to obtain it via MitM.

- Netgear Orbi Router RBR750 (firmware version 4.6.8.5 and below)
