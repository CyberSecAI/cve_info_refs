The provided content is related to CVE-2022-38142.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, the Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior deserialize user-supplied data provided through the Device-Gateway service port without proper verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could provide malicious serialized objects to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization. This could lead to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send malicious serialized objects to the Device-Gateway service port.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An unauthenticated attacker is required, and they need to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service port. No user interaction is required.
