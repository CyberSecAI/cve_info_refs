### Our attempts to mitigate Power Automate’s limitations by inserting reminders and notifications to the user like, ‘Hey, this instance is about to expire. Do something with it,’ didn’t always work. So, instance failure rate was the metric that we wanted to change. With Nintex, the 20% failure rate we experienced in Power Automate dropped significantly.
