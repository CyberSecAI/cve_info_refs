Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `url` parameter within the `fetch_net_file_upload` function in `includes/baijiacms/common.inc.php`. This function uses `file_get_contents()` to fetch content from a URL provided by the user, without restricting the allowed protocols or performing sufficient checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes requests to arbitrary URLs, controlled by the attacker via the `url` parameter.
- **Lack of URL Validation:** The application fails to validate the provided URL, allowing for schemes like `http://`, as well as `file://`, or potentially others.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Request Execution:** An attacker can force the server to make requests to internal or external resources.
- **Intranet Probing:** The vulnerability can be used to probe internal network services, potentially revealing sensitive information or vulnerabilities.
- **Local File Reading:** Using the `file://` protocol, an attacker can read sensitive files from the server's file system.
- **Possible Information Disclosure:** As the fetched content is saved under an accessible `attachment` folder, attackers can retrieve the file contents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The `url` parameter is passed through a GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid authentication credentials to access the affected functionality.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in `includes/baijiacms/common.inc.php` within the function `fetch_net_file_upload`.
- The vulnerable function is called in `system/public/class/web/file.php`.
- The `url` parameter from the `$_GET` request is passed to `fetch_net_file_upload` function.
- `file_get_contents($url)` is used to fetch the content, without sufficient sanitization or validation of the URL.
- The fetched content is saved to the `attachment` folder, allowing the attacker to access it using the returned filename.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) URLs and curl commands, demonstrating how to exploit the SSRF vulnerability to probe internal services and read local files.
- The vulnerability exists in baijiacms version 4.1.4.
- The PHP version used is 7.x.
