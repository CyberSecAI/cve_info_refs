Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Free5GC webconsole allows access to sensitive information without proper authentication. It uses a default username "admin" as a token in the header, which grants access without requiring a password or any form of verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The webconsole lacks proper authentication mechanisms, relying solely on a default, easily discoverable token.
*   **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to exposure of sensitive data through API endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can gain unauthorized access to:
*   Registered UEs (plmnID, ueId)
*   Subscriber information (AccessType, CmState, Guti, Mcc, Mnc, Dnn, PduSessionId, Sd, SmContextRef, Sst, Supi, Tac)
*   Tenant information
*   User information associated with specific tenants (including email addresses and encrypted passwords)

This information could be used for various malicious purposes, such as tracking users, gaining insights into network infrastructure and operations, and potentially launching further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific API endpoints of the Free5GC webconsole. The attacker sends a request with the default token ("admin") in the header.
Example endpoints include:
* `/api/subscriber`
* `/api/registered-ue-context/{imsi}`
* `/api/tenant`
* `/api/tenant/{tenantId}/user`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the Free5GC webconsole (e.g., by knowing the IP address and port of the web console)
*   The attacker needs to know to use the default token ("admin") in the `Token` header field.

**Additional Information:**
* The issue was reported for free5GC version v3.2.1
* The issue was fixed by addressing it in the webconsole component. The fix was merged as [PR #44](https://github.com/free5gc/webconsole/pull/44) in webconsole repo.
* The report also notes the vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5 and a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
