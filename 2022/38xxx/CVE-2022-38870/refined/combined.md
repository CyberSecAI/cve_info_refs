| I'm not the developer of free5gc, for me, it's a feature 😃 But really who is concerned by this? From my point of view this implementation is not targeting businesses, but engineers that want to test and learn 5G. Keeping it simple and not hiding information makes it better - at least when the part is not standardized. |

| But really who is concerned by this? From my point of view this implementation is not targeting businesses, but engineers that want to test and learn 5G.  I disagree. First because when looking at [the main page](https://www.free5gc.org/), it never says that it is for education purposes only. If it was for education purposes only, there should be a huge warning sign not to use it in production.  And second, I think there are some companies out there who want to use free5gc as a core network in production. The main page explicitly states that the Apache license allows free usage for commercial purposes. This is usually not something that you would need to mention (because the Apache license is included in the repository and is generally a well-known license). I guess the reason it is mentioned is because people asked. And people usually ask this because they at least *think* about using it in production for commercial purposes.  A student at my university did some scans on Shodan and similar sites. She found many exposed free5gc all over the world. I admit it is hard to find out whether these instances are for education / research purpose or for production use, but some of them seem to belong to actual mobile network operators.  Keeping it simple and not hiding information makes it better - at least when the part is not standardized.  Having secure access control would not heavily impact your ability to play around with free5gc. You would just have to add an extra step to handle some kind of security token. and then you could just proceed to do whatever you did before. |
