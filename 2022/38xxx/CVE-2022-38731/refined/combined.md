# Cyber security services

From detection and protection to response and recovery, stay ahead of cyber risk and build the resilience to take on change with confidence. Put cyber security at the heart of how you transform.

[Rethink cyber risk and resilience](#landscape) [Our cyber security services](#services) [How we can help you](#help)

## Rethink cyber risk and resilience

Driven by constant disruption and ever-changing risk, tech-driven transformation is now a perpetual business-as-usual state for organisations instead of a one-time hit. Putting cyber security at the heart of this essential change and reinvention is critical to gaining trust, protecting your organisation’s reputation and building the resilience to protect and create value.

Transformation and cyber security are inextricably linked, whether you’re digitising supply chains, building cloud-based business models or developing responsible and secure ways to innovate with generative AI. Your reliance on technology – its complex interdependencies and the cyber security risk it brings – means the impact of a cyber attack can be rapid and significant.

Keeping your employees and customers safe, and protecting your organisation’s prized information and assets, means staying ahead of cyber security risk, not just responding to it.

Through our deep technical cyber security expertise and breadth of business knowledge, combined with our powerful technology alliances, we help organisations across all industries embrace this change with confidence. From strategy to delivery to incident response and recovery, we can help you stay ahead of cyber security threats to protect value and unlock new opportunities to accelerate growth.

**“As the way we live, work and connect with each other is increasingly digital first, cyber security must be embedded at the heart of everything we do. Only by working together to stay ahead of complex cyber risk can we protect and strengthen the values on which our society is built.”**

## What is DOSE?

DOSE is a dose management solution that automatically monitors, evaluates and reports the radiation dose that patients receive for multi-facility, multi-modality and multi-vendor imaging environments.

The solution provides direct insight into the daily dose management, the clinical image quality and the performance of your department. It assures regulated reports and provides an efficient pro-active solution to the labour-intensive regulatory compliance monitoring. In this way, DOSE assists the users to improve quality and maintain patient safety in medical imaging.

![qaelum dose scanner](/images/solutions/coach/qaelum-dose-scanner.jpg)

## Why DOSE?

The dose management software, DOSE, developed by Qaelum, is one of the most powerful and flexible systems of its kind. Since its commercialisation started around 2012 the software has continuously improved. DOSE is the core product of our company, into which all the know-how and energy of our employees flows! The quality is also reflected in the product classification of a class IIb medical device. To our knowledge, DOSE is the only product of its type on the market that has achieved this high classification. DOSE is the optimal solution for automated quality management in medical imaging.

![qaelum dose docter](/images/solutions/dose/qaelum-dose-docter.jpg)

## Legal Conformity

With DOSE you will always be on the safe side, conforming to local legislation. Special consideration is given to the best possible implementation of national regulations. It is very important to us that the daily work is not burdened by additional tasks, so DOSE informs the users automatically of any adverse events, e.g. via pop-up window or E-mail. Subsequently it’s possible to directly enter predefined or individual reasons or justifications for an event.

DOSE allows you to continuously capture all radiation dose data to evaluate compliance. Our solution works with a ‘traffic light’ system, which informs you on Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs). Whenever the achievable or acceptable regulatory levels are surpassed, the study or series will be flagged orange or red respectively to allow for further investigation.

[![qaelum dose feature legal conformity 1](/images/solutions/dose/legal-conformity-1.jpg)](/images/solutions/dose/legal-conformity-1.jpg)

With DOSE you set up unique combinations and monitor progress intuitively for key factors like peak skin dose, kerma-area product (KAP), air kerma at reference point, … You can set notifications on individual parameters that exceed a pre-set threshold, but also on cumulative parameters within a specific time interval. Whenever the pre-set threshold is exceeded, a notification is generated. This can be accompanied by an email to the person responsible for these events in order that they are notified quickly and can perform the required actions.

DOSE also helps to achieve compliance with the Joint Commission requirements for CT and fluoroscopy.

[![qaelum dose feature legal conformity 3](/images/solutions/dose/legal-conformity-3.jpg)](/images/solutions/dose/legal-conformity-3.jpg)

## Team and Role Management

DOSE has an extensive, but easy to use team and role management system. This allows the operators to use the dose management system effectively, letting them concentrate on their respective core tasks. In addition, user access can be limited to specific data and devices by an administrator.

For example, our concept of live dashboards enables immediate feedback regarding dose and quality. The technician has the possibility to directly comment on the performed exam and justify a potential high dose or decreased image quality. All these comments can be collected inside one report and can be used to personalize additional training per technician. Comments can also be useful to save time when investigating outliers.

[![qaelum dose feature Team and Role Management](/images/solutions/dose/team-and-role-management.jpg)](/images/solutions/dose/team-and-role-management.jpg)

## PACS, HIS and RIS Integration

DOSE works optimally with PACS, HIS and RIS systems via standardized interfaces. With one click in DOSE, the user can jump directly to the complete study in the PACS and vice versa. This considerably simplifies the work of physicians, radiologists and medical physicists. Justifications, comments or dose values can be exchanged automatically and radiation dose passports can be called up across program boundaries. The patient passport contains all registered dose information from this particular patient, including the type and number of studies they have had and the interval between these studies. By doing so, you can easily track the patient’s cumulative dose and imaging history.

[![PACS HIS and RIS Integration](/images/solutions/dose/pacs-his-and-ris-integration---blurred.gif)](/images/solutions/dose/pacs-his-and-ris-integration---blurred.gif)

## Advanced CT Analysis

Even advanced CT analysis becomes child’s play with DOSE. The software extracts all relevant information from available data and calculates advanced parameters such as SSDE. Considering that basic dosimetric parameters like CTDIvol are measured on phantoms, segmenting the actual images to get closer to the patient size allows for a better dosimetric approach. Other parameters that can have a great influence on the patient dose are visualized by means of clearly arranged graphics, for example, the tube current modulation, the patient positioning or the calculation of blind scanning. Blind scanning should be avoided since the CT scanner does not know exactly how to behave or what dose to use in the blind area. This problem is evaluated by DOSE since it calculates blind scanning and displays it on the localizer.

[![Advanced CT Analysis](/images/solutions/dose/advanced-ct-analysis-.png)](/images/solutions/dose/advanced-ct-analysis-.png)

## Image Quality Analysis

An applied radiation dose must always be perceived in relation to the image quality. Therefore, Qaelum is constantly working to include helpful tools to analyze image quality. With the Global Noise Level (GNL) we offer a scientifically described image quality index, which allows a direct evaluation and outlier detection by performing a multiparameter analysis.

[![Image Quality Analysis](/images/solutions/dose/image-quality-analysis.png)](/images/solutions/dose/image-quality-analysis.png)

## Virtual Dose CT and Virtual Dose IR

DOSE calculates effective dose for all ionizing radiation modalities for the standard settings of each examination. For an even more detailed analysis, very powerful tools are optionally available with Virtual Dose CT and Virtual Dose IR. The examination parameters can be adjusted directly and several scenarios can be simulated using different phantoms (from infants to adults, as well as various stages of pregnancy).

[![Virtual Dose CT and Virtual Dose IR](/images/solutions/dose/virtual-dose-ct-and-virtual-dose-ir.png)](/images/solutions/dose/virtual-dose-ct-and-virtual-dose-ir.png)

## Peak Skin Dose

DOSE enables the calculation of Peak Skin Dose from interventional procedures and displays this on a coloured dose map and an elliptical phantom. Based on the peak skin dose values, the system automatically provides information on which deterministic effects can be anticipated and which follow-up recommendations can be communicated to both patient and clinician.

[![Peak Skin Dose](/images/solutions/dose/peak-skin-dose.png)](/images/solutions/dose/peak-skin-dose.png)

## Nuclear Medicine

We have a lot of experience in the field of nuclear medicine and we offer extensive functionality and tools in this area, including logbook management (contamination, waste, purity of pharmaceuticals, etc.), as well as advanced dosimetry. Effective dose and organ doses are calculated automatically based of the conversion factors made available by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). Dose conversion factors can also be edited per case to depict the condition of the patient or the type of examination in a more accurate way. Data sources can be the hotlab management system, the NIS or RIS or even the PACS.

[![Nuclear Medicine](/images/solutions/dose/nuclear-medicine.png)](/images/solutions/dose/nuclear-medicine.png)

## Contrast Media Management

Do you want to get a quick overview of the consumption and costs of the contrast media used in your organization? DOSE’s contrast media management makes it very easy to perform in-depth analysis and obtain detailed information on the contrast media quantities used at various levels. Qaelum works directly with various manufacturers.

[![Contrast Media Management](/images/solutions/dose/contrast-media-management.png)](/images/solutions/dose/contrast-media-management.png)

## Analysis of Rejected Images

The radiation exposure of studies that have been rejected due to errors or quality defects is unfortunately often not taken into account and does not appear in the patient radiation dose passport. DOSE not only helps to automatically record these dose values, but also offers extensive possibilities for error analysis. In this way, users can gain insight into whether the device configuration should be checked or whether operator training might also be required.

[![Analysis of Rejected Images](/images/solutions/dose/analysis-of-rejected-images.png)](/images/solutions/dose/analysis-of-rejected-images.png)

## US & MRI Integration

Even modalities without ionizing radiation, such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, can be easily implemented and extensively analysed by DOSE. Room utilization and workflow analysis can be carried out in seconds, providing valuable information, e.g. whether it is relevant to purchase a new modality and with which equipment manufacturers the hospital staff work most efficiently. Numerous graphs and dashboards are available for this purpose.

[![US MRI Integration](/images/solutions/dose/us-mri-integration.png)](/images/solutions/dose/us-mri-integration.png)

## Management Tools

The moment evaluation graph allows you to simultaneously see the number of studies and the applied dose on a particular day and time. The statistical overview reveals differences in dose during the day versus night, morning versus afternoon and week versus weekend.

In addition, our software also provides workload analysis graphs, which monitor the (in)activity of different modalities. This tool can be used to optimize the use of your modality and the number of technicians per device.

Moreover, DOSE provides a centralized logbook where all the relevant events related to the modalities can be registered and followed-up. This is an easy way to have an overview of all your quality controls and technician visits, as well as to store and track the resulting reports. The origin of potential issues identified in device analysis can be found by simply going through the logged events of that device.

[![Management Tools](/images/solutions/dose/management-tools.png)](/images/solutions/dose/management-tools.png)

CMS
## **Product feature**

Recently, additional electronic clinical quality measures (eCQM) have been proposed by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that hospitals and critical care centers participating in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) program should adopt.

“Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level—Inpatient)” is one of these additional measures, which analysis is fully supported by the Qaelum dose management solutions. Using a validated algorithm, it allows you to

* simplify the setup of the needed software to calculate the needed CMS metrics
* better understand your current situation on excessive radiation dose and inadequate image quality
* gather insights that can help you understand where and how you can improve your outcome most
* automate internal reporting of the calculated metrics
* define and implement documented improvement plans
