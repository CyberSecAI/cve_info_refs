| Describe the bug SEGV on unknown address still exists in Assimp::XFileImporter::CreateMeshes.  ***This is similar to issue [#1728](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/1728). Note that [#1728](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/1728) reported wrong type of the vulnerability, as it is not a NULL pointer dereference. Patch [39ce3e1](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/commit/39ce3e1309b50681ea24b3109971582003fa83d5) was misguided by [#1728](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/1728), leaving this vulnerability unfixed.*** To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior: **version:** latest commit [3c253ca](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/commit/3c253ca3e5be69dc0eb7e9120278cd0a74deb9ac) **poc:**[null\_CreateMeshes.zip](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/files/9190065/null_CreateMeshes.zip)  ``` git clone https://github.com/assimp/assimp.git cd assimp mkdir build cd build CFLAGS="-g -O0" CXXFLAGS="-g -O0" cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF  -DASSIMP_BUILD_ASSIMP_TOOLS=ON  .. ./assimp info $POC  ``` Expected behavior ``` user@c3ae4d510abb:$ ./bin/assimp info poc Launching asset import ...           OK Validating postprocessing flags ...  OK 0 % Segmentation fault (core dumped)  ```  ``` user@c3ae4d510abb:$ ./bin/assimp info poc Launching asset import ...

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV (bin/assimp+0x131eed8) ==20088==ABORTING Aborted  ``` Vulnerability analysis Using gdb to trace this PoC, the vulnerability occurs in line 340 of XFileImporter.cpp, due to `idx=16256` is larger than the capacity of `sourceMesh->mNormals` (24).     [assimp/code/AssetLib/X/XFileImporter.cpp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/3c253ca3e5be69dc0eb7e9120278cd0a74deb9ac/code/AssetLib/X/XFileImporter.cpp#L337-L342)  Lines 337 to 342 in [3c253ca](/assimp/assimp/commit/3c253ca3e5be69dc0eb7e9120278cd0a74deb9ac)   |  | if ( mesh->HasNormals() ) { | | --- | --- | |  | if ( sourceMesh->mNormFaces[ f ].mIndices.size() > d ) { | |  | const size\_t idx( sourceMesh->mNormFaces[ f ].mIndices[ d ] ); | |  | mesh->mNormals[ newIndex ] = sourceMesh->mNormals[ idx ]; | |  | } | |  | } |      After tracing it, I found that `pMesh->mNormals` assigned `numNormals` elements in line 514-519 of `XFileParser.cpp`, then line 535-536 saved the result of `ReadInt` to `pMesh->mNormFaces[a].mIndices` without checking if it is in the correct boundary (`<numNormals`). This eventually leads to the bug above.     [assimp/code/AssetLib/X/XFileParser.cpp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/3c253ca3e5be69dc0eb7e9120278cd0a74deb9ac/code/AssetLib/X/XFileParser.cpp#L513-L541)  Lines 513 to 541 in [3c253ca](/assimp/assimp/commit/3c253ca3e5be69dc0eb7e9120278cd0a74deb9ac)   |  | unsigned int numNormals = ReadInt(); | | --- | --- | |  | pMesh->mNormals.resize(numNormals); | |  |  | |  | // read normal vectors | |  | for (unsigned int a = 0; a < numNormals; ++a) { | |  | pMesh->mNormals[a] = ReadVector3(); | |  | } | |  |  | |  | // read normal indices | |  | unsigned int numFaces = ReadInt(); | |  | if (numFaces != pMesh->mPosFaces.size()) { | |  | ThrowException("Normal face count does not match vertex face count."); | |  | } | |  |  | |  | // do not crah when no face definitions are there | |  | if (numFaces > 0) { | |  | // normal face creation | |  | pMesh->mNormFaces.resize(numFaces); | |  | for (unsigned int a = 0; a < numFaces; ++a) { | |  | unsigned int numIndices = ReadInt(); | |  | pMesh->mNormFaces[a] = Face(); | |  | Face &face = pMesh->mNormFaces[a]; | |  | for (unsigned int b = 0; b < numIndices; ++b) { | |  | face.mIndices.push\_back(ReadInt()); | |  | } | |  |  | |  | TestForSeparator(); | |  | } | |  | } |     Suggested fix Add a boundary check after `ReadInt` following the convention in line 410 below. Line 410 ensures the number read by `ReadInt` does not exceed the size of the vector.     [assimp/code/AssetLib/X/XFileParser.cpp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/3c253ca3e5be69dc0eb7e9120278cd0a74deb9ac/code/AssetLib/X/XFileParser.cpp#L394-L415)  Lines 394 to 415 in [3c253ca](/assimp/assimp/commit/3c253ca3e5be69dc0eb7e9120278cd0a74deb9ac)   |  | unsigned int numVertices = ReadInt(); | | --- | --- | |  | pMesh->mPositions.resize(numVertices); | |  |  | |  | // read vertices | |  | for (unsigned int a = 0; a < numVertices; a++) | |  | pMesh->mPositions[a] = ReadVector3(); | |  |  | |  | // read position faces | |  | unsigned int numPosFaces = ReadInt(); | |  | pMesh->mPosFaces.resize(numPosFaces); | |  | for (unsigned int a = 0; a < numPosFaces; ++a) { | |  | // read indices | |  | unsigned int numIndices = ReadInt(); | |  | Face &face = pMesh->mPosFaces[a]; | |  | for (unsigned int b = 0; b < numIndices; ++b) { | |  | const int idx(ReadInt()); | |  | if (static\_cast<unsigned int>(idx) <= numVertices) { | |  | face.mIndices.push\_back(idx); | |  | } | |  | } | |  | TestForSeparator(); | |  | } | |
