Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in the `editQuestion.php` file of the Interview Management System v1.0 by janobe. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter in the `editQuestion.php` file.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-supplied `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers may be able to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers might be able to gain unauthorized access to the system or escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `editQuestion.php` endpoint.
- **Manipulating `id` Parameter:** An attacker can inject SQL code into the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP GET requests.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL to craft malicious payloads to extract, modify, or delete data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/interview/editQuestion.php?id=` endpoint.
- The application uses the `sourcecodester_interviewdb` database.
- The provided payload `id=-6%20union%20select%201,database()--+` can be used to identify the vulnerability and leak information like the database name.
- Login details for a super admin account (`janobe@janobe.com/janobe`) are given, possibly for testing purposes.
