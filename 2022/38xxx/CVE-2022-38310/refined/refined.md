Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `SetStaticRouteCfg` function of the Tenda AC18 router firmware. This is due to the `sscanf` function improperly handling the input provided through the `list` parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stack Overflow:** The `sscanf` function is used to parse the input string, and the parsed data is stored on the stack using fixed-size buffers. When the input string contains a long string for the "WAN" parameter, `sscanf` writes beyond the bounds of these stack buffers, resulting in a stack overflow.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** There is a lack of proper validation on the length of the input provided to the `list` parameter.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that an attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the router.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** It is indicated that a carefully crafted overflow could potentially lead to remote code execution on the device.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint of the router's web interface.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface.
    *   **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker must know the specific vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg`) and how to craft the malicious `list` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in firmware versions V15.03.05.05\_multi and V15.03.05.19\_multi of the Tenda AC18 router.
* The vulnerable code snippet is within the `SetStaticRouteCfg` function, which calls `sub_781E8` and uses `sscanf` to parse the input.
* The `list` parameter is the main attack vector, where a long string in the "WAN" field causes the overflow.
