When remapping, use the same\n   test, and use is_note rather than the more restrictive\n   IS_COREFILE_NOTE.\n\nIt's important that the later tests not be more restrictive.  If they\nare it can lead to the situation triggered by the testcases, where a\nsection seemingly didn't fit and thus needed a new mapping.  It didn't\nfit the new mapping either, and this repeated until memory exhausted.\n\t\n\tPR 29495\n\t* elf.c (SEGMENT_END, SECTION_SIZE, IS_CONTAINED_BY_VMA): Delete.\n\t(IS_CONTAINED_BY_LMA, IS_NOTE, IS_COREFILE_NOTE): Delete.\n\t(segment_size, segment_end, section_size): New inline function.\n\t(is_contained_by, is_note): Likewise.\n\t(rewrite_elf_program_header): Use new functions.",
