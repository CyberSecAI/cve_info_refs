Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-38771:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user input when handling API requests, specifically allowing the injection of SQL script tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to unsanitized input being passed to the API.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Remote attackers can potentially manipulate the database via malicious SQL injection.
    *   This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service, depending on the attacker's ability to create SQL statements.
    *   It's possible the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify existing information, or even perform administrative tasks within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the mobile application by sending specially crafted API requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the vulnerable application. This implies the attacker would need some knowledge of the application's API structure.
*   The attacker must be able to inject SCRIPT tags as injected input to the API request.
*   The attacker would need to have some level of network access to communicate with the API endpoint (potentially through a mobile device connected to the internet).
