Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. Specifically, the "UserForm:j\_id90" parameter in the `/SVFE2/pages/feegroups/mcc_group.jsf` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Dump:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database. This could include user credentials, financial information, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the "UserForm:j\_id90" parameter within an HTTP request to the vulnerable `/SVFE2/pages/feegroups/mcc_group.jsf` endpoint.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the parameter's value using techniques such as quote character to break the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the SmartVista SVFE2 platform to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
