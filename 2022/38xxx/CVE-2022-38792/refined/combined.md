| I've sent a request to PyPI to have the Exotel 0.1.6 removed. Thanks again for raising this so quickly. |

| [@jertel](https://github.com/jertel) Since the dependency is unmaintained and only contains about 5 post request functions, maybe it's worth dropping the dependency entirely and implementing support directly inside elastalert itself? Additionally the package is only used inside the exotel alerter, so maybe a suitable spot for the code would be inside that alerter. A side discussion here is maybe making alerter dependencies optional? Then unless an alerter type is specifically used, the dependencies wouldn't even get pulled in, thereby reducing chances of these kinds of incidents affecting all users? |

| Implementing the Exotel integration directly into ElastAlert2 exotel.py file is fine with me, if you are up to submitting the PR. Optional dependencies would reduce risk but will still cause code scanners to trigger, simply by having the python code exist, even if the main codebase didn't include that module. So to avoid the code scanners from triggering you'd have to dynamically pull down the alerters from the Internet. I'm not opposed to the idea but it would be a significant change. |
