- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the RCON server of The Isle Evrima dedicated server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow. The RCON server's TCP connection handler does not properly validate the size of incoming data, specifically within the password command, allowing for an overflow. While there appears to be a limit on the password field itself, the vulnerability occurs later in the processing of the received data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is the ability to crash the server, leading to a denial of service. Sending a large enough buffer will cause an access violation or a stack buffer overrun, terminating the server process.
    - **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although the presence of a stack canary makes it more difficult, a skilled attacker could potentially bypass the canary and achieve remote code execution, which would grant them complete control over the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted TCP packet to the RCON server on port 8888. This packet contains a large amount of data within the password field of the RCON protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the RCON port (8888) of the vulnerable server. This could be a local attacker on the same network as the server, or a remote attacker if the RCON port is exposed to the internet. The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
