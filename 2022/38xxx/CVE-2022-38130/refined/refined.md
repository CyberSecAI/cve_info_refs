{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2022-38130": {
      "root_cause": "The `smsRestoreDatabaseZip()` method in Keysight Sensor Management Server (SMS) is vulnerable due to insufficient validation of the provided database zip file path.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Use of UNC path without proper sanitization",
         "Unauthenticated access to the vulnerable method"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can specify a UNC path to a malicious database zip file. When this file is processed, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements due to the usage of HSQLDB, which includes the ability to load attacker-controlled DLLs into the process, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the `smsRestoreDatabaseZip()` method via the network.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can remotely invoke the method over the network without authentication, and can specify an arbitrary UNC path to a malicious database zip file. The attacker does not need any special position to exploit the vulnerability, as long as they can reach the vulnerable server via the network."
