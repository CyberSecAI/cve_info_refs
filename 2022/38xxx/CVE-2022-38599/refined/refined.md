Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing access control validation in the `DoGetRoleListHandler` method within the Teleport application. This method retrieves a list of roles and their associated privileges without verifying the user's authorization to access this information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authorization checks on the `/user/get-role-list` endpoint. Any user, regardless of their permissions, can access the role list.
- **Information Disclosure:** The application leaks sensitive information regarding roles and their privileges which could potentially be exploited in further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can obtain a list of all defined roles and their corresponding privilege levels. This information can be used to understand the application's security model and identify potential targets for further attacks.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While this vulnerability itself does not directly provide privilege escalation, the exposed role and privilege information can be used to plan future attacks aimed at escalating user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack is performed via network access to the vulnerable endpoint `/user/get-role-list` by sending a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Teleport server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability due to the missing access control check.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability exists in Teleport versions 3.2.2, 3.5.6-rc6, and 3.6.3-b2.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) is provided, showcasing how to send a POST request to `/user/get-role-list` and receive the role list in response.
- The response includes role names and their associated privilege levels.
