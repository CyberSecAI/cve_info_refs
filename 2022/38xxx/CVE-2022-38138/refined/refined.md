- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Access of uninitialized pointers within the code of the TMW IEC 61850 Library and TMW 60870-6 (ICCP/TASE.2) Library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uninitialized pointers, which can be accessed by an attacker. This is identified as CWE-824.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial-of-service (DoS) condition on any server or client using the affected libraries.
- **Attack vectors:** Remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Low attack complexity, no special privileges required (can be exploited over the network without requiring any prior authentication).
