Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-38325.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` web server of Tenda AC15 and AC18 routers.
- The `filePath` parameter in the `/goform/expandDlnaFile` POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function.
- The `sprintf` output is written to a local variable on the stack, without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The lack of bounds checking when writing to the stack buffer allows an attacker to overwrite the return address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting the return address with a crafted payload, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted POST request to the `/goform/expandDlnaFile` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to control the `filePath` parameter, sending a long string to overflow the buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.
- Authentication is required, as the exploit code uses a session cookie (`password` cookie).
- The attacker needs to know the correct offsets for the libc library used by the router in order to construct the ROP chain.
- Network access to the router is required.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The provided exploit code shows how to authenticate to the router and send a crafted request.
- The exploit includes a ROP chain to execute the command `echo yab....` which demonstrates arbitrary code execution.
- The vulnerable code snippet is shown as a screenshot, which confirms the `sprintf` without proper size checks.
- The attack effect screenshot shows the outcome of the command injection, indicating successful exploitation.
- The vulnerable products are Tenda AC15 V15.03.05.19\_multi and AC18 V15.03.05.19\_multi
