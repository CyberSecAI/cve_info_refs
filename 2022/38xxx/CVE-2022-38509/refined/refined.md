```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'booking_id' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the /Wedding-Management-PHP/admin/budget.php page. The 'booking_id' parameter is vulnerable because the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input before using it in a SQL query.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's queries, potentially allowing them to access sensitive information from the database, modify data, or even gain control over the server. In this specific case, the attacker is able to determine the length of the database name.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'booking_id' GET parameter in the /Wedding-Management-PHP/admin/budget.php endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The provided examples use direct GET requests with the injected SQL payload. No authentication is explicitly mentioned, suggesting this could be exploitable by unauthenticated users."
