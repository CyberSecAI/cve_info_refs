- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing input validation allows injection of JavaScript code in customer name and table name fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browser of any user viewing the relevant content. This can lead to session token theft, credential theft, arbitrary actions on the user's behalf, and keystroke logging.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - For the customer name XSS, an external attacker can inject the payload during registration or reservation creation.
    - For the table name XSS, a privileged user (e.g., manager) can inject the payload while creating or modifying a table.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For the customer name XSS, an attacker needs to be able to register as a customer and make a reservation.
    - For the table name XSS, the attacker needs to have privileges to create and modify tables. The attacker also needs to trick an administrator into viewing a reservation linked to the malicious table.
