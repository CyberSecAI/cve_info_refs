Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize the `id` parameter in the `edit_event.php` file, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the URL, before using it in a database query.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application constructs SQL queries using string concatenation or similar methods with user-supplied data, rather than using prepared statements or parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive database information, such as database names, table structures, and user credentials. In the provided example, the attacker is able to retrieve the database name using `database()`.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, an attacker might be able to escalate their privileges or even execute operating system commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through an HTTP GET request to the `edit_event.php` file, specifically through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection.
*   **No Authentication Required** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable application is a Church Management System, version 1.0 by Godfrey De Blessed.
*   The specific vulnerable file is `cman/admin/edit_event.php`.
*   The provided payload is: `/cman/admin/edit_event.php?id=-1' union select 1,database(),3,4--+`
*   The attack was tested against a program built using xmapp-php8.1 version.
