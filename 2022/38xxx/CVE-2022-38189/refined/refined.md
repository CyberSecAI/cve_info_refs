- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input, leading to the ability to store malicious strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they access the stored malicious strings.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject malicious strings through crafted queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and able to craft queries. The attacker must convince the victim to access the stored malicious content.
