{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `database` webserver session backend in Apache Airflow was not properly handling session IDs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Session fixation vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by forcing them to use a known session ID.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the webserver session backend. The attacker could potentially trick a user into using a specific session id.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the session ID, potentially via a malicious link or other means. The attacker does not need to have any privileged access to the system before the attack."
