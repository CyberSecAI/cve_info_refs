| [CVE-2025-23042](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23042) | Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows quick building of demos and web application for machine learning models, API, or any arbitrary Python function. Gradio\'s Access Control List (ACL) for file paths can be bypassed by altering the letter case of a blocked file or directory path. This vulnerability arises due to the lack of case normalization in the file path validation logic. On case-insensitive file systems, such as those used by Windows and macOS, this flaw enables attackers to circumvent security restrictions and access sensitive files that should be protected. This issue can lead to unauthorized data access, exposing sensitive information and undermining the integrity of Gradio\'s security model. Given Gradio\'s popularity for building web applications, particularly in machine learning and AI, this vulnerability may pose a substantial threat if exploited in production environments. This issue has been addressed in release version 5.6.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | -- | Jan 14, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-23041](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23041) | Umbraco.Forms is a web form framework written for the nuget ecosystem. Character limits configured by editors for short and long answer fields are validated only client-side, not server-side. This issue has been patched in versions 8.13.16, 10.5.7, 13.2.2, and 14.1.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. | -- | Jan 14, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-23038](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23038) | WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `remuneracao.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `remuneracao.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim\'s browser, potentially compromising the user\'s data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | -- | Jan 14, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-23037](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23037) | WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `control.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `cargo` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `control.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim\'s browser, potentially compromising the user\'s data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | -- | Jan 14, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-23036](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23036) | WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `pre\_cadastro\_funcionario.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg\_e` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg\_e` parameter.

| [CVE-2025-23026](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23026) | jte (Java Template Engine) is a secure and lightweight template engine for Java and Kotlin. In affected versions Jte HTML templates with `script` tags or script attributes that include a Javascript template string (backticks) are subject to XSS. The `javaScriptBlock` and `javaScriptAttribute` methods in the `Escape` class do not escape backticks, which are used for Javascript template strings. Dollar signs in template strings should also be escaped as well to prevent undesired interpolation. HTML templates rendered by Jte\'s `OwaspHtmlTemplateOutput` in versions less than or equal to `3.1.15` with `script` tags or script attributes that contain Javascript template strings (backticks) are vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to version 3.1.16 or later to resolve this issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | -- | Jan 13, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-23025](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23025) | XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. NOTE: The Realtime WYSIWYG Editor extension was \*\*experimental\*\*, and thus \*\*not recommended\*\*, in the versions affected by this vulnerability. It has become enabled by default, and thus recommended, starting with XWiki 16.9.0. A user with only \*\*edit right\*\* can join a realtime editing session where others, that where already there or that may join later, have \*\*script\*\* or \*\*programming\*\* access rights. This user can then insert \*\*script rendering macros\*\* that are executed for those users in the realtime session that have script or programming rights. The inserted scripts can be used to gain more access rights. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.2, 16.4.1 and 16.6.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either disable the realtime WYSIWYG editing by disabling the ``xwiki-realtime`` CKEditor plugin from the WYSIWYG editor administration section or uninstall the Realtime WYSIWYG Editorextension (org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-realtime-wysiwyg-ui). | -- | Jan 14, 2025 |

| [CVE-2025-22828](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-22828) | CloudStack users can add and read comments (annotations) on resources they are authorised to access.  Due to an access validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions from 4.16.0, users who have access, prior access or knowledge of resource UUIDs can list and add comments (annotations) to such resources.  An attacker with a user-account and access or prior knowledge of resource UUIDs may exploit this issue to read contents of the comments (annotations) or add malicious comments (annotations) to such resources.  This may cause potential loss of confidentiality of CloudStack environments and resources if the comments (annotations) contain any privileged information. However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn\'t same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact. CloudStack admins may also disallow listAnnotations and addAnnotation API access to non-admin roles in their environment as an interim measure. | -- | Jan 13, 2025 |
