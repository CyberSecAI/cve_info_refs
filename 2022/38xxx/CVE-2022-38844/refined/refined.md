Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a CSV injection flaw present in EspoCRM 7.1.8. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when exporting data to CSV files. Specifically, it allows the injection of formulas into fields when creating contacts and accounts, which are then exported to a CSV file.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSV Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user input before exporting it to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to embed malicious formulas within the CSV data.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the contact input fields, which allows injecting CSV payloads in the first and last name fields.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** When a victim opens the maliciously crafted CSV file, the embedded formulas can be executed by spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. These formulas can potentially execute system commands, allowing an attacker to gain control of the victim's system.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** If the victim's system is part of an organization's network, an attacker could leverage the compromised system to launch further attacks within the network.
    *   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** With successful code execution, an attacker might be able to exfiltrate data from the victim's system or modify existing data.
    *   **No Direct Impact:** There is no direct impact to the application. The impact is based on where/how the user opens the exported CSV file.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **User-Supplied Input:**  An authenticated user can inject the malicious payloads through the application's web interface by creating contacts or accounts and including the malicious CSV formula in input fields like "first name" and "last name."
    *  **CSV Export:** The administrator exports the malicious data into a CSV file.
    *  **Victim Interaction**: A user opens the malicious CSV file on their machine, resulting in the execution of malicious code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the EspoCRM application.
    *   **Administrator Access:**  An administrator account is needed to export the data to a CSV.
    *   **Victim Action:** Requires the user to open the exported CSV file on their local machine for code execution.
