**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-38618

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL Injection vulnerability in the "Terminal Tariff Group" feature of SmartVista SVFE2. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application does not adequately sanitize or validate user-controlled input before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Dump: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to dump the entire database, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- Data Manipulation: An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- System Compromise: In some cases, successful SQL injection could lead to broader system compromise, depending on the database and environment configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered via the "UserForm:j\_id88,UserForm:j\_id90,UserForm:j\_id92" parameters in the `/SVFE2/pages/feegroups/country_group.jsf` URL.
- The attacker injects SQL code using a quote character to break out of the intended query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have an authenticated account on the SmartVista SVFE2 system to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable URL, including modifying the specified parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content gives a detailed example of how to inject SQL code and verify the success of the injection using error messages (ORA-01476).
- The content also specifies the affected version of SmartVista SVFE2 is 2.2.22 and earlier.
