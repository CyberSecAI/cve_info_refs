Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2022-38787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the firmware of some Intel FPGA products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation. This allows for the possibility of an attacker to manipulate input to cause unintended behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege. An authenticated user could potentially gain higher privileges than intended.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access. The attacker needs local access to the affected system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker must have valid credentials to access the system.
- Local access: The attacker must be able to execute code or interact with the system locally.
- The attack requires specific firmware versions to be present. Specifically, versions prior to 2.7.0 Hotfix are affected.

**Affected Products:**
- Intel® Agilex™ 7 FPGA and SoC FPGA product families.
- Intel® Stratix® 10 FPGA and SoC FPGA product families.

**Mitigation:**
- Update the affected FPGA product families to version 2.7.0 Hotfix or later.
