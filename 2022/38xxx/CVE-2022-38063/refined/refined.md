- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Social Login WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress site while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it (e.g., by including it in a link or an iframe on a malicious website).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice an authenticated user to click a malicious link or visit a webpage controlled by the attacker that executes the crafted request. The targeted user needs to have active, valid authentication to the WordPress site when the attacker's request is triggered.
