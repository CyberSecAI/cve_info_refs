# Janet Jackson had the power to crash laptop computers

A colleague of mine shared a story from Windows XP product support. A major computer manufacturer discovered that playing the music video for Janet Jackson’s “[Rhythm Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Nation)” would crash certain models of laptops. I would not have wanted to be in the laboratory that they must have set up to investigate this problem. Not an artistic judgement.

One discovery during the investigation is that playing the music video also crashed some of their competitors’ laptops.

And then they discovered something extremely weird: Playing the music video on one laptop caused a laptop sitting nearby to crash, even though that other laptop wasn’t playing the video!

What’s going on?

It turns out that the song contained one of the natural resonant frequencies for the model of 5400 rpm laptop hard drives that they and other manufacturers used.

The manufacturer worked around the problem by adding a custom filter in the audio pipeline that detected and removed the offending frequencies during audio playback.

And I’m sure they put a digital version of a “Do not remove” sticker on that audio filter. (Though I’m worried that in the many years since the workaround was added, nobody remembers why it’s there. Hopefully, their laptops are not still carrying this audio filter to protect against damage to a model of hard drive they are no longer using.)

And of course, no story about natural resonant frequencies can pass without a reference to  [the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/tacoma-narrows-bridge-collapses).¹

**Related**:  [Shouting in the Datacenter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDacjrSCeq4).

**Bonus chatter**:  [Video version of this story](https://twitter.com/WindowsDocs/status/1558114944738103297) and a  [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/WindowsDocs/status/1558115433449852929).

Also, [Larry Osterman](https://twitter.com/osterman) had a similar experience with  [a specific game that crashed a prototype PC](https://twitter.com/osterman/status/1558676353196494850).

**Follow-up**:  [Janet Jackson had the power to crash laptop computers, follow-up](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220920-00/?p=107201).

¹ **Follow-up 2**: Yes, I know that the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse was not the result of resonance, but I felt I had to drop the reference to forestall the “You forgot to mention the Tacoma Narrows Bridge!” comments.

In 2003, he began a Web site known as The Old New Thing which has grown in popularity far beyond his wildest imagination, a development which still gives him the heebie-jeebies. The Web site spawned a book, coincidentally also titled The Old New Thing (Addison Wesley 2007). He occasionally appears on the Windows Dev Docs Twitter account to tell stories which convey no useful information.

  This kind of issues are still very much present in today’s storage servers. I work for a company who specializes in Acoustic simulation and we help some customers to avoid having resonances create reading / writing problems in hard drives. The source of the noise / vibrations is often the cooling fan as companies are trying to compact more and more hard drives in the same volume, putting more constraint on the power for the fan to ensure thermal performances.

  I guess they were lucky in the recording studio that none of their machines had such drives. That would be some support call: “Every time we try and record this song all our machines crash!” I can just imagine that support call to Microsoft.

  There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation:

  Quote:

  True story: 7 Hz is the resonant

  frequency of a chicken's skull cavity.

  This was determined empirically in

  Australia, where a new factory

  generating 7-Hz tones was located too

  close to a chicken ranch: When the

  Why did they ruined the audio instead of making proper isolation for hard drives though? Filtering out frequencies from the audio without user’s consent because of crappy hardware is a very ugly workaround. And laptops can still be crashed by malicious actor using other audio devices.

  Mr. Chen, could you please clarify if your colleague in Windows XP product support witnessed this or if this is one of those urban legends that happened to “a friend of a friend”. Also, I’m wondering how you feel about [CVE 2022-38392](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-38392) which is entirely based on this blog entry. While it is hilarious to think that Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation is a Denial of Service attack, it seems almost preposterous that a laptop could be that shoddily built. Did they not have proper damping of vibrations?

  That said, I did analyze the frequency spectrum using Audacity and the most prominent peak is at 84⅛ Hz, which is a smidge higher than E2 on a piano. As it happens, 5400 Hz is a smidge higher than E6 (you’ll need an extended 108-key keyboard for that one). Being the same note, six octaves apart, I have to admit that if any song is going to cause problems due to resonant frequencies, Rhythm Nation would be it.

  This should be easy to test with a signal generator. If one has sox installed, you could simply run

  ```
  play -n synth sin E2
  ```

  and see what hard drives start logging ATA retries. Or, to be more accurate, one could use

  ```
  play -n synth sin 84.375
  ```

  which is 5400÷2⁶, while E2 is 82.40689 Hz.

    Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I recall my physics lessons correctly, resonance has little to do with the speed of rotation of an object\*\*, and more about the natural frequency of vibration for that object, which is linked to (1) its length, and (2) the speed of a wave traveling through that object (the latter affected by object composition, e.g. aluminum, steel, etc.; its stiffness/thickness, i.e. the stiffer it is the faster it'll...

    Correct me if I’m wrong, but if I recall my physics lessons correctly, resonance has little to do with the speed of rotation of an object\*\*, and more about the natural frequency of vibration for that object, which is linked to (1) its length, and (2) the speed of a wave traveling through that object (the latter affected by object composition, e.g. aluminum, steel, etc.; its stiffness/thickness, i.e. the stiffer it is the faster it’ll travel; and its mass, i.e. the heavier the slower the traveling wave will be). Actually, the length would be a pretty major factor since it would dictate which frequency an object is “vulnerable” to by resonance; alter its length and the “attack” frequency no longer has any effect. Make any sense?

    So, for a laptop HDD, for the length we would start with 2.5″ (so says <http://209.68.14.80/ref/hdd/op/mediaSize-c.html>) \*minus\* the diameter of the platter’s machined inner hole, with that measure then divided by 2 (i.e. the platter being a 2D annulus, the width of one of the two “bands” when you cut the annulus in half through its center).

    But I wouldn’t have a clue as to the natural frequency of a single 2.5″ HDD platter; either it needs to be determined experimentally, or else there may be tables for common materials (with given density) by their thickness (or engineering software stacks/packages capable of computing them).

    So, it’s probably more complicated than 5400RPM = 90 Hz.

    [\*\*wouldn’t angular momentum make platters \*less\* susceptible to vibration *perpendicular to their surface, i.e. along the normal*?]

      I think it's more complicated than that, even. Resonant modes of a flat disc with a hole in it would be determined by a set of partial differential equations that I don't even want to think about, but the solution would also depend on how the disc is supported - that is, if you took the platter out of the drive and hung it on a string, it would have different resonance than it does...

      It doesn’t have to be the platter, though – most of the drives I’ve torn apart had the heads on the end of long (relatively speaking) flat strips of spring steel, supported only at the end away from the head, so any resonance in them would have had its maximum amplitude at the head end, right where you really don’t want it.

    Many consumer laptops even as recently as 2013 didn't bother with any sort of dampening because that would increase cost. Netbooks (what anecdotes from other commenters seem to indicate was the likely place this occurred) would definitely not have had any due to both size and cost reasons. 10¢ of rubber dampening matters a lot when competing in the sub $300 category sadly.

    The story seems to centre around the video, which contains around 20 seconds of just above sub-bass at around 50Hz to 100Hz with a couple of strong 82.4Hz amongst it. Surprised it didn’t happen more (if the drives were built to not dampen this)!
