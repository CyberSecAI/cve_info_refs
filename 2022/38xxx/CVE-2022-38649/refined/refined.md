The provided content is related to a pull request on the Apache Airflow project, specifically about hardcoding the `pinot-admin.sh` command. However, this content **does not describe a security vulnerability** and is therefore **UNRELATED** to any specific CVE. It documents a code change where a command was hardcoded rather than parameterized, which is a functional change, not a security issue.
