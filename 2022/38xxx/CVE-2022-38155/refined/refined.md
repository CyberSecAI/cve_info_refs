Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the GitHub issue, which aligns with the CVE description:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing size check in the `TEE_Malloc` function within the `tee_api.c` file. The function directly passes the provided `len` parameter to the `tee_user_mem_alloc` function without validating if the requested size is within reasonable limits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unchecked Memory Allocation Size:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a check on the size parameter (`len`) passed to `TEE_Malloc`. This allows a caller to request an arbitrarily large memory allocation.
- **Integer Overflow/Excessive Memory Allocation:** While not explicitly mentioned, the lack of size validation could also lead to an integer overflow scenario if `len` is large enough, potentially resulting in a smaller-than-expected allocation, or an attempt to allocate an amount of memory that cannot be handled by the underlying memory management system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Invoking `TEE_Malloc` with an excessive size value will cause the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) kernel to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This prevents the trusted application and possibly the entire TEE from functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Function Invocation:** The vulnerability is triggered by invoking the `TEE_Malloc` function with an excessively large value for the `len` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Trusted Application (TA) Context:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a trusted application in the TEE. This means the attacker must have the ability to call the vulnerable `TEE_Malloc` function from within a TA.
- **Knowledge of API:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the `TEE_Malloc` API and the ability to control the size parameter (`len`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue specifically mentions that executing the statement `tee_user_mem_alloc` with an excessive size value on real IoT hardware (Numaker-PFM-M2351) crashes the TEE kernel.
- The provided source code snippet of `tee_api.c` confirms that the size check is indeed missing from the `TEE_Malloc` function.
- The issue was discovered by SyzTrust.
