# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1595

## Netgear Orbi Router RBR750 hidden telnet service command execution vulnerability

##### March 21, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-38452

##### SUMMARY

A command execution vulnerability exists in the hidden telnet service functionality of Netgear Orbi Router RBR750 4.6.8.5. A specially-crafted network request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Netgear Orbi Router RBR750 4.6.8.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

Orbi Router RBR750 - <https://www.netgear.com/support/product/RBR750>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-912 - Hidden Functionality

##### DETAILS

The Orbi Mesh Wi-Fi System creates dedicated high-speed Wi-Fi connections to your Internet service. The Orbi router (model RBR750) connects to your modem or gateway. The Orbi satellite (model RBS750) extends the Wi-Fi signal throughout your home.

Previous to recent hardware and software updates, the Netgear Orbi router series had a hidden debug page containing a toggle switch to enable the telnet service on the device `http://<router ip>/debug.htm`. However, recent updates have removed this switch and seemingly the ability to enable the service at all. While the switch in the GUI no longer functioned/was removed, enabling the service was still possible by sending a specially-crafted trigger packet to UDP port 23 (https://github.com/bkerler/netgear\_telnet). While recent updates have seemingly broken this tool (and the many tools like it), the service does still exist and is still triggerable.

The newer codebase uses a modified version of the Blowfish algorithm, which appears to be similar to older Nintendo DS cartridge protection code. Specifically the `crypt_64bit_up/down` functions with the constants `0x12, 0x112, 0x212,` and `0x312` in the PoC below.

```
def crypt_64bit_up(self, x, y):
    sbox = self.flattened_sBox
    pArray = self.flattened_pArray
    for i in range(0, 0x10):
        z = pArray[i] ^ x
        x = sbox[0x012 - 0x12 + ((z>>24)&0xff)];
        x = sbox[0x112 - 0x12 + ((z>>16)&0xff)] + x;
        x = sbox[0x212 - 0x12 + ((z>> 8)&0xff)] ^ x;
        x = (sbox[0x312 - 0x12+ ((z>> 0)&0xff)] + x) & 0xFFFFFFFF;
        x = y ^ x
        y = z
    x = x ^ pArray[-2]
    y = y ^ pArray[-1]
    return (x, y)

def crypt_64bit_down(self, x, y):
    sbox = self.flattened_sBox
    pArray = self.flattened_pArray
    for i in range(0x11, 1, -1):
        z = pArray[i] ^ x
        x = sbox[0x012 - 0x12 + ((z>>24)&0xff)];
        x = sbox[0x112 - 0x12 + ((z>>16)&0xff)] + x;
        x = sbox[0x212 - 0x12 + ((z>> 8)&0xff)] ^ x;
        x = (sbox[0x312 - 0x12+ ((z>> 0)&0xff)] + x) & 0xFFFFFFFF;
        x = y ^ x
        y = z
    x = x ^ pArray[1]
    y = y ^ pArray[0]
    return (x, y)

```

To trigger and enable this service, a username, password and MAC address of the target device’s `br-lan` interface are required.

# Security Advisory for Post-authentication Command Injection on the RBR750, PSV-2022-0186

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

First published: 2023-03-22

NETGEAR is aware of a post-authentication command injection security vulnerability on the RBR750 Orbi WiFi 6 Router. This vulnerability requires an attacker have all of the following information to be exploited:

* Your WiFi password or an Ethernet connection
* Your admin login and password
* Your router’s serial number and MAC address

NETGEAR is currently working on a fix for this vulnerability and plans to release it as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

Make sure that your admin password is sufficiently strong by utilizing the guidelines set forth by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA): https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2018/03/27/creating-and-managing-strong-passwords

### Disclaimer

Your use of the information in the document or materials linked from the document is at your own risk. NETGEAR reserves the right to change or update this document at any time. NETGEAR expects to update this document as new information becomes available.

The post-authentication command injection vulnerability remains if you do not complete all recommended steps. NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by following the recommendations in this notification.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1595

## Netgear Orbi Router RBR750 hidden telnet service command execution vulnerability

##### March 21, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-38452

##### SUMMARY

A command execution vulnerability exists in the hidden telnet service functionality of Netgear Orbi Router RBR750 4.6.8.5. A specially-crafted network request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Netgear Orbi Router RBR750 4.6.8.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

Orbi Router RBR750 - <https://www.netgear.com/support/product/RBR750>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-912 - Hidden Functionality

##### DETAILS

The Orbi Mesh Wi-Fi System creates dedicated high-speed Wi-Fi connections to your Internet service. The Orbi router (model RBR750) connects to your modem or gateway. The Orbi satellite (model RBS750) extends the Wi-Fi signal throughout your home.

Previous to recent hardware and software updates, the Netgear Orbi router series had a hidden debug page containing a toggle switch to enable the telnet service on the device `http://<router ip>/debug.htm`. However, recent updates have removed this switch and seemingly the ability to enable the service at all. While the switch in the GUI no longer functioned/was removed, enabling the service was still possible by sending a specially-crafted trigger packet to UDP port 23 (https://github.com/bkerler/netgear\_telnet). While recent updates have seemingly broken this tool (and the many tools like it), the service does still exist and is still triggerable.

The newer codebase uses a modified version of the Blowfish algorithm, which appears to be similar to older Nintendo DS cartridge protection code. Specifically the `crypt_64bit_up/down` functions with the constants `0x12, 0x112, 0x212,` and `0x312` in the PoC below.

```
def crypt_64bit_up(self, x, y):
    sbox = self.flattened_sBox
    pArray = self.flattened_pArray
    for i in range(0, 0x10):
        z = pArray[i] ^ x
        x = sbox[0x012 - 0x12 + ((z>>24)&0xff)];
        x = sbox[0x112 - 0x12 + ((z>>16)&0xff)] + x;
        x = sbox[0x212 - 0x12 + ((z>> 8)&0xff)] ^ x;
        x = (sbox[0x312 - 0x12+ ((z>> 0)&0xff)] + x) & 0xFFFFFFFF;
        x = y ^ x
        y = z
    x = x ^ pArray[-2]
    y = y ^ pArray[-1]
    return (x, y)

def crypt_64bit_down(self, x, y):
    sbox = self.flattened_sBox
    pArray = self.flattened_pArray
    for i in range(0x11, 1, -1):
        z = pArray[i] ^ x
        x = sbox[0x012 - 0x12 + ((z>>24)&0xff)];
        x = sbox[0x112 - 0x12 + ((z>>16)&0xff)] + x;
        x = sbox[0x212 - 0x12 + ((z>> 8)&0xff)] ^ x;
        x = (sbox[0x312 - 0x12+ ((z>> 0)&0xff)] + x) & 0xFFFFFFFF;
        x = y ^ x
        y = z
    x = x ^ pArray[1]
    y = y ^ pArray[0]
    return (x, y)

```

To trigger and enable this service, a username, password and MAC address of the target device’s `br-lan` interface are required.
