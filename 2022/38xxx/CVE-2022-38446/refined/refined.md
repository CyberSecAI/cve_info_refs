- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free (UAF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software contains a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This can allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have a way to trigger the vulnerability, most likely by opening a specially crafted file or interacting with the program in a specific way. The user is required to interact with the malicious input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to entice a user to open a malicious file or interact with the program in a way that triggers the vulnerability. This implies the attacker may not need initial access but needs to convince the user to interact with their malicious content.
