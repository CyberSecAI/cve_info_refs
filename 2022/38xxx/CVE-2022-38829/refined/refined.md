{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked strcpy operation in the `httpd/setMacFilterCfg` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of `strcpy` without proper bounds checking, leading to a potential overflow of the destination buffer when handling the `deviceList` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control of the router.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` endpoint with an overly long `deviceList` parameter. ",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device (typically on the local network if the router is not exposed to the internet). They also need knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter."
