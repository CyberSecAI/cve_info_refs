The provided content is related to CVE-2022-38639.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The markdown preview functionality of the `markdown-nice` project is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the markdown preview does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious scripts to be executed in the browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability. The provided markdown input is not properly sanitized, and then gets stored, enabling the exploit each time the stored content is loaded.
- Lack of input sanitization. The application does not properly filter or escape user-supplied markdown content, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
- Potential for account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- The XSS occurs in the community posting.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user injects a crafted markdown payload containing XSS code, such as  `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`, into a post, comment, or other user-editable content area that uses the markdown preview functionality.
- When a victim views the affected content, the embedded JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit markdown content to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to post the content where other users will be able to view it.
