The provided content is related to CVE-2022-38285.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is SQL injection vulnerabilities present in the JFinal CMS 5.1.0 application. The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection (SQLI)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and possibly gaining control of the underlying database server.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is located in several backend routes:
- `admin/videoalbum/list`
- `admin/video/list`
- `system/department/list`
- `system/menu/list`
- `system/role/list`
The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through vulnerable arguments passed to these routes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable routes in the backend. The default username and password for the admin account are provided as `admin:admin123`.
