Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the File Manager of Cuppa CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted File Upload: The system allows users to upload files without proper validation or restrictions on file types. This allows an attacker to upload malicious files, specifically PHP web shells in this case.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: By uploading a web shell (e.g., `attack.php`), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- File Manager: The vulnerability is located within the file manager functionality of Cuppa CMS.
- File Upload: The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file through the file manager's upload feature.
- Renaming and URL retrieval: The attacker uses the rename function (intercepted via BurpSuite), to rename the file and then uses the "show URL" button to get the URL to the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to Cuppa CMS File Manager: The attacker must have the necessary permissions to access the file manager feature.
- Web Request Interception: The attacker uses BurpSuite to intercept the request when renaming the file.
- Knowledge of URL: The attacker needs to obtain the URL of the uploaded web shell to execute the code.
