Release date: January 18, 2023

These release notes describe the new features, improvements, and fixed issues in Database Performance Analyzer 2023.1. They also provide information about upgrades and describe workarounds for known issues.

**Learn more**

* For information on the latest hotfixes, see [DPA hotfixes](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/DPA-Hotfixes?language=en_US).
* For release notes for previous DPA versions, see [Previous Version documentation](../previous_versions.htm).
* For information about requirements, see [DPA system requirements](../system_requirements/dpa_2023-1_system_requirements.htm).

## New features and improvements in DPA

[Return to top](#Top)

DPA 2023.1 offers new features and improvements compared to previous releases of DPA.

### Improvements to importing alerts, rules, and custom properties

DPA 2022.4 introduced the ability to export the alerts, rules, and custom properties that are configured on one DPA server and import them to another server. DPA 2023.1 improves the import functionality in the following ways:

* You can specify which entities to import. The import wizard displays a list of the alerts, rules, and custom properties to be imported. Clear the checkbox next to any entity you don't want to import.

  ![](../resources/images/import-custom-entities-select.png?ver=1736873887)
* You can choose to overwrite existing entities with the same name. If you overwrite an entity, the existing entity is replaced by the imported entity.

### Additions to systems requirements and monitored instances

| Category | Vender and version |
| --- | --- |
| Repository database | Microsoft SQL Server 2022, Windows or Linux |
| Monitored database instances | Microsoft SQL Server 2022, Windows or Linux |
| VMware | VMware vCenter Server 7.0  VMware ESX/ESXi Host 7.0 |

For more information, see the [DPA 2023.1 system requirements](../system_requirements/dpa_2023-1_system_requirements.htm) and [Database instances DPA can monitor](../dpa-database-versions-you-can-monitor.htm).

## Fixed issues in DPA 2023.1

[Return to top](#Top)

DPA 2023.1 fixes the following issues.

| Case number | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 01144021, 01233510, 01234275 | In deployments with an Oracle repository that monitor Oracle database instances, index analysis runs successfully. Logs no longer include the error message `Unable to run index analysis`. |
| 01080326, 01129290, 01234534, 01236488 | Files in the `/tomcat/logs/` directory, such as `catalina.out`, `stderr.log`, and `catalina.YYYY-MM-DD.log`, no longer grow quickly and consume a large amount of space. |
| 00978208, 01076887 | Collecting a large number of metrics (for example, because you have configured many custom metrics), can sometimes cause DPA monitoring to stop periodically. DPA 2023.1 includes metrics setting in the system.properties files that can be adjusted to avoid this issue. For information on adjusting these properties, see [Scale DPA for the number of databases being monitored and the number of custom metrics](https://www.solarwinds.com/documentation/kbloader.aspx?kb=5941). |
| 00560405, 00850966, 01061361, 01128672 | In previous versions, when DPA was installed on Windows the installer ran a VBS script to create the Windows service. If an organization had a security policy that prevented VBS scripts from running, the service was not created and DPA would not start. To prevent this issue, DPA 2023.1 runs a Powershell script instead of a VBS script. |

## SolarWinds CVEs

SolarWinds would like to thank our Security Researchers below for reporting on the issue in a responsible manner and working with our security, product, and engineering teams to fix the vulnerability.

| CVE-ID | Vulnerability Title | Description | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2022-38110 | Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability | In DPA 2022.4 and older releases, certain URL vectors are susceptible to authenticated reflected cross-site scripting. | 6.3 Medium |
| CVE-2022-38112 | Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability | In DPA 2022.4 and older releases, generated heap memory dumps contain sensitive information in cleartext. | 6.3 Medium |

**Notes - BugCrowd**

SolarWinds would like to additionally thank our Bugcrowd community for their continued help in testing our products and keeping them secure

## New customer installation

[Return to top](#Top)

For information about installing DPA, see the [DPA Installation and Upgrade Guide](../dpa_installation_guide.htm). You can download a free trial from the [SolarWinds website](https://www.solarwinds.com/database-performance-analyzer).

## Before you upgrade!

If you are upgrading from DPA 2022.3 and you configured that version for SAML authentication, be aware that 2022.4 and later versions include changes to the SAML configuration. After the upgrade, no one will be able to log in with SAML until you update the configuration.

* **Before** you upgrade, make sure you have a local login available.
* **After** the upgrade, log in as a local user and complete the steps under [SAML configuration changes](dpa_2022-4_release_notes.htm#SAML con) in the DPA 2022.3 release notes to update the SAML configuration.

## How to upgrade

If you are upgrading from an earlier version, use the following resources to plan and implement your upgrade:

* Use the [DPA Installation and Upgrade Guide](../dpa_installation_guide.htm) to help you plan and execute your upgrade.
* When you are ready, download the upgrade package from the [SolarWinds Customer Portal](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/ "https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/").

## Known issues

[Return to top](#Top)

| Importing an alert definition without the associated database assignment rule | |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue** | In some situations, the log file shows the status of an imported alert definition as both Imported and Failed. This occurs when the alert definition uses a database assignment rule, but the rule was not imported and did not already exist on the server.  The two statuses indicate that the alert definition was imported but the attempt to associate the database assignment rule failed. |
| **Resolution or Workaround** | When you import an alert definition that uses a database assignment rule, either import the rule or ensure that it already exists on the server.  If you imported an alert definition and the associated rule is missing, you must [edit the alert definition](../dpa-edit-alert.htm) to specify the database instances. (You can specify instances by manually selecting them or by applying a rule.) |

| REST API does not work when you access DPA with SAML login credentials | |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue** | If you access DPA with SAML login credentials and you generate a refresh token, the following message is displayed when you attempt to use that refresh token to access the REST API:  `You are not authorized to perform this action. Contact your DPA administrator.` |
| **Resolution or Workaround** | Access DPA with a local login when you generate the refresh token. |

| The database name is not updated for stored procedures | |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue** | If a stored procedure name includes the name of a database and it is copied to a different database, the database name is not updated. When DPA shows information about the copied stored procedure, the hash is the same as the first and the information appears to be incorrect. |
| **Resolution or Workaround** | If you experience this issue, complete the following steps:   1. Run the following command against the DPA repository database (replacing `<HashValue>` with the stored procedure's hash value):  `delete from ignite.CONST_<DBID> where H = '<HashValue>'` 2. [Restart DPA.](../dpa-stop-and-start-dpa.htm) |

| Registering an Azure SQL database instance fails when the privileged user is an Azure AD user | |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue** | When registering an Azure SQL database, if you let DPA create the monitoring user and select an Azure Active Directory (AD) user as the privileged user, registration fails on the last step with the message `Connection test to database as monitoring user failed`. |
| **Resolution or Workaround** | Select the option 'I'll create the contained user or login', and follow the instructions to [create the monitoring user manually](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/dpa/content/dpa-register-an-azure-sql-database.htm). |

| Adding a distributed AG to a server prevents DPA from monitoring non-distributed AGs on the server | |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue** | If DPA is monitoring non-distributed SQL Server Availability Groups (AGs) on a server and you add a distributed AG to the server, DPA stops monitoring the non-distributed AGs. |
| **Resolution or Workaround** | Do not add a distributed AG to the server. |

| Microsoft reports incorrect metric values for SQL Server on Linux | |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue** | When you monitor a **SQL Server 2017** database instance that runs on a Linux server:   * The O/S CPU Utilization resource always shows usage at 100%. * The Instance CPU Utilization resource always shows usage at 100%. * The O/S Memory Utilization resource always shows usage at 0%.   When you monitor a **SQL Server 2019** database instance that runs on a Linux server:   * The O/S CPU Utilization resource always shows usage at 100%. * In some cases, the Instance CPU Utilization resource always shows usage at 100%.   Microsoft reports these values. |
| **Resolution or Workaround** | Disregard the values that are incorrect on your version of SQL Server. You can also [disable the collection of a metric](../dpa-disable-metric-data-collection.htm) that shows incorrect data. |

| DPA fails to reconnect after losing its connection to a SQL Server instance | |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue** | When DPA loses its connection to a monitored SQL Server instance (for example, when the DPA server is rebooted), and Windows authentication is used, DPA is sometimes unable to reconnect to the instance. This can happen if DPA attempts to connect before SQL Server has been able to connect to Active Directory. DPA interprets the rejected connection attempt as possibly occuring because the credentials were incorrect. To avoid being locked out of the account, DPA does not keep trying to reconnect. Messages such as the following appear in the logs:  `Monitor for database [databaseName] failed to start due to [username and/or password must be updated due to previous login failure; if the credentials have not changed for this database, stop the monitor, wait for the monitor to stop, then start the monitor.].` |
| **Resolution or Workaround** | When the monitored instance is fully initialized, manually restart monitoring. On the DPA home page, click the Action drop-down menu for the instance and select Start Monitor. |
