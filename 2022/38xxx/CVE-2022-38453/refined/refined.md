- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The presence of active debug code in multiple binary application files of the Contec Health CMS8000 device due to 'not stripped' and 'debug_info' compilation settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Active debug code in binary files.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability makes it easier for a threat actor to reverse engineer the code and identify additional vulnerabilities. It also allows access to sensitive information and modification of device functionality, with limited impact on confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors**:  Local access to the device
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker requires local access and must be a privileged user to exploit this vulnerability. The attack complexity is high, as reverse engineering knowledge is required.
