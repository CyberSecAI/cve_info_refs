Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `/interview/delete.php` script where the `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.
* **Weakness/Vulnerability:** SQL Injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before incorporating it into a SQL query.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries through the `id` parameter, leading to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can extract sensitive database information using SQL injection techniques, such as using `updatexml` to extract the database name as shown in the provided payload.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** While not explicitly demonstrated in this specific example, SQL injection can also allow attackers to modify or delete data within the database if they craft specific malicious queries.
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can often be a stepping stone to further attacks like gaining shell access to the server if the database is configured in a way that allows such access.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/interview/delete.php` with the malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application server to send the crafted HTTP request.
    *   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and SQL syntax is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided payload uses `updatexml` function to extract the database name which demonstrates that it is an error-based SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Interview Management System by janobe.
*   The provided Github content includes the exact vulnerable file and parameter along with a working payload.
