- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Garage Management System v1.0 allows arbitrary file uploads through the `editProductImage.php` file without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload, lack of input sanitization and validation of file types, which leads to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can upload malicious PHP files, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a web request to `editProductImage.php` with a crafted multipart/form-data POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable `editProductImage.php` endpoint, requires authentication as a super admin. The attacker also needs to craft a malicious PHP file.
