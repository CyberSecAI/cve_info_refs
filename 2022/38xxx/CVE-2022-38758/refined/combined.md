## 2.0 System Requirements

For information about prerequisites, computer requirements, installation, upgrade or migration, see [Planning to Install iManager](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/imanager-32/imanager_install/data/b1gti9p6.html) in the [NetIQ iManager Installation Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/imanager-32/imanager_install/data/bookinfo.html).

*NOTE:*iManager uses the modified version of XULRunner on Windows. The source code for the modified XULRunner is available under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0. If you need further assistance with any issue, contact [Technical Support](http://www.netiq.com/support).

## 3.0 Installing or Upgrading

To upgrade to iManager 3.2 SP6, you need to be on iManager 2.7.7 P11 or higher.

For more information on upgrading to iManager 3.2 SP6, see the [NetIQ iManager Installation Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/imanager-32/imanager_install/data/bookinfo.html).

IMPORTANT:

* This version of iManager supports only eDirectory 9.2.6 or above when both are installed on the same machine. If you are upgrading iManager 2.7.7 P11 to 3.2 SP6, ensure that your eDirectory is also upgraded to 9.2.6 before upgrading iManager.
* When you install or upgrade to iManager 3.2 SP6, a new imanager\_logging.xml file is created that includes the latest log4j 2.17.1 capabilities. During the upgrade process, the existing imanager\_logging.xml file is replaced with a new one. As a result, the previous audit settings are lost. To allow auditing for iManager events, you must configure the audit settings again in the new imanager\_logging.xml file after the upgrade. Make sure to take a backup of the existing file in a different location before performing the upgrade. For more information, see [Auditing iManager Events](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/imanager-32/imanager_admin/data/buj9whg.html) in the [NetIQ iManager Administration Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/imanager-32/imanager_admin/data/bookinfo.html).
