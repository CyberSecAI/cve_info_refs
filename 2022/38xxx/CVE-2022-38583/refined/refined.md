{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Sage 300 installer uses a folder off the root of \"C:\\\" as the default installation path (e.g., C:\\Sage\\Sage300) instead of the more conventional “C:\\Program Files\\” or “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\”, and does not correctly set the folder permissions. The folder inherits insecure permissions from the parent directory, allowing members of the 'Authenticated Users' group to modify the contents of the Sage 300 installation folder and its subfolders. Additionally, the installer prepends the “C:\\Sage\\Sage300\\RUNTIME\\” directory to the system PATH variable, making it a part of the DLL Search Order.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure folder permissions",
       "Insecure system PATH modification"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation to SYSTEM level access and complete system compromise through various methods.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cross-user attacks by replacing Sage 300 binaries with malicious ones.",
      "Exploiting services that run as “Local System” by replacing their binaries with malicious ones.",
      "Uploading a webshell to the Sage 300 Web Screens directory to gain code execution as the Local System account.",
      "DLL hijacking by planting malicious DLLs in the Sage 300 folder included in the system PATH variable"
   ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker only needs to have a low-privileged account on the target system to exploit the vulnerability. No admin access is required."
