Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Tenda AC15 and AC18 router's web server (httpd). Specifically, the vulnerability is present in how the `/goform/NatStaticSetting` page handles POST request parameters. The `page` parameter's value is directly used within a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking when copying the `page` parameter's value into a stack-allocated buffer using `sprintf`.
    *  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The router does not sanitize the input provided in the 'page' parameter of the POST request which leads to the vulnerability

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, attackers can overwrite the return address of the function. This allows them to redirect execution flow to arbitrary locations, ultimately leading to the execution of malicious code.
    *   **Remote Control of Router:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain full control of the vulnerable router.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/NatStaticSetting` endpoint.
    *  **Malicious Parameter:** The attacker must provide a malicious payload in the `page` parameter of the POST request.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This likely means being on the same local network or having port forwarding set up.
    *   **Authentication Bypass (Not explicitly stated but implied):** The provided PoC and exploit include a login step, suggesting the attacker must authenticate (or have a valid session cookie), or be able to bypass the authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the content:**

*   The provided exploit code includes the necessary authentication step, indicating the vulnerability requires valid credentials for exploitation.
*   The exploit code specifically calculates the offset to overwrite the return address on the stack, injects shellcode, and includes gadgets to execute system commands.
* The provided PoC screenshot demonstrates the ability to send the malformed POST request and affect the router functionality.

In summary, the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that is triggered by a specially crafted HTTP request and can lead to arbitrary code execution.
