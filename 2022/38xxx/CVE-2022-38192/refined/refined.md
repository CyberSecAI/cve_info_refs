- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and later executed in a user's browser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user who accesses the stored malicious strings. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject the malicious scripts by submitting crafted queries, and a user with low privileges is needed to trigger the vulnerability by accessing the stored malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted queries and store the malicious code on the target application. No prior authentication is required, however a low privileged user is needed to trigger the stored XSS.
