  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Outdated Bluetooth pairing mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect Access Control",
      "Use of outdated pairing mechanisms"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can passively intercept a Bluetooth pairing handshake, and after offline cracking, retrieve the PIN and long-term key (LTK). This could allow for unauthorized access to the device or the network it connects to.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Bluetooth pairing interception"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range during a pairing handshake, able to intercept and passively record the exchange, and possess the capability to perform offline cracking."
