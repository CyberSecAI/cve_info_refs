CVE-2022-38788

CVSS v3.1 Vector:AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L (5,5)

[Description]

An issue was discovered in Nokia FastMile 5G Receiver 5G14-B
with software version 1.2104.00.0281.

Bluetooth on the Nokia ODU uses outdated pairing mechanisms, allowing
an attacker to passively intercept a paring handshake and (after
offline cracking) retrieve the PIN and LTK (long-term key).
