[`0badce7`](/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/0badce7840e3fdb9f6d94e13488bec358fd0472d)

## Quick Start

### Non-HA:

```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.3.6/manifests/install.yaml
```
### HA:

```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.3.6/manifests/ha/install.yaml
```
### Security fixes

* HIGH: Certificate verification is skipped for connections to OIDC providers ([GHSA-7943-82jg-wmw5](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-7943-82jg-wmw5))
* LOW: A leaked API server encryption key can allow XSS for SSO users ([GHSA-pmjg-52h9-72qv](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-pmjg-52h9-72qv))

### Potentially-breaking changes

The fix for [GHSA-7943-82jg-wmw5](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7943-82jg-wmw5 "GHSA-7943-82jg-wmw5") enables TLS certificate validation by default for connections to OIDC providers. If

connections to your OIDC provider fails validation, SSO will be broken for your Argo CD instance. You should test 2.3.6

before upgrading it to production. From the new documentation:

> By default, all connections made by the API server to OIDC providers (either external providers or the bundled Dex
>
> instance) must pass certificate validation. These connections occur when getting the OIDC provider's well-known
>
> configuration, when getting the OIDC provider's keys, and when exchanging an authorization code or verifying an ID
>
> token as part of an OIDC login flow.
>
> Disabling certificate verification might make sense if:
>
> * You are using the bundled Dex instance **and** your Argo CD instance has TLS configured with a self-signed certificate
>
>   **and** you understand and accept the risks of skipping OIDC provider cert verification.
> * You are using an external OIDC provider **and** that provider uses an invalid certificate **and** you cannot solve
>
>   the problem by setting `oidcConfig.rootCA` **and** you understand and accept the risks of skipping OIDC provider cert
>
>   verification.
>
> If either of those two applies, then you can disable OIDC provider certificate verification by setting
>
> `oidc.tls.insecure.skip.verify` to `"true"` in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap.

### Bug fixes

* fix: webhook typo in case of error in GetManifests ([#9671](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/9671))

## Package

gomod

github.com/argoproj/argo-cd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

0.4.0 through 2.2.10, 2.3.5, 2.4.4

## Patched versions

2.2.11, 2.3.6, 2.4.5

## Description

### Impact

All versions of Argo CD starting with v0.4.0 are vulnerable to an improper certificate validation bug which could cause Argo CD to trust a malicious (or otherwise untrustworthy) OIDC provider.

(Note: external OIDC provider support was added in v0.11.0. Before that version, the notes below apply only to the bundled Dex instance.)

You are impacted if 1) have SSO enabled and 2) insecure mode is *not* enabled on the API server. In this case, certificate verification is skipped when connecting to your OIDC provider for the following tasks: verifying auth tokens on API requests and handling SSO login flows. If you are using the bundled Dex instance but have *not* set the `--dex-server` flag on the API server to an HTTPS address, then certificate verification is not being skipped (because [TLS is not enabled by default for the bundled Dex instance](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/9424)).

Argo CD sends requests to the configured OIDC provider (either the bundled Dex instance or an external provider) to 1) retrieve the [OpenID configuration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig), 2) to retrieve the OIDC provider's key set (at the location determined by the [OIDC provider's configured `jwks_uri`](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata)), and 3) (during an SSO login) to exchange an authorization code for a token.

(Note: Starting with v2.3.0, certificate verification is *not* skipped when handling an SSO login flow if 1) you are not using the bundled Dex OIDC provider and 2) you have set `oidc.config.rootCA` in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. Certificate verification is still skipped when verifying tokens on API calls.)

Skipping certificate verification when communicating with the OIDC provider opens Argo CD to a variety of risks. For example, if an attacker can successfully intercept, decrypt, and respond to requests bound for the configured OIDC provider (a machine-in-the-middle attack), they could theoretically issue a "valid" admin token. Verifying the OIDC provider's certificate provides an extra layer of protection against such an attack.

### Patches

A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:

* v2.4.5
* v2.3.6
* v2.2.11

**Note:**

To preserve backwards compatibility, this patch adds a `oidc.tls.insecure.skip.verify` option to the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. The default is `"false"`. Before resorting to setting this, you should try to get certificate verification to work. If you are using the bundled Dex instance, user your Argo CD API server's [TLS configuration](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/tls/) since the API server acts as a reverse proxy to Dex. If you are using an external OIDC provider, [set the `rootCA` config](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/#configuring-a-custom-root-ca-certificate-for-communicating-with-the-oidc-provider).

If these fail, be sure you are aware of the risks before setting `oidc.tls.insecure.skip.verify: "true"`.

### Workarounds

There is no complete workaround besides upgrading.

#### Partial mitigation when using an external OIDC provider

If you are using an external OIDC provider (not the bundled Dex instance), then you can mitigate the issue by setting the `oidc.config.rootCA` field in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. If your OIDC provider's certificate is self-signed or otherwise invalid, you must set the rootCA to a certificate that enables verification. If the OIDC provider's certificate passes *without* an additional root CA, then you can set `oidc.config.rootCA` to a bogus non-empty string such as `"force cert verification"`. The API server will log a warning, but otherwise things should work fine.

Example:

```
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  oidc.config: |
    ...
    rootCA: |
      force cert verification
```

This mitigation *only* forces certificate validation when the API server handles login flows. It does not force certificate verification when verifying tokens on API calls. To fully resolve the vulnerability, you must upgrade.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
