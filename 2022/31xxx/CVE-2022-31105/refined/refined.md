Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is improper certificate validation when Argo CD connects to OIDC providers. Specifically, certificate verification is skipped during various stages of communication with the OIDC provider (retrieving OpenID configuration, retrieving the key set, and exchanging authorization codes during SSO login flows).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-295:** Improper Certificate Validation - The core issue is the failure to properly validate certificates of the OIDC provider.
- **CWE-599:** Missing Certificate Validation - The system misses certificate validation for OIDC provider connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially perform a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting, decrypting, and responding to requests intended for the OIDC provider.
- Successfully performing a MITM attack could allow the attacker to issue "valid" admin tokens, granting them unauthorized access and control over the Argo CD instance.
- The impact is significant, potentially leading to a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Argo CD system and any resources managed by it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, implying that the attacker needs to be positioned to intercept the communication between Argo CD and the OIDC provider.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the Argo CD instance and its configured OIDC provider.
- The attacker must be able to decrypt and forge responses in order to successfully impersonate the OIDC provider.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the Argo CD instance itself, but would require a position in the network that allows interception of relevant traffic.
- User interaction is required during an SSO login, but after the user is logged in and an admin token is issued, the attack can continue without further user interaction.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all Argo CD versions from v0.4.0 to v2.2.10, v2.3.5, and v2.4.4.
- Patched versions are v2.2.11, v2.3.6, and v2.4.5.
- A temporary mitigation (for external OIDC providers) involves setting `oidc.config.rootCA` in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap, but this does not fully resolve the vulnerability.
- The severity is rated as High with a CVSS score of 8.4.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a security audit of the Argo project.
