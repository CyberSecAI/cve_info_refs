### Summary
The provided content reveals a SQL injection vulnerability in the Directory Management System v1.0, specifically within the `view-directory.php` file through the `editid` parameter.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `editid` parameter in the `view-directory.php` file, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization on the `editid` parameter.

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to:
   - **Database Information Disclosure:** Extract sensitive information from the database, such as the database name, table names, and user credentials.
   - **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data in the database.

### Attack vectors
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `view-directory.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `editid` parameter.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
- **Basic knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to know how to construct malicious SQL queries to exploit the vulnerability effectively.
