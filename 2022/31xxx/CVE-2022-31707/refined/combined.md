VMware vRealize Operations Cloud Appliance (vRealize Operations Cloud Proxy) 8.10.1 | 2022 | Build 20938221

Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.

## What's New

This is a maintenance release for vRealize Operations which resolves a few important security and functionality issues identified in the product and an added feature. For more details about defects that have been fixed, see [KB 89886](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89886).

**Product Support Notice**

**vRealize Application Remote Collector**

vRealize Application Remote Collector is not supported from vRealize Operations 8.10 and above. Migrate all Telegraf end points to cloud proxy before upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.10 and above. For information about migrating from vRealize Application Remote Collector to cloud proxy, see [KB 83059](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83059).

**What's New in This Release**

**Granular Settings for Conservative Risk-Level**

You can tune the level of conservativeness from one to five, with level 1 being the least conservative and level 5 being the most conservative. The default strength of conservativeness remains the same as in the previous releases and corresponds to level 3. Modifying the level of conservativeness will make the projection bounds narrower or wider. Higher the level, the wider the upper bound and more conservative the projections for Time Remaining, Capacity Remaining, and Recommended Size.

Note:

* Rare and momentary peaks may be considered outliers and may not impact the projections even at the most conservative risk level.
* Conservativeness strength is supported by the Conservative risk level. The Aggressive risk level produces Time Remaining, Capacity Remaining, and Recommended Size metrics always based on the mean of the projection.

For all other what's new content in 8.10.x, see the [vRealize Operations 8.10 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations/8.10/rn/vrealize-operations-810-release-notes/index.html).

**Metrics and Properties Modifications**

The following KB article describes all the metrics and properties that have been modified in vRealize Operations 8.10.1:

[Metrics added in vRealize Operations 8.10](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89589)

**Instanced Metrics**

Instanced metrics are deactivated by default after deploying or upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.2 or later, and after importing a policy from older versions. To re-activate instanced metrics in vRealize Operations 8.2 or later, see [KB 81119](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/81119).

**Basic Authentication**

Basic authentication using the REST API is deprecated and deactivated in vRealize Operations 8.10.1 fresh deployments by default. Instances that have been upgraded to vRealize Operations 8.10.1, will inherit the same properties before the upgrade. It is recommended that you use token-based authentication instead. If you still need to activate or deactivate basic authentication, see [KB 77271](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77271).

**Active Directory Authentication Sources**

Logging in to vRealize Operations with a short name will be successful only if the user name's domain suffix matches the domain name specified in the **Base DN** option. Otherwise, the full user name with the domain suffix is required during login. For more information, see [KB 68131](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/68131)

## System Requirements

Review this section before you install or update vRealize Operations.

Sizing and Scaling

The CPU, memory, and disk requirements that meet the needs of a particular environment depend on the number and type of objects in your environment and data collected. This includes the number and type of adapters installed, the use of HA (High Availability) and CA (Continuous Availability), the duration of data retention, and the quantity of specific data points of interest. VMware updates [Knowledge Base article 2093783](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2093783) with the most current information about sizing and scaling. The Knowledge Base article includes overall maximums and spreadsheet calculations that provide a recommendation based on the number of objects and metrics you expect to monitor.

Deployment Formats

You can deploy vRealize Operations 8.10.1 with VMware virtual appliance.

If you are deploying a vRealize Operations virtual appliance and vRealize Operations Cloud Appliance (cloud proxy), use a VMware vSphere Client to connect to a VMware vCenter Server, and deploy the virtual appliance through the vCenter Server instance. The vRealize Operations virtual appliance and vRealize Operations Cloud Appliance (cloud proxy) must be deployed on hosts that are:

* ESX/ESXi 6.5 Update 1 or later and managed by VMware vCenter Server 6.5 or later.
* If you have vRealize Operations virtual appliance deployed on ESXi 6.0 or older hosts, you must first upgrade vCenter Server and ESXi to version 6.5 Update 1 or later, and then upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.10.1.

## Hardware Versions, Cipher Suites and Protocols, and Log4j

**Hardware Versions**

The minimum hardware version required for vRealize Operations 8.x releases is version 11. If your vRealize Operations virtual appliance had a hardware version earlier than 11, you must first upgrade to hardware version 11 on vRealize Operations virtual appliance and then upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.10.1.

**Cipher Suites and Protocols**

For information about cipher suite lists and relevant protocols, see [Cipher Suites and Protocols](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations/8.10/com.vmware.vcom.scg.doc/GUID-171B7B96-4CF3-4803-94CE-2947AB646176.html).

**Log4j version** is at 2.17.2.

## VMware Product Compatibility

VMware Product Compatibility

**Note:** The [VMware Product Interoperability Matrix](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php) provides details about the compatibility of vRealize Operations with VMware products.

**Note:** For FIPS mode compatibility details, see the footnotes in the interoperability matrix. The product will not work in FIPS mode if there are footnotes that state that it will not work in FIPS mode.

## Solutions and Browser Support

Solutions Support

In addition to the VMware solutions (vSphere, vRealize Log Insight, vSAN, Service Discovery, NSX-T, and many more), see the [VMware Marketplace](https://marketplace.vmware.com/vsx/) for many more solutions. These solutions work with Virtual Appliance single or multiple nodes.

Browser Support

This vRealize Operations release supports all current Web browsers, although only the following browsers were tested with this release:

* Google Chrome: Version 108
* Mozilla Firefox: Version 107.0.1
* Microsoft Edge: Version 107 and 108
* Safari: 16.1

**Note:** Support for Internet Explorer has been dropped from vRealize Operations 8.4 onwards.

## SDDC Compliance

Ensure compliance of your vSphere, vSAN, and NSX-T resources deployed across private datacenters, and other VMware Managed Clouds such as VMware Cloud on AWS, Azure VMware Solution, Google Cloud VMware Engine, and VMware Cloud on Dell EMC using various compliance packs in vRealize Operations. Supported versions of vSphere inlcude 6.5, 6.7, and 7.0, NSX-T includes 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, and NSX-V includes 6.3.x and 6.4.x objects.

vRealize Operations 8.10.1 includes compliance alerts for the [VMware vSphere 7 Security Configuration Guide](https://core.vmware.com/vmware-vsphere-7-security-configuration-guide) and does not include the rule set for vSphere Secure Configuration Guide 7 Update 3.

**Note:** Some alerts and symptoms are available only for backward compatibility with older versions of vSphere, even though the current release supports the latest vSphere Security Configuration Guide 7.

## Installing and Upgrading vRealize Operations

**Upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.10.1, resets out-of-the-box content as part of the software upgrade process. This implies that the user modifications made to default content such as alert definitions, symptom definitions, recommendations, policies, views, dashboards, widgets, and reports are overwritten. You need to clone or backup the content before you upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.10.1.**

**Notes:**

* To see the supported direct upgrade path, refer to the [Product Interoperability Matrix](https://interopmatrix.vmware.com/Upgrade?productId=116).
* While upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.10.1, the expected size of the /dev/sda for Photon OS is 20 GB (hard disk 1). For information about this requirement, see [KB 75298](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/75298).
* It is always recommended to run the Pre-Upgrade Assessment tool before an upgrade. A pre-upgrade assessment report that is generated will provide you with the recommended replacements. This tool provides you with an impact analysis following the reduction of metrics in various versions of the product. For more details on using the Pre-Upgrade Assessment Tool, see [KB 90434](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90434).

## Known Issues

* [Installation and Upgrade Issues](#Known Issues-Installation and Upgrade Issues)
* [General Issues](#Known Issues-General Issues)
* [User Interface Issues](#Known Issues-User Interface Issues)

### Installation and Upgrade Issues

* **vRealize Operations upgrade from 8.6.4 to 8.10.1 fails**

  vRealize Operations upgrade from 8.6.4 to 8.10.1 fails due to a missing Cassandra table vmwarecloudonawscomputationratio.

  **Workaround:** See [KB 90606](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90606) or upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.10.2.
* **Upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.10.1 will impact some management packs**

  When you upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.10.1, some management packs might not be compatible with JDK11 and would require an upgrade to a JDK11 compatible version. Contact the vendor to confirm if the management pack is compatible with vRealize Operations 8.10.1.

  **Workaround:** See [KB 89675](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89675) for more details.
* **The PAK file upload process is slower in vRealize Operations 8.10.1**

  The vRealize Operations 8.10.1 upgrade PAK file may take longer to upload and may sometimes not complete uploading if you are using Firefox as a browser through a high latency network.

  **Workaround:** Use another supported browser to upload the PAK file and start upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.10.1.
* **After you upgrade vRealize Operations from 8.4 to a later release, content upgrade and agent management actions fail**

  After you upgrade vRealize Operations from a previous release, content upgrade and agent management actions fail on vRealize Operations on-prem and vRealize Operations Cloud when you also upgrade cloud proxy.

  **Workaround:**

  Complete the following steps:

  1. SSH to the Cloud Proxy VM.
  2. Run the following command: */rpm-content/ucp/subsequentboot.sh*

  You can view the log from the following location: */opt/vmware/var/log/ucp-subsequentboot*
* **Upgrade might fail if any of the nodes are running on VMs with US/Pacific-New timezone**

  PostgreSQL database systems no longer support the US/Pacific-New timezone, which was just an alias for America/Los\_Angeles timezone. If any of the vRealize Operations nodes are running on VMs with US/Pacific-New timezone, upgrade might fail.

  **Workaround:** Change VM timezones from US/Pacific-New to America/Los\_Angeles, and then upgrade.

### General Issues

* **Telegraf agent related operations fail as ports 4505 and 4506 are not reachable**

  Salt ports 4505 and 4506 become unreachable while performing Telegraf agent related operations.

  **Workaround:** See [KB 90448](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90448) for more details.
* **Agent install fails with the error: **Connect to salt master****

  When you install an agent to monitor applications using Telegraf, the following error may occur: `Connect to Salt Master`. The error occurs because the end point VM is unable to connect with the salt master.

  Workaround: Verify the ownership of the folders in *`/ucp/salt/pki/master`* in cloud proxy. The ownership must be admin/admin. If the ownership is not admin, reset permissions/ownership.

  1. Run the `/ucp/ucp-config-scripts/ucp-firstboot.sh` script and verify the permissions of the folder.
  2. Reinstall the agent after successful execution of the script.

  Agent install should be successful.
* **JBoss server running in domain mode does not support LCM using custom Telegraf**

  You cannot deploy jolokia.war across all the servers that run as a part of the JBoss domain mode and hence metrics cannot be collected.

  **Workaround:** Monitoring domain mode configuration in JBoss is supported in open source Telegraf. You can deploy jolokia.war across multiple servers.
* **The Add button in the Manage Telegraf Agents page remains activated after the creation of an application service**

  While monitoring specific application services using Telegraf, the Add button in the Manage Telegraf Agents page is active after the creation of the second instance of the following application services: MSIIS, Active Directory, SharePoint, MSExchange, and Network Time Protocol.

  **Workaround:** Delete the previous configurations of the specific application services and configure a new one.
* **Concurrent activation or deactivation of plugins during application monitoring using suite-api does not work**

  During application monitoring using suite-api, when you activate or deactivate plugins concurrently, plugin activation or deactivation does not work. An exception is logged in the ucpapi.log file.

  **Workaround:** Provide a gap of one second between each thread during activation or deactivation of the plugins using suite-api.
* **When you get an application instance's configuration status using a Rest-API call, a wrong status is returned when the same configuration was installed or uninstalled previously**

  If you installed or uninstalled an application instance and then uninstalled or installed it respectively, the API returns "SUBMITTING" when you try to get the application instance install or uninstall configuration status using "GET /api/applications/agents/services/{taskId}/status".

  **Workaround:** While getting the application instance configuration status using the "GET /api/applications/agents/services/{taskId}/status" API, ensure that you use the latest performed task ID. The result of calls with older IDs is undefined.
* **When you upgrade from vRealize Operations 8.1 to 8.10.1, the Cassandra application service is displayed as Java Application in the Services Discovered/Configured column of the Manage Telegraf Agents tab**

  During application monitoring, after you upgrade from vRealize Operations 8.1 to 8.10.1, the Cassandra application service is displayed as Java Application in the Services Discovered/Configured column of the Manage Telegraf Agents tab. This happens if the Cassandra application service is configured for monitoring in vRealize Operations 8.1, using the vRealize Application Remote Collector generic Java plugin.

  **Workaround:** Deactivate the Java plugin before you upgrade the vRealize Application Remote Collector agent on the VM. After upgrading the vRealize Application Remote Collector agent, the Cassandra plugin will be discovered and can then be activated.
* **System language settings affects service discovery**

  Service discovery might not work if the system language is different from English. For languages different from English, network connection state values might be different from constants defined in standard RFCs.

  **Workaround:** None
* **Reconfigure the Project Price widget if the vRealize Automation 8.x integration is deactivated and then reactivated**

  There is data missing in the **Project Price** widget of the **Cloud Automation Project Price Overview** dashboard when you deactivate and then reactivate an existing vRealize Automation 8.x integration.

  **Workaround:** Reconfigure the **Project Price** widget by completing the following steps:

  1. After you deactivate and then reactivate the vRealize Automation 8.x integration, navigate to **Dashboards** > **vRealize Automation 8.x** > **Cloud Automation Project Price Overview** dashboard.
  2. Edit the **Project Price** widget.
  3. Navigate to the **Input data** section.
  4. Select the **'+' (Add Object)** button and select the CAS World object from **vRealize Automation Adapter 8.x > CAS World**.
  5. Click **OK**.
  6. Navigate to the **Output data** in the same widget configuration mode. Search for and select the CAS Project Price View object from the list.
  7. Save the widget.
* **While monitoring applications, you cannot activate a plugin with the same fields till the plugin configuration is deleted**

  An error message is displayed in the user interface of vRealize Operations that states the following: 'Failed to update resource: Resource with same key already exists'.

  **Workaround:** Manually delete the existing plugin configuration and then continue with the activation of the plugin. If the problem persists, delete the corresponding resource from the inventory.
* **Alerts from the vSAN adapter that correspond to vSAN health check tests are not canceled if the test is removed from the vSAN Health Service.**

  vRealize Operations cannot detect and cancel deleted alerts.

  **Workaround**: Manually cancel the alert from the user interface of vRealize Operations.
* **Despite deleting ucp-adapter instance certificates, users can run actions**

  If users delete ucp-adapter instance certificates, they can still run actions such as, start and stop an agent, configure remote checks, and so on.

  **Workaround:** None
* **HTTP Post Adapter is deprecated in vRealize Operations 7.0 and above**

  Re-activating the HTTP Post Adapter can open vRealize Operations to security flaws.

  **Workaround**: Complete the steps in [KB 60328](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/60328).
* **The compliance score for a user with limited object visibility is the same as for a user with complete object visibility**

  The compliance score is calculated for objects that are not visible (not assigned) to the current user.

  **Workaround:** Complete the following steps:

  1. Create a custom group with objects visible (assigned) to the user.
  2. For that group, apply a policy in which the needed set of compliance alert definitions is activated.

     If that set is activated only in one active policy (the one that is applied to the custom group), the compliance benchmark based on those alert definitions will display the correct score.

### User Interface Issues

* **After upgrading cloud proxy and vRealize Operations to 8.10.1, the VM name is not appended to the MSSQL instance**

  After upgrading cloud proxy and vRealize Operations to 8.10.1, the VM name is not appended to the MSSQL instance for existing or newly activated plugins.

  **Workaround**: None
* **The Last Year option in the date picker is not intuitive**

  The Last Year option in the date picker indicates that the time range starts from the end of the previous month and goes back a year. It does not indicate a time range that spans one year from the current date or the whole previous year.

  **Workaround**: None
* **A PDF report file might not include all data from a widget that has a scrollbar**

  When you generate a report that contains a custom dashboard with a widget that has a scrollbar, the downloaded PDF file might not include all the data in the widget.

  **Workaround:** Increase the height of the widget in the dashboard to fit all the data.
