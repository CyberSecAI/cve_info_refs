The content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `image` parameter passed within the `$_REQUEST['data']` variable in the `native-support/export.php` file. This allows for a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input sanitization and validation for the `image` parameter.
- Usage of `curl_init` with a user-controlled URL, allowing the server to make requests to arbitrary locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can induce the server to make requests to unintended locations. This could include internal network resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing further attacks like port scanning.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a POST request to `export.php` with a malicious URL within the `data` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, which is generally accessible to users of the application.
