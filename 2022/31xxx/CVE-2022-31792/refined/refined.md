- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the management interface of WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the management interface of the affected devices.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Firebox management interface. This could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, modification of settings, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specially crafted requests to the exposed management ports of the Firebox to inject the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the exposed management ports of the vulnerable device. The attacker does not require authentication.
