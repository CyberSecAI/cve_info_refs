Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to the listed CVEs:

**General Root Cause:**

All of the listed CVEs stem from the same root cause: **unsafe usage of the `Flask` framework's `send_file` function.** Specifically, the applications pass user-controlled input directly to the `send_file` function without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for **absolute path traversal**.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Absolute Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can manipulate the filename or path parameters to access files outside of the intended directory. This is possible because the application directly uses user-provided paths in the `send_file` function call without validating the path for unsafe characters like `..`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can expose sensitive data like source code, configuration files, database credentials, or other private information.
*  **Availability**: In some cases an attacker may cause a partial denial of service by making multiple requests to access large files, though the impact on availability is generally low.
*   **Scope Change:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to access resources outside the security scope of the web application, potentially affecting other components of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is typically performed remotely through network requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Malicious requests are crafted with manipulated URL parameters that control the file path argument being passed to Flask's `send_file` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **No authentication:** None of the provided content indicates that any authentication is needed for this vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is consistently described across different repositories as a result of unsafely using `Flask`'s `send_file` function.
*   The vulnerability is often found in simple Flask apps that do not have the proper security measures.
*   Many of the affected repositories appear to be personal projects or hobby applications.
*  Several of the reports mention that the issue is being found using CodeQL scans, and is an example of a known code pattern for path traversal.
* Some entries also mention that the issue was fixed by sanitizing user input with `flask.safe_join` or using `flask.send_from_directory` instead of `flask.send_file`.
