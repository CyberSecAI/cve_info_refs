| **Version** 0.14.12  **Description** Hyper does not open the customization of the max\_header\_list\_size method in the H2 third-party software. The H2 interface is as follows:  ``` /// Sets the max size of received header frames.     ///     /// This advisory setting informs a peer of the maximum size of header list     /// that the sender is prepared to accept, in octets. The value is based on     /// the uncompressed size of header fields, including the length of the name     /// and value in octets plus an overhead of 32 octets for each header field.     ///     /// This setting is also used to limit the maximum amount of data that is     /// buffered to decode HEADERS frames.     ///     /// # Examples     ///     /// ```     /// # use tokio::io::{AsyncRead, AsyncWrite};     /// # use h2::server::*;     /// #     /// # fn doc<T: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin>(my_io: T)     /// # -> Handshake<T>     /// # {     /// // `server_fut` is a future representing the completion of the HTTP/2.0     /// // handshake.     /// let server_fut = Builder::new()     ///     .max_header_list_size(16 * 1024)     ///     .handshake(my_io);     /// # server_fut     /// # }     /// #     /// # pub fn main() {}     /// ```     pub fn max_header_list_size(&mut self, max: u32) -> &mut Self {         self.settings.set_max_header_list_size(Some(max));         self     } ```  The default value of max\_header\_list\_size in h2 is 16m. As a result, HTTP2 attacks may occur when Hyper is used.  Attack scenario: Hyper is used as the server and continues to send continuance frames without ending. The data of each continuance frame is 10 KB. Each thread sends 1023 continuance frames, that is, about 10 MB. Multiple threads are started to send continuance frames. As a result, the memory of the service is exploded. |

| The max\_header\_list\_size option of H2 is critical. Why did you not add it? What are the considerations?  ``` h2/src/codec/framed_read.rs ...                 // Extend the buf                 if partial.buf.is_empty() {                     partial.buf = bytes.split_off(frame::HEADER_LEN);                 } else {                     if partial.frame.is_over_size() {                         // If there was left over bytes previously, they may be                         // needed to continue decoding, even though we will                         // be ignoring this frame. This is done to keep the HPACK                         // decoder state up-to-date.                         //                         // Still, we need to be careful, because if a malicious                         // attacker were to try to send a gigantic string, such                         // that it fits over multiple header blocks, we could                         // grow memory uncontrollably again, and that'd be a shame.                         //                         // Instead, we use a simple heuristic to determine if                         // we should continue to ignore decoding, or to tell                         // the attacker to go away.                         if partial.buf.len() + bytes.len() > self.max_header_list_size {                             proto_err!(conn: "CONTINUATION frame header block size over ignorable limit");                             return Err(Connection(Reason::COMPRESSION_ERROR));                         }                     }                     partial.buf.extend_from_slice(&bytes[frame::HEADER_LEN..]);                 } ... ``` |

| Note, the client is vulnerable to this, too, but is not yet fixed.  I don't currently have a need for it being fixed, just wanted to document it, as discussion elsewhere was confused about this:  Both directions of HTTP have headers, v2 specs the related advisory setting for both directions. The underlying h2 does have this setting for both client and server since almost its beginning, which comes with a default limit of 16MB.  For this to be a problem the application does need to have some thing else going on whose denial of service by memory exhaustion would be a problem. This something else might be requests to other servers that are not in the same security compartment. Or having taken a lock that needs to be released. Or it might be even a totally unrelated thing, like showing a GUI. Based on the 16MB default and the maximum outstanding in flight requests and the available memory you can calculate if this can be a problem. So a CLI application that just one command, which does one request, then exits anyway and is prepared to be killed at any time (instead of needing to avoid allocation failures) doesn't need this setting. |

1. [refactor(server): move non-conn code out of conn.rs](/hyperium/hyper/commit/0fec1c8737e84bfccf0cd6495564ba465442cd1e)
    …

   ```
   The actual code for `Server` was previously organized very confusingly:
   it was thrice layered with `SpawnAll` and `Serve` which both appeared in
   conn.rs despite not having anything to do with the lower-level conn API.
   This commit changes that, removing all layering and having the code for
   the higher-level `Server` appear inside `server.rs` only.

2. [refactor(server): simplify server cfgs](/hyperium/hyper/commit/dd08d9c3e59657b637cf29a31f62bd6815a1e04b)
    …

   ```
   `server.rs` is currently littered with `cfg`s for `http1` or `http2`,
   since the majority of server behaviour is only available with either one
   of those feature flags active. This is hard to maintain and confusing to
   read, so this commit extracts the two implementations into their own
   files, since there is very little benefit in sharing code between the
   two.
   ```

1. [refactor(capi): make early returns consistent in C examples (](/hyperium/hyper/commit/1d895b8dfce0a19dcc84d96b6df9e2fdc6ac4294)[#2812](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2812)[)](/hyperium/hyper/commit/1d895b8dfce0a19dcc84d96b6df9e2fdc6ac4294)
    …

   ```
   - Since the `if` condition already causes the loop to `break`,
     the `else` is not necessary. We wouldn't have reached the `else`
     block, anyway, if the prior `if` condition passed.
   - We are more likely to poll a successful chunk than finish
     the request or throw an error. Thus, it is best if we go
     for the optimistic route and check for the successful
     case first.
   ```

1. [feature(ffi): add connection option to preserve header order (](/hyperium/hyper/commit/78de8914eadeab4b9a2c71a82c77b2ce33fe6c74)[#2798](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2798)[)](/hyperium/hyper/commit/78de8914eadeab4b9a2c71a82c77b2ce33fe6c74)
    …

   ```
   Libcurl expects that headers are iterated in the same order that they
   are recieved. Previously this caused curl tests 580 and 581 to fail.
   This necessitated exposing a way to preserve the original ordering of
   http headers.

   SUMMARY OF CHANGES: Add a new data structure called OriginalHeaderOrder that
   represents the order in which headers originally appear in a HTTP
   message. This datastructure is `Vec<(Headername, multimap-index)>`.
   This vector is ordered by the order which headers were recieved.
   Add the following ffi functions:
   - ffi::client::hyper_clientconn_options_set_preserve_header_order : An
        ffi interface to configure a connection to preserve header order.
   - ffi::client::hyper_clientconn_options_set_preserve_header_case : An
        ffi interface to configure a connection to preserve header case.
   - Add a new option to ParseContext, and Conn::State called `preserve_header_order`.
     This option, and all the code paths it creates are behind the `ffi`
     feature flag. This should not change performance of response parsing for
     non-ffi users.

   Closes [#2780](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2780)

   BREAKING CHANGE: hyper_clientconn_options_new no longer
     sets the http1_preserve_header_case connection option by default.
     Users should now call
     hyper_clientconn_options_set_preserve_header_case
     if they desire that functionality.
   ```

2. [feat(server): add](/hyperium/hyper/commit/a32658c1ae7f1261fa234a767df963be4fc63521) `[Connection::http2_max_header_list_size](/hyperium/hyper/commit/a32658c1ae7f1261fa234a767df963be4fc63521)` [option (](/hyperium/hyper/commit/a32658c1ae7f1261fa234a767df963be4fc63521)[#2828](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2828)
    …

   ```
   )

   This allows setting the HTTP/2 `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` which advertises to the peer the maximum header size allowed, and internally is enforced.

   Closes [#2826](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2826)
