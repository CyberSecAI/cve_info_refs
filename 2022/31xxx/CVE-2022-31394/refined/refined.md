The provided content relates to CVE-2022-31394.

Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `hyper` crate, specifically in its HTTP/2 server implementation, did not allow configuring the `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE`. The underlying `h2` crate did have this setting, which defaults to 16MB, but it was not exposed to users of hyper.
- This lack of configuration meant that an attacker could send a large number of CONTINUATION frames with large headers, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting server memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for uncontrolled memory consumption due to the lack of a configurable maximum header list size. This can lead to a DoS.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Configuration:** Hyper did not provide an option to set a limit for the maximum size of received header frames, which could be abused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a stream of large headers, an attacker can force the server to allocate excessive memory, potentially leading to a crash or making the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP/2 requests with large headers.
- **CONTINUATION Frames Abuse**: The attacker sends multiple CONTINUATION frames without ending, with a large amount of header data per frame. This exploits the lack of a maximum size limit, leading to uncontrolled memory usage and DoS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the vulnerable server.
- **HTTP/2 knowledge:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of the HTTP/2 protocol, specifically the use of CONTINUATION frames, to craft malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a `http2_max_header_list_size` option to the `hyper::server::Builder`, allowing users to set a maximum size for header lists.
- This issue affects the server side. There is a mention that the client is also vulnerable but not yet fixed.
- The vulnerability was addressed in PR #2828 and closed by commit `a32658c`.
- The issue was initially mislabeled as a bug, but later correctly categorized as a feature request.
- The default value in the `h2` crate is 16MB, which can still be exploited to cause a DoS depending on the application and its resources.
