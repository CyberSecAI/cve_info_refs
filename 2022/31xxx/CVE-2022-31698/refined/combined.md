Server Configuration Issues

Adding ESXi hosts to an Active Directory Domain by using the VMware vSphere Authentication Proxy service might fail

Due to some additional permission checks from the vSphere Authentication Proxy service, adding an ESXi host to an Active Directory domain might fail. The

issue is specific for vSphere Authentication Proxy configurations where some users do not have Domain Admins privileges on the Active Directory.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix reduces the user access checks by the vSphere Authentication Proxy service to only the required minimum.

vSAN Issues

You see vSAN health events and alarms even when vSAN is disabled

In rare cases, you might see vSAN health events and alarms even when vSAN is disabled on cluster, but such events do not impact any functionality.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Auto Deploy Issues

The VMware Service Lifecycle Manager service (vmon) cannot load the proxy config file for Image Builder due to [Errno 13] Permission denied error

In certain environments, due to incorrect file permissions, the vmware-rhttpproxy microservice might fail to load the vmware-imagebuilder proxy configuration file. In

the vmon service logs, you see a message such as: Error in loading endpoint file /etc/vmware-rhttpproxy/endpoints.conf.d/imagebuilder-proxy.conf. Details

[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/vmware-rhttpproxy/endpoints.conf.d/imagebuilder-proxy.conf'.

This issue is resolved in this release.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1588

## VMware vCenter Server Content Library denial of service vulnerability

##### December 13, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-31698

##### SUMMARY

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the Content Library functionality of VMware vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3t. A specially-crafted HTTP header can lead to denial of service. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

VMware vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3t

##### PRODUCT URLS

vCenter Server - <https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.6 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-834 - Excessive Iteration

##### DETAILS

VMware vCenter Server is a platform that enables centralized control and monitoring over all virtual machines and EXSi hypervisors included in vSphere.

A pre-authentication denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `resourcebundle` handler of the `cls (Content Library)` service.
Let us take a look at the vulnerable part of the code. Going down to the implementation of “/cls/resourcebundle/\* handler, at some point we reach code located in the “SsoAuthenticatedFileStreamServlet.java” file.

```
Line 45  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException {
Line 46    try {
Line 47      if (logger.isDebugEnabled())
Line 48        logger.debug(String.format("doGet: Entering (%s)", new Object[] { httpServletRequest.getRequestURI() }), new Object[0]);
Line 49      if (this._ssoEnabled)
Line 50        try {
Line 51          byte[] payload = IOUtils.toByteArray((InputStream)httpServletRequest
Line 52              .getInputStream());
Line 53          SsoOverRestVerifierUtil.verifySecurityHeader(
Line 54              httpServletRequest,
Line 55              payload,
Line 56              Arrays.asList(this._stsTrustChain.getStsTrustChain()),
Line 57              300,
Line 58              3600);
Line 59        } catch (com.vmware.cis.services.common.sso.SsoOverRestVerifierUtil.SsoAuthException e) {
Line 60          logger.error((Throwable)e, "doGet: SSO verification failed for client " +
Line 61              getRemoteClientInfo(httpServletRequest), new Object[0]);
Line 62          httpServletResponse
Line 63            .setStatus(401);
Line 64          return;
Line 65        }

```

Going further into `SsoOverRestVerifierUtil.verifySecurityHeader` :

```
com.vmware.cis.services.common.sso.SsoOverRestVerifierUtil.java

Line 62  private static SamlToken verifySecurityHeaderImpl(HttpServletRequest request, byte[] extractedPayload, List<X509Certificate> certificates, int clockToleranceSecs, int maxRequestAgeSecs) throws SsoAuthException {
Line 63    try {
Line 64      AuthVerifier verifier = AuthVerifierFactory.instance(certificates.<X509Certificate>toArray(new X509Certificate[certificates.size()]), clockToleranceSecs, maxRequestAgeSecs);
Line 65      String[] authHeaders = parseSecurityHeader(request);
Line 66      SsoOverRestRequest reqParam = SsoOverRestHelper.createSsoOverRestRequest(request, extractedPayload);

```

Finally we reach the vulnerable function `parseSecurityHeader`:

```
Line 36  private static String[] parseSecurityHeader(HttpServletRequest request) {
Line 37    int parts = Integer.parseInt(request.getHeader("TokenParts"));
Line 38    String[] authHeaders = new String[parts];
Line 39    for (int i = 0; i < parts; i++)
Line 40      authHeaders[i] = request.getHeader("TokenPart" + i);
Line 41    return authHeaders;
Line 42  }

```

As you can see, an attacker sending an integer value in an http header field called `TokenParts` can control the number of loop iterations `lines 39-40`, plus has an influence on size of memory allocation `line 38`.
Huge numbers sent as a `TokenParts` value will cause a high memory and CPU usage in the vCenter server and might result in a temporary denial of service.

#### Issue/Introduction

[VMSA-2022-0030](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0030.html)  details vulnerabilities in vCenter Server 6.7 & 7.0 and VMware ESXi 6.7 & 7.0. These vulnerabilities are remediated in the releases [vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3i](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-70u3i-release-notes.html) and [ESXi 7.0 Update 3i](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u3i-release-notes.html).
These issues have also been fixed in [vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3s](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-67u3s-release-notes.html) and [VMware ESXi 6.7, Patch Release ESXi670-202210001](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/esxi670-202210001.html).

[VMSA-2022-0033](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0033.html) details vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi 7.0. These are remediated in [VMware ESXi 7.0 Update 3i](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u3i-release-notes.html)

This KB documents the process should customers running VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.x, 3.11.x or 4.x wish to update their vCenter Server and ESXi hosts.

Symptoms:
As documented in [VMSA-2022-0030](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0030.html), vCenter Server 6.7 & 7.0 and Vmware ESXi 6.7 & 7.0 is affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the advisories.

As documented in [VMSA-2022-0033](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0033.html), VMware ESXi 7.0 is affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the advisories.

Since the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 3.10.x, 3.11.x and 4.x versions bundle the impacted releases of vCenter Server and VMware ESXi ; VCF 3.10.x, 3.11.x and VCF 4.x releases are similarly impacted by the vulnerabilities listed in the advisory.

Networking Issues

Networking Issues

In vSphere environments with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) installed, the vpxd service might become unresponsive

In vSphere environments with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure ACI installed, the vpxd service might not properly handle ESXi host local ports and become

unresponsive. In the vpxd.log, you see errors such as: ODBC error: (22003) - ERROR: numeric field overflow;.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Miscellaneous Issues

NFC file copy operations intermittently fail in an IPv6 environment

During NFC copy in IPV6 environment, if IPv6 addresses in the NFC Copy Spec for the source and destination contain uncompressed sequence of zeroes, the spec

validation fails because IPv6 addresses do not match with that of the hosts stored values. As a result, the NFC copy and the operation that invoked the NFC copy

fail. For example, when you attempt to deploy a template from Content Library. The issue does not affect IPv4 environments.

This issue is resolved in this release.

After update to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3r, the vpxd service might not start due to lack of disk space, caused by content-library-runtime.log.stdout logs

After update to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3r, you might see logs in the content-library-runtime.log.stdout file to grow quickly and cause space shortage in the

drive of your vCenter Server installation. As a result, vpxd.cfg might not function properly and the vpxd service cannot start, which makes vCenter Server

unresponsive.

The issue is resolved in this release.

vSAN Issues

You cannot change the vSAN storage policy of powered-on virtual machines

If a powered-on VM has a virtual IDE controller, the hostd service prevents any changes to the device on that controller, including changes in the vSAN storage

policy. As a result, when you try to change the storage policy of such a VM, the operations fails with a message in the vSphere Client such as:

The attempted operation cannot be performed in the current state ("Powered on").

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that powered-on VM with an IDE disk can be reconfigured with a new storage policy.

vMotion Issues

After a migration operation, Windows 10 virtual machines might fail with a blue diagnostic screen and reports for a microcode revision mismatch

After a migration operation, Windows 10 virtual machines might fail with a blue diagnostic screen and report a microcode revision mismatch error such as:-

MICROCODE_REVISION_MISMATCH (17e)

The issue occurs when a scan of the CPUs runs during the migration operation and the firmware of the source CPUs does not match with the firmware of the

destination CPUs.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Security Issues

cURL is updated to version 7.84.0.

The Apache Tomcat server is updated to version 8.5.81.

The XStream library is updated to version 1.4.19.

The OpenSSL library is updated to version openssl- 1.0.2zf.

The Expat XML parser is updated to version 2.4.8.

The Sqlite database is updated to version 3.39.0.

Jackson is updated to version 2.12.7/2.13.2.

Jackson-databind is updated to version 2.12.7/2.13.2.2.

Eclipse Jetty is updated to version 9.4.48.v20220622.

The struts2-core library is updated to version 6.0.0.

The Oracle (Sun) JRE and JDK package is updated to version 1.8.0.341.

Networking Issues

VM clone fails with an error and newly created dvPort remains in vCenter Server database

If a virtual machine clone spec has the guestinfo.resync.mac.addr key in the extraConfig elements, such as the following:

<ovf:Info>Virtual hardware requirements</ovf:Info><vmw:ExtraConfig vmw:key="guestinfo.resync.mac.addr"/>, a cloning operation might fail, because in some cases, a

value for the key might not pass and remain unset. In the vpxd logs, you see with an error such as vmodl.fault.InvalidArgument and error messages like "A

specified parameter was not correct: config.extraConfig["guestinfo.resync.mac.addr"]". As a result, the newly created dvPort for the failed clone remains unused

in the vCenter Server database.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure to remove unused dvPort from the vCenter Server database. If the error persists, you must remove the

guestinfo.resync.mac.addr key in the extraConfig elements or set a valid MAC address as value.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

vMotion Issues

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

vMotion Issues

You see false alerts that a virtual machine is removed from the inventory while it is migrated

In rare cases, in the VM events reporting you might see an event Migrating off host followed by a VM removed event during a migration operation between ESXi

hosts. As a result, if you use a monitoring tool for vCenter alerts, you might see false alerts that the VM is removed from the inventory, while it is just migrated.

Workaround: None

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

You see error messages for failed protocol updates after a TLS reconfiguration or update operation

After you complete a TLS reconfiguration or update to a supported TLS version by using the TLS Configuration utility, when scanning vCenter Server TLS

endpoints, you might see an error messages such as:

Service vmcam with endpoint ('localhost', 7476), was not configured correctly to the requested protocol(s) and The update to protocol(s) failed at the end of

the console output. However, these messages do not indicate an issue with the TLS reconfiguration or update and the task completes correctly.

Workaround: Repeat the TLS scan to display the correct output with all services updated. To verify the TLS versions are updated properly, scan enabled TLS

versions by using the TLS Configuration utility as described in Enable or Disable TLS Versions on vCenter Server Systems.

For more information, see VMware knowledge base article Managing TLS protocol configuration for vSphere 6.5/6.7.

Product Support Notices

Starting with vSphere 7.0 Update 3i, when you configure the reverse proxy on the vCenter Server system to enable smart card authentication, you must use port

3128, which is set and opened automatically, but you must be permitted access to the port on the respective vCenter Server. Check your perimeter firewalls to

ensure that access has been granted. Make sure you restart the STS service after you configure the rhttpproxy service.

For more information, see Configure the Reverse Proxy to Request Client Certificates and VMware knowledge base articles 78057 and 90542.

CIM and API Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

Miscellaneous Issues

Networking Issues

Security Issues

vSAN Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

Server Configuration Issues

Hardware labels for Dynamic DirectPath I/O devices do not persist across ESXi host reboots

Hardware labels assigned to Dynamic DirectPath I/O devices in a vCenter Server system might not persist across reboots of the ESXi hosts. As a result, you must

assign a hardware label after each reboot.

This issue is resolved in this release.

ESXi hosts intermittently become unresponsive to vCenter Server

In rare cases, when the password of a vpxuser is not in sync with the password maintained by the vpxd service or is expired, ESXi hosts might become

unresponsive to vCenter Server.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You might see false vCenter Server alarms for a failed email delivery

If a task for sending emails from vCenter Server times out, you might see a false alarm with a message such as cannot send email to although the email is sent

successfully.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix increases the timeout for the sendmail task.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

VM power on fails admission check at an ESXi host with the error InsufficientMemoryResourcesFault

If some virtual machines in a resource pool have a memory demand exceeding the configured memory reservation of an ESXi host, DRS might pass incorrect

resource pool reservation settings to the host. As a result, the power on of such VMs fails admission check in the ESXi host.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Removing a virtual TPM device during a VM clone operation might cause the task to fail

If you clone a VM with a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) and add a VirtualDeviceSpec::remove of the vTPM device in CloneSpec.location.deviceChange or

CloneSpec.config.deviceChange, the ESXi host throws an exception such as The virtual machine is configured to require encryption. The removal of the vTPM might

cause the clone operation to fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Storage DRS operations with virtual machines fail with an error: The available storage IOPs capacity is not sufficient for the operation

If some VMs in a storage cluster have storage I/O reservations, vSphere Storage DRS might fail to balance the storage cluster and throw an error such as The

available storage IOPs capacity is not sufficient for the operation.

This issue is resolved in this release. The manual workaround is to set the vSphere Storage DRS advanced option EnforceIOReservations to 0.

In the vSphere Client, if you remove a vTPM device from a VM or VM template during a clone operation, cloning might fail

In the vSphere Client, when you clone a VM or a VM template with a vTPM device, if you remove the device for the target VM or template at the hardware

customization step, the clone operation might fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You cannot put ESXi hosts with vSphere Cluster Services (vCLS) virtual machines in Maintenance Mode

Even users who are part of the Administrators SSO group might not be able put ESXi hosts with vCLS VMs in Maintenance Mode, because vCenter Server by

default treats vCLS VMs as system VMs and prevents any configuration or operations on the vCLS VMs. For example, if you have vCLS VMs created on a vSAN

datastore, the vCLS VM get vSAN encryption and VMs cannot be put in maintenance mode unless the vCLS admin role has explicit migrate permissions for

encrypted VMs.

This issue is resolved in this release.

An unhandled exception when posting a vCLS health event might cause the vpxd service to fail

An unhandled exception when posting a vCLS health event might cause the vpxd service to fail with an error such as Vmacore::System::SignalTerminateHandler

(info=info@entry=0x0, ctx=ctx@entry=0x0).

This issue is resolved in this release.

CIM and API Issues

A PbmCheckCompliance PBM API call invoked with a public SDK client fails with a deserialization error

For entities provisioned in a vSAN datastore, the PbmCheckCompliance PBM API call invoked with a public SDK client returns VsanComplianceResult type in the result.

VsanComplianceResult is an internal type that is not defined in the public PBM SDK. As a result, the public client does not recognize the type VsanComplianceResult

while deserializing the API result and throws a deserialization error.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

When you use a vSphere Lifecycle Manager baseline based on a rollup bulletin customized with the VMware Image Builder, remediation of ESXi hosts might

fail with an unknown error

In certain cases, when you use a vSphere Lifecycle Manager baseline based on an Image Builder-customized rollup bulletin to remediate ESXi hosts, in the

vSphere Client you might see an error such as VMware vSphere Lifecycle Manager had an unknown error. Check the events and log files for details.. In the

esxupdate.log file on impacted hosts, you see an error such as This upgrade transaction would skip ESXi Base Image VIB(s) VMware_bootbank_esx-ui_,

VMware_locker_tools-light_, which could cause failures post upgrade. . The issue occurs due to a recently added upgrade completeness check in the rollup

upgrade code path to prevent partial upgrades. This check might conflict with some workflows where Image Builder is used to remove some VIBs, such as the

VM Tools (tools-light) VIB.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix allows the removal of the vSphere Client (esx-ui) and VM Tools (tools-light) VIBs for remediations with a vSphere

Lifecycle Manager baseline based on an Image Builder-customized rollup bulletin. However, if you need to remove other VIBs, you must create a customized ISO

in Image Builder and use an upgrade baseline based on that ISO to perform the upgrade.

Miscellaneous Issues

vCenter Server might run out of storage space due to access logs accumulated under /var/log/vmware/vmware-sps

The vmware-sps service might generate access log files that do not automatically clean up. Depending on the usage of the service, such logs might cause

vCenter Server to run out of log storage.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server becomes unresponsive because /storage/log and /storage/core volumes fill up

Due to a rare race condition, a vCenter Server might continue attempts to access a session that is already closed. As a result, the /storage/log and /storage/core

volumes fill up and might cause the vCenter Server to become unresponsive.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You do not see the button to add permissions to objects in the vSphere Client until you refresh the screen

In the vSphere Client, when you navigate to Home > Inventory > Permissions, you might not see the button to add a permission until you refresh the screen. In

rare cases, the button is not active after a screen refresh.

This issue is resolved in this release.

In very rare cases, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) tasks might fail in result of intermittent vCenter Server unresponsiveness

Rarely, as VM events that potentially lead to a bad state accrue, this could lead to a VM misconfiguration and in very rare cases, to a missing VM layout. As a

result, vCenter Server might become intermittently unresponsive when querying the database for a VM layout that does not exist. In such cases, VDI tasks might

also fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Downloading small files over NFC stops or fails intermittently

If your vSphere system is busy with multiple calls to connect to ESX hosts to download files from datastores by using NFC, many attempts to retry a delayed or

failed call might accumulate unnecessary load of datastore refresh operations. As a result, NFC performance aggravates and downloading small files might stop

or fail intermittently.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix reduces unnecessary load of datastore refresh operations.

vSphere vMotion operations across Resource Pools might fail with insufficient resource error

vSphere vMotion operations across Resource Pools might fail with insufficient resource error. The issue affects mostly VMware Cloud Director.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Networking Issues

GET VM REST API fails with an internal server error

When you use a REST API function such as /rest/vcenter/vm/{vm-id}, the call might fail with an error message such as Internal server error: Error: Http error

500 while requesting '/rest/vcenter/vm/vm-xx’.

The issue occurs because the networkBootProtocol value might not persist in the vCenter Server database after reconfiguring the VM. As a result, when vCenter

Server restarts, the networkBootProtocol value is not available and the function /rest/vcenter/vm/{vm-id} fails.

The issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that the fixed now and the networkBootProtocol value persists in the vCenter Server database after a VM

reconfigure and vCenter Server restart.

In vSphere environments with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) installed, the vpxd service might become unresponsive

In vSphere environments with ACI installed, the vpxd service might not properly handle ESXi host local ports and become unresponsive. In the vpxd.log, you see

errors such as: ODBC error: (22003) - ERROR: numeric field overflow;.

This issue is resolved in this release.

VM clone fails with an error and newly created dvPort remains in vCenter Server database

If a virtual machine clone spec has the guestinfo.resync.mac.addr key in the extraConfig elements, such as the following:

<ovf:Info>Virtual hardware requirements</ovf:Info><vmw:ExtraConfig vmw:key="guestinfo.resync.mac.addr"/>, a cloning operation might fail, because in some cases, a

value for the key might not pass and remain unset. In the vpxd logs, you see with an error such as vmodl.fault.InvalidArgument and error messages like such as A

specified parameter was not correct: config.extraConfig["guestinfo.resync.mac.addr. As a result, the newly created dvPort for the failed clone remains unused in

the vCenter Server database.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure to remove unused dvPort from the vCenter Server database. If the error persists, you must remove

the guestinfo.resync.mac.addr key in the extraConfig elements or set a valid MAC address as value.

A link aggregation group (LAG) might intermittently go down and up when a vSphere Distributed Switch uplink removal

After a removal of a free VDS uplink, a LAG might go down and up in a short time. As a result, virtual machines that use that LAG as uplink might lose network

connectivity.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You might see delayed response from vCenter Server due to insufficient HTTP2 write buffer

In busy environments, vCenter Server might delay response to tasks due to insufficient HTTP2 write buffer.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The rhttpproxy service occasionally fails with a coredump reporting a buffer overflow

When the rhttpproxy service performs multiple operations on incoming URIs, it might miscalculate the buffer offset of each connection, which potentially leads to

errors such as buffer overflows and negative reads. As a result, the service fails.

This issue is resolved in this release.

If applications in your vSphere environment produce HTTP headers larger than 60 KiB, vCenter Server tasks might fail

In rare cases, HTTP headers from applications in your vSphere environment might exceed the limit of 60 KiB. As a result, vCenter Server tasks such as editing

vSphere DRS settings might fail with an error similar to: Error Loading Data - An error occurred while trying to load data. This could be due to temporary outage.

You can retry the operation by clicking retry button.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix extends the max configurable limit for HTTP headers to 96 KiB. You can add the following parameter to your

config.xml file: <maxRequestHeadersKb>96</maxRequestHeadersKb>

In pure IPv6 environments vCenter Server might experience intermittent network connectivity issues

vCenter Server might experience intermittent network connectivity issues in a pure IPv6 environment due to reaching the internal retry limit when attempting to

connect to a system service listening only on IPv6.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSAN Issues

You see a black screen during network setting configuration of a vSAN cluster

In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface, when you edit the settings of a selected network adaptor, the Edit settings screen might appear black. A similar

issue occurs in the vSphere Client when you try to edit the settings of a distributed switch in the Advanced Options screen under the Cluster Quickstart

configuration wizard.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You see vSAN health warnings such as Unable to fetch key provider details on host.{causeMessage}

If your system has vSAN encryption with a vSphere Native Key Provider, you might see vSAN health warnings such as Unable to fetch key provider details on

host.{causeMessage}, because the data-at-rest encryption alarm might use an old API.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

You cannot install an extension VIB of version earlier than the vCenter Server version by using a vSphere Lifecycle Manager workflow

If you upload an extension VIB of version earlier than the vCenter Server version, for example 7.0 to 7.0 Update 2, in the vSphere Lifecycle Manager depot, the

VIB appears as non-compliant during a pre-upgrade scan, as expected. However, if the vSphere Lifecycle Manager restarts for some reason before you install

the VIB, it displays as compliant. As a result, when you run an upgrade, the VIB is not installed.

This issue is resolved in this release.
