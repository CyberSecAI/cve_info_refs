## CVE-2022-31698 Analysis

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31698:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**
   - This is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability affecting the Content Library service in VMware vCenter Server.
   - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP header.
   - A large integer value in the `TokenParts` header causes excessive iteration and memory allocation, leading to high memory and CPU usage.

**2. Root Cause:**
   - The vulnerability lies within the `parseSecurityHeader` function, specifically how it handles the `TokenParts` HTTP header.
   - The function parses the integer value of `TokenParts` and uses it to create an array and iterate through a loop, without proper validation.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **CWE-834: Excessive Iteration:** The code uses a user-controlled value from the `TokenParts` header to determine loop iterations, leading to the potential for excessive iterations.
   - **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The code allocates an array based on the value of `TokenParts` without proper bounds checking, which can lead to excessive memory usage.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - A successful attack results in a denial of service.
   - The vCenter Server becomes unresponsive due to high memory and CPU usage.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/cls/resourcebundle/*` handler.
   - The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a large integer in the `TokenParts` header and a dummy `TokenPart` header.
    
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs network access to port 443 on the vCenter Server.
   - No authentication is required (pre-authentication vulnerability).

**7. Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerability is located in the `SsoOverRestVerifierUtil.java` file.
   - The `parseSecurityHeader` function reads the `TokenParts` header, converts it to an integer, and creates an array using that integer.
   - The code then iterates a loop, and populates the array by reading the `TokenPart` + i headers.
   - The code does not limit the `TokenParts` header value or handle potential negative or exceptionally large integer values.

**8. Affected Versions:**
   - VMware vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3t
   - VMware vCenter Server 6.7
   - VMware vCenter Server 7.0
   - VMware Cloud Foundation (vCenter Server) 3.x and 4.x
 
**9. Fix:**
   - Patches for affected versions are available in vCenter Server 6.5 U3u, 6.7 U3s, and 7.0 U3i.

**10. Additional Notes:**
   - The vulnerability was discovered by Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos.
   - VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the Moderate severity range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 5.8.

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-31698 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in VMware vCenter Server that can be exploited by sending a malicious HTTP request with a large integer value in the `TokenParts` header. This triggers excessive iteration and memory allocation within the `parseSecurityHeader` function, leading to high resource consumption and server unresponsiveness. The vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires only network access to the affected vCenter Server. Patches are available to remediate this issue.
