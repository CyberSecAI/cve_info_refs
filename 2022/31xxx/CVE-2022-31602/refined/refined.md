- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `IpSecDxe` component of the SBIOS firmware. This occurs when a user with elevated privileges has preconditioned the heap.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, denial of service, data integrity impact, and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. The attacker needs elevated privileges and must precondition the heap to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs local access with high privileges and must have the ability to precondition the heap in a specific way to exploit the vulnerability.
