# Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution') in underscore.deep

High

[mcab](/mcab)
published
GHSA-8j79-hfj5-f2xm
Jun 28, 2022

## Package

npm

underscore.deep
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<0.5.2

## Patched versions

0.5.3

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

`underscore.deep` is vulnerable to prototype pollution.

An attacker can craft a malicious payload and pass it to `deepFromFlat`, which would pollute any future Objects created.

Any users that have `deepFromFlat` or `deepPick` (due to its dependency on `deepFromFlat`) in their code should upgrade.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

This is patched in 0.5.3. Users should upgrade to 0.5.3.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Modifying `deepFromFlat` to prevent specific keywords will prevent this from happening.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, feel free to open an issue in [Clever/underscore.deep](https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep). This was triaged in <https://huntr.dev/bounties/23204932-72b2-419d-b5f0-34a130752d82/>.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31106

### Weaknesses

[CWE-1321](/advisories?query=cwe%3A1321)
