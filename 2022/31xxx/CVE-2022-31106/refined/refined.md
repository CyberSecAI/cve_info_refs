The content is related to CVE-2022-31106.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of object properties within the `deepFromFlat` function of the `underscore.deep` library. Specifically, it fails to prevent the modification of the Object prototype attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution vulnerability, allows an attacker to modify the prototype of Object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious payload and pass it to the `deepFromFlat` function to pollute the prototype of the Object. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the application as all objects will inherit the polluted properties, potentially leading to denial of service, or other unexpected behaviors.
- The `deepPick` function is also vulnerable because it relies on `deepFromFlat`.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker provides a malicious payload as input to the `deepFromFlat` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to control the input passed to the `deepFromFlat` function.
