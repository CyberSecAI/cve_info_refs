**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the username, when handling private chat messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize usernames before displaying them in chat messages.
- The use of `innerHTML` or similar methods likely contributed to the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the chat interface.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Adding an administrator account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the private chat feature of BigBlueButton.
- An attacker joins a room with a crafted username containing an XSS payload.
- When the attacker sends a private message to a victim, the malicious JavaScript embedded within the username is executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to join a BigBlueButton meeting with a malicious username.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send private messages to other users.
- No specific user interaction is required from the victim, beyond being present in the same meeting and receiving a private message.
