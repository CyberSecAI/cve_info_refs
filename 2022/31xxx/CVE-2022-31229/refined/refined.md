- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an error message in Dell PowerScale OneFS that exposes sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system reveals sensitive information through error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, which can then be used to access sensitive resources.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based and can be exploited by an attacker with low privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have administrator level privileges in the affected system to exploit this vulnerability, according to the description. This is a network-based attack, so the attacker must be able to communicate with the system through a network.
