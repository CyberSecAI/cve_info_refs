{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `ecdsa_ptr` (signature builtin pointer) was being allocated as a local variable within the `execute` function of the Account library, rather than being passed as an implicit argument. The signature hint was pointing to this local reference, which is not the correct memory segment for signature verification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of the signature builtin pointer",
      "Lack of proper implicit argument passing for cryptographic operations"
    ],
    "impact": "Transactions on Goerli network using accounts from cairo-contracts v0.2.0 would fail with an 'invalid signature' error, rendering the accounts unusable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a transaction to an affected account on the Goerli network"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a transaction to an affected account on the Goerli network.",
   "additional_details": "The issue was not present in the StarkNet test environment or the devnet because they handle the signature builtin differently. The fix involves passing the `ecdsa_ptr` as an implicit argument to the `execute`, `eth_execute`, and `_unsafe_execute` functions in the Account library, and the `__execute__` function in the EthAccount."
