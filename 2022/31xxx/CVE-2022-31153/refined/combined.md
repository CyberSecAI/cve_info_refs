# Account cannot process transactions on Goerli

Critical

[martriay](/martriay)
published
GHSA-8mjr-jr5h-q2xr
Jul 14, 2022

## Package

cairo-contracts
(Cairo)

## Affected versions

v0.2.0

## Patched versions

v0.2.1

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability affects all accounts (vanilla and ethereum flavors) in the [v0.2.0 release of OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.2.0), which are not whitelisted on StarkNet mainnet, so only goerli deployments of v0.2.0 accounts are affected.

This faulty behavior is not observed in [StarkNet's testing framework](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/testing/starknet.py), so don't rely on it passing to detect this issue on custom accounts.

### Patches

This bug has been patched in [v0.2.1](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.2.1).

### References

The issue is detailed in [#386](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/386).

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the Contracts for Cairo repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/new/choose)
* Email us at security@openzeppelin.com

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31153

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

## Description

![@andrew-fleming](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69282788?u=e5a0a9911850fda97f535ac600e9bda52a32bc72&v=4&size=48)[andrew-fleming](https://github.com/andrew-fleming)opened [on Jul 10, 2022](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/386#issue-1299789749)

Transactions on goerli fail with the following error message:

```
🛑 The transaction was rejected but no contract address was identified in the error message.
Error message:
Error at pc=0:133:
Got an exception while executing a hint.
Cairo traceback (most recent call last):
Unknown location (pc=0:746)
Unknown location (pc=0:682)
Error message: Account: invalid signature
Unknown location (pc=0:347)
Unknown location (pc=0:321)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<hint14>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/app/src/starkware/starknet/services/batcher/starknet_batcher_venv-site/starkware/cairo/lang/builtins/signature/signature_builtin_runner.py", line 94, in add_signature
    ), f"Signature hint must point to the signature builtin segment, not {addr}."
AssertionError: Signature hint must point to the signature builtin segment, not 14:0.

```

Neither the StarkNet test environment nor the devnet raise this error.

The error stems from here:

<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/release-0.2.0/src/openzeppelin/account/library.cairo#L203>

```
let (local ecdsa_ptr : SignatureBuiltin*) = alloc()

```

The Signature hint points to this reference (which the [SignatureBuiltinRunner](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/cairo/lang/builtins/signature/signature_builtin_runner.py#L85-L95) does not like). To resolve this, I suggest adding the `ecdsa_ptr: SignatureBuiltin*` as an implicit arg to `execute`, `eth_execute`, and `_unsafe_execute` in the Account library and EthAccount's `__execute__` as well.

Another solution would be to isolate the functionality of both accounts (thus removing `_unsafe_execute`), so we don't have to pass the implicit `ecdsa_ptr` in the EthAccount methods.

|  |  | ### MockEthSigner utility |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The `MockEthSigner` class in [utils.py](../tests/utils.py) is used to perform transactions on a given Account with a secp256k1 curve key pair, crafting the transaction and managing nonces. It differs from the `MockSigner` implementation by: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* not using the public key but its derived address instead (the last 20 bytes of the keccak256 hash of the public key and adding `0x` to the beginning) |
|  |  | \* signing the message with a secp256k1 curve address |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Account entrypoint |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | `\_\_execute\_\_` acts as a single entrypoint for all user interaction with any contract, including managing the account contract itself. That's why if you want to change the public key controlling the Account, you would send a transaction targeting the very Account contract: |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | Returns `TRUE` if a given signature in the secp256k1 curve is valid, otherwise it reverts. In the future it will return `FALSE` if a given signature is invalid (for more info please check [this issue](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/327)). |

|  |  | ### `\_unsafe\_execute` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | It's an internal method that performs the following tasks: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 1. Increments the nonce. |
|  |  | 2. Takes the input and builds a `Call` for each iterated message. See [Multicall transactions](#multicall-transactions) for more information. |
|  |  | 3. Calls the target contract with the intended function selector and calldata parameters |
|  |  | 4. Forwards the contract call response data as return value |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Presets |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The following contract presets are ready to deploy and can be used as-is for quick prototyping and testing. Each preset differs on the signature type being used by the Account. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Account |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The [`Account`](../src/openzeppelin/account/Account.cairo) preset uses StarkNet keys to validate transactions. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Eth Account |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The [`EthAccount`](../src/openzeppelin/account/EthAccount.cairo) preset supports Ethereum addresses, validating transactions with secp256k1 keys. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Account differentiation with ERC165 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Certain contracts like ERC721 require a means to differentiate between account contracts and non-account contracts. For a contract to declare itself as an account, it should implement [ERC165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) as proposed in [#100](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/discussions/100). To be in compliance with ERC165 specifications, the idea is to calculate the XOR of `IAccount`'s EVM selectors (not StarkNet selectors). The resulting magic value of `IAccount` is 0x50b70dcb. |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Extending the Account contract |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Account contracts can be extended by following the [extensibility pattern](../docs/Extensibility.md#the-pattern). The basic idea behind integrating the pattern is to import the requisite methods from the Account library and incorporate the extended logic thereafter. |
|  |  | Account contracts can be extended by following the [extensibility pattern](../docs/Extensibility.md#the-pattern). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To implement custom account contracts, a pair of `validate` and `execute` functions should be exposed. This is why the Account library comes with different flavors of such pairs, like the vanilla `is\_valid\_signature` and `execute`, or the Ethereum flavored `is\_valid\_eth\_signature` and `eth\_execute` pair. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Account contract developers are encouraged to implement the [standard Account interface](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/discussions/41) and incorporate the custom logic thereafter. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To implement alternative `execute` functions, make sure to check their corresponding `validate` function before calling the `\_unsafe\_execute` building block, as each of the current presets is doing. Do not expose `\_unsafe\_execute` directly. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Currently, there's only a single library/preset Account scheme, but we're looking for feedback and new presets to emerge. Some new validation schemes to look out for in the future: |

Resolves [#386](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/386).

This proposed Account change will yield an artifact upon compilation that should be added to Nile to address [issue 143.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/143)

This was passing before, but with the proposed changes, the nonce's `0 - 1` is out of range for a valid signature, which in turn, returns a different error. This is similar to what happened here:

> Why is the ecdsa\_ptr implicit argument required in unsafe\_execute ?

Compilation without the `ecdsa_ptr` in `_unsafe_execute` fails:

```
E               starkware.cairo.lang.compiler.preprocessor.preprocessor_error.PreprocessorError: /Users/andrewfleming/Documents/starknet/cairo-contracts/cairo-contracts/.tox/default/lib/python3.7/site-packages/openzeppelin/account/library.cairo:211:9: Cannot convert the implicit arguments of _unsafe_execute to the implicit arguments of execute.
E                       return _unsafe_execute(call_array_len, call_array, calldata_len, calldata, nonce)

E                   func _unsafe_execute{

E                   func execute{
E                                ^

```

`_unsafe_execute` makes the actual contract call and seems to require passing the sig builtin for verification:

<https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/cairo/lang/builtins/signature/signature_builtin_runner.py#L12-L18>

I'm still trying to understand this issue.

And what if we explicitly pass the implicit arguments without including ecdsa\_ptr? It looks like it's trying to pass along all the available implicit arguments including those that aren't needed.

If I understand you question correctly, I don't think this works. Taking out the implicit `ecdsa_ptr` means we'll still need to create some reference to it to validate the signature...which brings us back to the same initial issue: `Signature hint must point to the signature builtin segment, not {addr}`.

My suggestion was to write the call as

```
_unsafe_execute{syscall_ptr, pedersen_ptr, etc...}(call_array_len, call_array, calldata_len, calldata, nonce)

```

(I'm not sure if this works)

Afaict the implicit arguments are not only received by `_unsafe_execute` but also passed to the next function call, doing so could revoke `ecdsa_ptr` but other than that it might work.

| Nothing of notice. I was just playing around with `starknet-hardhat-plugin` and did not understand why things are not working until I hit this error. Thought it was lack of funding of the accounts at first .. Fortunately its just testnet tokens 😉 |
