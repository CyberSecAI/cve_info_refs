Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Valinor library automatically including the full exception message from user-land exceptions in its mapping error messages. This behavior unintentionally exposes sensitive information contained within exception messages, which could lead to data exfiltration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the exposure of potentially sensitive information from exceptions. This includes details like SQL snippets, database connection details (IP address, username, password), and timeout/out-of-memory details, which can aid attackers in further attacks.
*   **Lack of Sanitization/Filtering:** The library did not initially filter or sanitize user-land exception messages before including them in error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could potentially extract sensitive data from error messages.
*   **DDoS/Enumeration Attacks:** Exposed timeout details or connection information could aid in DDoS or enumeration attacks.
*   **Broader Security Risks:** The disclosure of database credentials could lead to a full compromise of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves crafting input data that triggers exceptions within the user-defined constructors or mapping processes handled by the Valinor library. Specifically, it exploits the library's default behavior of including exception details in error messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to provide input to the Valinor library that would cause exceptions to be thrown by user-defined code.
*   The attacker would need to observe/access the error messages generated by the Valinor library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as "low" severity by the reporter.
*   The fix involves introducing a new method `MapperBuilder::filterExceptions()` that allows developers to filter exceptions and to explicitly define which ones should be included as safe messages.
*   The advisory explicitly mentions that exceptions in a constructor are no longer automatically caught by the mapper.
* The fix prevents messages with sensitive information from reaching the final user.
* The advisory provides code example demonstrating the usage of `filterExceptions()` method.
