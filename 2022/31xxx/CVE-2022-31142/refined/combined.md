# Potential Timing Attack Vector in fastify-bearer-auth

High

[mcollina](/mcollina)
published
GHSA-376v-xgjx-7mfr
Jul 14, 2022

## Package

npm

@fastify/bearer-auth
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 8.0.0

## Patched versions

>= v7.0.2 < v8.0.0 and > v8.0.0

## Description

### Impact

fastify-bearer-auth does not securely use crypto.timingSafeEqual. A malicious attacker could estimate the length of one valid bearer token. According to the corresponding RFC 6750, the bearer token has only base64 valid characters, reducing the range of characters for a brute force attack.

All versions of fastify-bearer-auth are also affected.

### Patches

We released:

* v8.0.1 with a fix for the Fastify v4 line
* v7.0.2 with a fix for the Fastify v3 line

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds. Update your dependencies.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31142
