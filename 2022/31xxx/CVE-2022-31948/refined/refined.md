The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Rescue Dispatch Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter when deleting a report. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `/rdms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_report` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection: The application directly uses user-supplied input within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Extract sensitive information from the database. In the provided example, the attacker extracts the database name using `select database()`.
- Modify or delete data in the database.
- Potentially gain further access to the system depending on database permissions and other application vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed via an HTTP POST request to `/rdms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_report`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`, which is passed within the body of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not appear to require prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability, as the provided payload includes only a basic `PHPSESSID` cookie.
