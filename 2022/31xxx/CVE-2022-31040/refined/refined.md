Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The cookie consent page in Open Forms was vulnerable to an open redirect. This occurred because the application was injecting a `referer` query string parameter without properly validating its value, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Open Redirect:** The application failed to validate the `referer` parameter, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application did not sanitize or validate the `referer` parameter before using it for redirection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** A malicious actor could redirect users to a website under their control, potentially leading to phishing attacks where users might be tricked into entering sensitive information.
- **Reputation Damage:** The legitimate backend of the application initiating the redirect makes it less obvious to users that they are being redirected to a malicious website which can cause reputational damage to the software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the network.
- An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing a `referer` parameter pointing to a malicious site.
- The user would need to click on the link or be redirected from the legitimate page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the vulnerable `referer` parameter.
- The attacker can be remote.
- No special privileges are required.
- User interaction is required, as a user needs to follow the crafted link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the cookie consent page of Open Forms.
- The application uses both the `referer` header and the `referer` parameter in the URL.
- The vulnerability is fixed by validating the `referer` parameter against allowed hosts defined in the settings and CORS configurations.
- The fix involves the addition of a `get_allowed_redirect_url` template tag and changes to the `allow_redirect_url` function in `utils/redirect.py` to check against a list of allowed hosts and CORS configurations.
