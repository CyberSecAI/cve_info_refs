# URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in open-forms

High

[sergei-maertens](/sergei-maertens)
published
GHSA-c97h-m5qf-j8mf
Jun 13, 2022

## Package

open-forms
(open-formulieren)

## Affected versions

< 1.0.9, < 1.1.1

## Patched versions

1.0.9, 1.1.1

## Description

### Impact

The cookie consent page in Open Forms contains an open redirect by injecting a `referer` querystring parameter and failing to validate the value. A malicious actor is able to redirect users to a website under their control, opening them up for phishing attacks. The redirect is initiated by the open forms backend which is a legimate page, making it less obvious to end users they are being redirected to a malicious website.

### Patches

Patches will be provided in the `master` branch and the upcoming releases for supported versions: `1.0.9` and `1.1.1`.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround available.

### For more information

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID
