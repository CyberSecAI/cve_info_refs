- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An uncontrolled search path vulnerability exists in all NVIDIA GeForce Experience client installers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The installer loads DLLs without properly validating their location, allowing an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL that will be loaded by the installer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution on the targeted system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with user-level privileges can place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it from.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs user-level privileges and must be able to place a malicious DLL where the installer will load it from. The user needs to launch the installer to trigger the vulnerability.
