Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-31038:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `DisplayName` field for users in Gogs was not sanitized, allowing users to input arbitrary characters, including malicious scripts. When this unsanitized `DisplayName` was directly displayed in the issue list, it led to an XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application failed to sanitize user-provided data, specifically the `DisplayName`, before rendering it in the issue list, making it vulnerable to stored XSS attacks.
- Improper Input Handling: The system did not properly validate or sanitize user input, allowing for potentially harmful data to be stored and displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's `DisplayName`.
- When other users viewed the issue list, the malicious script would execute in their browsers, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Theft of sensitive information.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Defacement of the application.
    - Other browser-based attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with a user account would change their `DisplayName` to include malicious JavaScript.
- The vulnerability is triggered when other users view the issue list which displays the malicious `DisplayName`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the Gogs instance.
- The attacker needs the ability to modify their own `DisplayName`.
- No special privileges are required beyond a normal user.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved sanitizing the `DisplayName` before it is displayed in the issue list.
- The fix was implemented in version 0.12.9.
- The pull request #7009 addresses this vulnerability, and the fix was implemented by replacing `{{$.i18n.Tr "repo.issues.opened_by" $timeStr .Poster.HomeLink .Poster.DisplayName | Safe}}` with `{{$.i18n.Tr "repo.issues.opened_by" $timeStr .Poster.HomeLink .Poster.DisplayName | Sanitize | Safe}}` in the `list.tmpl` file.
