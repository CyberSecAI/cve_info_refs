- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the `nvlddmkm.sys` kernel mode layer handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Failure to properly validate data leads to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user with basic capabilities can trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker through the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs basic user capabilities on the local system.
