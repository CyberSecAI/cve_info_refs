# Octopoller gem published with world-writable files

Low

[nickfloyd](/nickfloyd)
published
GHSA-26qj-cr27-r5c4
Jun 15, 2022

## Package

bundler

octopoller
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

0.2.0

## Patched versions

0.3.0

## Description

### Impact

Version [0.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.2.0) of the octopoller gem was published containing world-writeable files. Specifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644).

This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem.

Malicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this package, could modify the gem’s files and change its behavior during runtime.

### Patches

* octopoller 0.3.0

### Workarounds

Users can use the previous version of the gem [v0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.1.0). Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31071

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

|  |  | <<'###SCRIPT\_COMMENT' |
|  |  | Purpose: |
|  |  | (Given octopoller.rb is currently shipped "manually") |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Because different environments behave differently, it is recommended that the integrity and file permissions of the files packed in the gem are verified. |
|  |  | This is to help prevent things like releasing world writeable files in the gem. The simple check below looks at each file contained in the packed gem and |
|  |  | verifies that the files are only owner writeable. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Requirements: |
|  |  | This script expects that script/package, script/release or 'gem build \*.gemspec' have been run |
