{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The muhttpd server does not properly sanitize or validate the requested file path, leading to path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal: The server skips the first character of the requested path without proper validation, allowing access to files outside the intended web root."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can download arbitrary files and gather sensitive information from the target device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTTP requests: By prepending an arbitrary character to the file path in the request, an attacker can traverse the file system."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "No authentication is required. If remote management is enabled, a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability. Otherwise, an attacker on the local network can exploit it."
  },
  "additional_details": {
       "affected_versions": "muhttpd versions 1.1.5 and earlier.",
        "sensitive_information_disclosure": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information including: usernames and passwords, WiFi SSIDs and passwords, ISP connection information, private keys, and more through accessing files like /etc/config.cfg, /etc/passwd, and others.",
        "encryption_weakness": "The device uses AES-128-CBC encryption for certain secrets, however the key generation is weak. The AES key is derived from a client certificate (which gets truncated due to the use of strlcpy) and other device-specific data, making it susceptible to brute-force and lookup table attacks.",

            {
            "name": "NULL pointer dereference",
            "description": "Injecting a NULL byte into the HTTP request stream causes a segmentation fault in a forked process due to improper parsing of the request protocol.",
             "impact":"Though this crashes a child process the main server continues to operate. Resource exhaustion and DoS may be possible with more research."
          },
             {
             "name": "Buffer over-read when defanging URLs",
            "description": "The server has a buffer over-read when handling percent-encoded values in the URL, specifically if a percent sign is not followed by two characters. This allows a read out of bounds into the HTTP protocol version string.",
             "impact":"This issue is not exploitable by itself but allows for single-level path traversal (../) with vulnerability 1. Fixing vulnerability 1 fixes the traversal issue, though not the over-read."
