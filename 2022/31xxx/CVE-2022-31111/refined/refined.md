{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The truncation done when converting between EVM balance type and Substrate balance type was incorrectly implemented.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect truncation of balance values during conversion between EVM and Substrate balance types.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Discrepancy between the displayed EVM transfer value and the actual Substrate value transferred. This can affect EVM contracts, including DEX and ERC20 tokens, that read EVM transfer values.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs through interaction with EVM contracts that rely on the balance conversions. Specifically, during EVM balance transfers or when EVM contracts read transfer values.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger transactions involving EVM balance transfers or interact with affected EVM contracts. No specific elevated privileges are required. The attacker would need to make calls to the affected contracts to trigger the incorrect conversion"
