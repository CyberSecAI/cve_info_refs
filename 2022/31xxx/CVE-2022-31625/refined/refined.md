{
  "CVE-2022-31625": {
    "Root cause": "An uninitialized array in the `pg_query_params()` function within the PHP pgsql extension leads to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Uninitialized memory",
      "Incorrect error handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. A lingering value from a previous request could get freed, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By passing values which are not coercible to string to the `$params` parameter of `pg_query_params()` or `pg_send_execute()`.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control the parameters passed to `pg_query_params` or `pg_send_execute` to include values that cannot be converted to strings. This could be through a web application that allows users to influence database queries."
