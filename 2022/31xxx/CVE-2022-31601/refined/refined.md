- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `SmbiosPei` component of the SBIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution, denial of service, compromised integrity, and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with high privileges can trigger the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access with high privileges on the system.
