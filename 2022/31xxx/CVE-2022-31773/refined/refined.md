- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM DataPower Gateway Web UI is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform actions on the DataPower Gateway Web UI by tricking an authenticated user into submitting malicious requests.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via the Web UI through a cross-site request forgery.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website to perform an action on the DataPower Gateway Web UI. They do not need direct access to the internal network, but rather rely on the authenticated user having access to the targeted web interface.
