Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Guzzle's `RedirectMiddleware` handles redirects. It failed to properly consider a change in port as a change in origin. This means that sensitive headers like `Authorization` and `Cookie` were not stripped when following a redirect to the same host but different port.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of redirects with port changes.
- Failure to remove sensitive headers (Authorization, Cookie) when redirecting to a different port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information, specifically `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers, to potentially unintended recipients. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can set up a malicious server that redirects requests to a different port of the original server, and because the client sends authorization information, the attacker can now see the auth information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the redirect target.
- The attacker needs to cause a request that will be redirected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves modifying the `RedirectMiddleware` to treat a change in port as a change in origin. This ensures that sensitive headers are stripped before following the redirect.
- The issue was addressed in Guzzle versions 6.5.8 and 7.4.5.
- This is a high severity issue because sensitive information like authorization information is exposed to an untrusted party
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-27776, which affects curl.
