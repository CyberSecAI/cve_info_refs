- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CODESYS V2 communication protocol transmits passwords unprotected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials: Passwords are sent in cleartext between communication clients and servers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can sniff network traffic and potentially obtain passwords, allowing unauthorized access to CODESYS Control runtime systems.
- **Attack vectors:** Network sniffing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to sniff network traffic between the communication clients (e.g., CODESYS Development System) and servers (CODESYS Control runtime systems).

The document provides more detail than the official CVE description by explaining the affected products and the vulnerable protocol. It also specifies that the passwords for protecting the communication servers of products like the CODESYS Control runtime system are transmitted unprotected and that this feature is vulnerable.
