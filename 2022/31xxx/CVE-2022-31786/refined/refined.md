{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the PATH_INFO component of the URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "A maliciously crafted URL containing the XSS payload in the PATH_INFO component. The victim needs to open this link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a URL containing a malicious script. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the server side. The victim needs to be tricked into opening the link."
