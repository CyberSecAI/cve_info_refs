The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Rescue Dispatch Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/rdms/admin/incidents/manage_incident.php` script, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization of the `id` parameter in the mentioned php script.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query, potentially allowing them to:
    * Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., database name, other tables content).
    * Modify or delete data.
    * Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
    * Sending a malicious HTTP GET request to `/rdms/admin/incidents/manage_incident.php` with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
    * No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability as the injection point exists in the `id` parameter of the request
