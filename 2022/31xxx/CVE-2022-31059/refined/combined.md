# Event names susceptible to XSS

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-c783-x9vm-xxp5
Jun 14, 2022

## Package

discourse-calendar
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 1.0.0

## Patched versions

stable >= 1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

Parsing and rendering of Event names can be susceptible to XSS attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourse’s default Content Security Policy.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the version of Discourse Calendar plugin.

### Workarounds

Ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.

### Severity

Moderate

6.5

# CVSS overall score

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID
