How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

We recently discovered a security vulnerability in our [BackupBuddy](https://solidwp.com/backupbuddy) plugin. The vulnerability could allow a breach of your WordPress site, so we are asking all customers toÂ **confirm your sites are running version 8.7.5 or higher of the BackupBuddy plugin.**

### BackupBuddy

Plugin:BackupBuddyVulnerability:Directory Traversal Vulnerability Patched in Version:8.7.5Severity Score:HighThe vulnerability has been patched, so you should update to version 8.7.5.
## Who This Vulnerability Impacts

This vulnerability only impacts sites **running BackupBuddy versions 8.5.8.0 through 8.7.4.1.**

**We have indications that this vulnerability is being *actively exploited* in the wild.** We were notified of suspicious activity related to a BackupBuddy installation on September 2nd, 2022. The earliest exploits we have discovered appear to have started on August 27th, 2022.

* Once we identified the exploit, we released a patch on September 2, 2022, to resolve the exploit in BackupBuddy version 8.7.5.
* **We have made this security update available to all vulnerable BackupBuddy versions (8.5.8 â 8.7.4.1), regardless of your current BackupBuddy licensing status, so no one continues to run a vulnerable version of the BackupBuddy plugin.**
* We also pushed auto-updates for all iThemes Sync users who have BackupBuddy installed.

## What Information Can Hackers Get Access To?

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to view the contents of any file on your server that can be read by your WordPress installation. This could include the WordPress `wp-config.php` file and, depending on your server setup, sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

## Indicators of Compromise

To detect if your site was attacked, look for the following indicators of compromise. Search your serverâs access logs for any text that contains `local-destination-id` and `/etc/passwd` or `wp-config.php` with an [HTTP 2xx Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses).Â (If you need help with this, please reach out to our support team by creating a support ticket on the [iThemes Help Desk](https://solidwp.com/support).)

## What You Should Do: Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Update BackupBuddy to version 8.7.5 immediately.

**Please update to BackupBuddy 8.7.5. immediately to fix this exploit.** Even if you arenât running one of the vulnerable versions of BackupBuddy, we still recommend updating to BackupBuddy 8.7.5 as a best practice for running the latest versions of all your plugins and themes.

Running BackupBuddy on multiple WordPress sites? Use [iThemes Sync](https://sync.ithemes.com) to quickly update all your sites to BackupBuddy 8.7.5.

### 2. Follow the steps in the previous section to search for a compromise.

If you have determined that your site may have been compromised, we recommend performing the following steps.

1. **Reset your database password.** You may have to reach out to your hosting provider to help you with this.
2. **Change your WordPress salts.** iThemes Security can do this for you automatically via Tools > Change WordPress Salts. You can update them manually following our guide on [how to change your WordPress salts and keys](https://solidwp.com/blog/easily-change-wordpress-security-keys-salts-ithemes-security-plugin/).
3. **Rotate other secrets in wp-config.php**. You may have stored API keys for services like Amazon S3 in your `wp-config.php` file. If so, these should be reset and updated.

If your server has an exposed phpMyAdmin installation, or your WordPress server connects to a publicly accessible database server, we recommend restoring to a backup from a date prior to the earliest logged access attempt. If this isnât possible, engage a Hack Repair service to help you manually clean your WordPress website. At a minimum, you should search for and remove any suspicious administrator users on your website and reset the passwords for all other administrator users.

### If you manage your own server

1. **Consider rotating SSH passwords for all users.** An attacker could brute force the hashed password in the file and possibly continue to gain further unauthorized access to your server.
2. **Consider updating your web userâs SSH keys.** An attacker could read the private SSH key file and the associated known hosts that the web user might have accessed previously.

Responsible disclosure and reporting of vulnerabilities is an integral part of keeping the WordPress community safe.Â **Please share this post with your friends to help get the word out and make WordPress safer for everyone**!
