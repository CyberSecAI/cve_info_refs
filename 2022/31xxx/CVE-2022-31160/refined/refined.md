  "CVE-2022-31160": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the jquery-UI package. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the initialization of a check-box-radio widget on an input tag enclosed within a label, leading to the parent label contents being considered as the input label.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises because when a checkboxradio widget is initialized on an input element that is nested within a label, the content of the parent label is incorrectly treated as the input label. When the `.checkboxradio('refresh')` method is called on such a widget, any HTML entities within the label are decoded, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could result in sensitive information disclosure, data modification, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious HTML code into the label associated with a checkbox or radio input element. When the checkboxradio widget is initialized and refreshed, this injected code gets executed.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the HTML content that gets rendered on the page, specifically the content within the label element. This could be achieved through various means, such as manipulating user input, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or compromising a system component."
