- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Dell PowerStore Manager GUI does not properly restrict the number of authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform password brute-forcing, potentially leading to account takeover if weak passwords are used.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by unauthenticated attackers via the PowerStore Manager GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the PowerStore Manager GUI remotely. No authentication or local access is initially required.
