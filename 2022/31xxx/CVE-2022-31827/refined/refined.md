```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `performFetchRequest` function in `HTTPFetcher.php` does not sufficiently validate the `source` parameter, leading to it being used in a `curl_setopt` call which results in an SSRF vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
    "Insufficient input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use the server to send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially probing internal network services or exfiltrating data from internal resources.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to `/application/api/api.php` with a crafted `request` parameter containing a malicious URL in the `source` field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, and have valid FTP/SFTP credentials. However, the provided details indicate that any FTP/SFTP login can pass the authentication. Therefore, it's considered a pre-authentication SSRF."
