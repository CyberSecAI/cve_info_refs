{
  "CVE-2022-31151": {
    "summary": "The `undici` package in Node.js versions prior to 5.7.1 is vulnerable to cookie leakage on cross-origin redirects. When a request with cookie headers is redirected to a different origin, these cookie headers are not cleared, potentially exposing sensitive information to third-party sites or malicious actors. This issue stems from uncleared cookie headers during cross-host/cross-origin redirects.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the failure to clear cookie headers during cross-origin redirects in the `undici` library, while authorization headers were already cleared.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is the potential leakage of sensitive cookie information to third-party sites or malicious actors. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts or other sensitive resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves an attacker controlling the redirection target, such as using an open redirector, to leak cookies to a third-party site. An attacker does not have to be physically near.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control or manipulate the redirection target, such as by using an open redirector on the vulnerable server. No privileges or user interaction is required."
