This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fixed Array.prototype.lastIndexOf() with unicode string as "this".

```
Previously, when lastIndexOf() was called with unicode string as "this"
argument and a negative "fromIndex" argument null-pointer dererence
might occur because njs_string_offset() was called with invalid index
value whereas njs_string_offset() should always be called with valid
index argument.

The fix is to verify that from index is valid.

This closes [#482](https://github.com/nginx/njs/issues/482) issue on Github.
