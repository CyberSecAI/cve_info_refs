Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-31290:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the improper use of `htmlspecialchars()` function within the Idno CMS. Instead of using it to validate user supplied input, the function was applied to pre-determined values fetched from a user profile or the system configuration. This makes the application vulnerable to stored XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to multiple stored XSS attacks due to the failure to sanitize user-supplied input before it is stored in the database and subsequently rendered on web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable input fields. When a user visits pages displaying this stored data, the injected script will execute in the user's browser, allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Deface the website.
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The stored XSS with admin privileges can be used to perform actions with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into input fields like user "name", and site settings like "site title" or "site description".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have an account on the system to inject malicious code through user settings. However, they do not need admin privileges to exploit some of the vulnerabilities.
*   **Admin Privileges** : For the XSS vulnerabilities that affect the entire site via site settings. The attacker must have admin privileges.

**Specific Vulnerable Code Locations:**

*   User "name" field.
*   "Site Title" input field in admin settings.
*   "Site Description" input field in admin settings.

**Additional Details:**
