Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the `CFG_GLPI` variable in the login error page. This variable contains sensitive configuration information about the GLPI instance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the unintentional disclosure of sensitive configuration data via the login error page when authentication fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** An attacker could gain access to configuration details such as:
    *   SMTP server settings
    *   CAS (Central Authentication Service) host information
    * potentially other internal system configurations.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** This information could be used to facilitate further attacks by revealing how the system operates or by leveraging exposed credentials if stored insecurely within the configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Page Error:** The vulnerability is triggered when an authentication failure occurs on the login page.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability; the attacker only needs to attempt a login with invalid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the GLPI instance.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability, only the ability to send HTTP requests to the login page.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.0.3 of GLPI.
*   The commit `e66a0df` addresses the issue by no longer displaying `CFG_GLPI` in the login error page, instead displaying the error message using a twig template.
*   The configuration values are exposed because they are embedded in javascript code using the `Html::getCoreVariablesForJavascript` function which is called even for non logged sessions.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-31143.
