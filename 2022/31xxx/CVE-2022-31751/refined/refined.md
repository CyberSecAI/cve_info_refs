Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-31751:

**Root Cause:** Multi-thread competition for resources in the kernel emcom module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  A race condition exists in the kernel's emcom module due to multiple threads competing for the same resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can affect the availability of the system. This likely means the system could become unstable, crash, or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed but involves exploiting a race condition within the kernel's emcom module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker likely needs the ability to execute code that can trigger the multi-threaded resource contention within the kernel. The level of access needed is not explicitly stated, but as it affects the kernel it would likely require local code execution capabilities.

**Affected Versions:**
*   EMUI 10.0.0, EMUI 10.1.0, EMUI 10.1.1, EMUI 11.0.1, EMUI 12.0.0
*   Magic UI 3.0.0, Magic UI 3.1.0, Magic UI 3.1.1
* The June security bulletin also lists it as affecting EMUI 11.0.0 and Magic UI 4.0.0. It appears that the July bulletin lists additional affected versions.
