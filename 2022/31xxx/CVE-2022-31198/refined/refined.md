Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from how the `GovernorVotesQuorumFraction` module in OpenZeppelin's contracts handles quorum changes. Specifically, when the quorum requirement is lowered, past proposals that were previously defeated due to insufficient quorum could become executable if the number of votes they received now meets the new, lower quorum.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Historical Quorum Tracking:** The core weakness is the absence of a mechanism to track the quorum requirements at the time a proposal was voted on. When a proposal's execution is evaluated, the current quorum is checked instead of the quorum at the time of the voting.
*   **Potential for Unexpected Proposal Execution:**  Lowering the quorum can unexpectedly change the outcome of past proposals, which introduces inconsistency and can result in unintended state changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unexpected Execution of Past Proposals:** A governance body could lower the quorum, leading to the execution of proposals that were previously defeated due to the old quorum and that should not have been executable. This can lead to unintended consequences and potential abuse.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Governance Action:** The attack vector is through the normal governance process, which can decide to change the quorum value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Governance Control:** The attacker would need to have the authority to initiate and pass a proposal that lowers the quorum requirements (assuming governance is used to modify the quorum). No special technical skills or external access is needed since it is an internal governance issue.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided GitHub pull request #3561 shows the fix for this issue, which involves tracking historical quorum values to ensure past proposals are evaluated against their quorum requirement at the time of their voting.
*   The advisory also mentions a practical example, finding one proposal that was in such a state at the time of detection, but it was actively monitored.
*   The fix was included in version 4.7.2 of the `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable` npm packages.
*   The advisory recommends a workaround of avoiding lowering quorum requirements if past proposals failed due to lack of quorum.
*   This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-31198.
