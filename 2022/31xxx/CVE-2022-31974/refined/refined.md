Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection (SQLi) in the "Online Fire Reporting System v1.0" by oretnom23.
*   The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `date` parameter in the URL `/ofrs/admin/?page=reports&date=`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly embeds the unsanitized `date` parameter into an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the provided payload which retrieves the database name.
*   **Potential for further compromise:** Depending on the database permissions, an attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data, or gain unauthorized access to the server itself.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a GET request to the vulnerable URL with the `date` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
*   **URL parameter manipulation:**  The attacker modifies the `date` parameter in the URL to inject SQLi payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, as the provided example does not include authentication.

**Detailed Payload:**

*   The provided payload is: `/ofrs/admin/?page=reports&date=2022-05-27'%20union%20select%201,2,3,database(),5,6,7,8,9,10--+`
*   This payload attempts to inject a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the database name and demonstrate the vulnerability by displaying it within the application output.
