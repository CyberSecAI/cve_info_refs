The provided content is related to CVE-2022-31956.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection vulnerability within the `manage_report.php` file of the Rescue Dispatch Management System v1.0. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious SQL queries to be executed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter in the URL. The application does not sanitize the input, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the system, as demonstrated by the ability to leak the database name and potentially other information using SQL injection techniques.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `manage_report.php` endpoint. The attacker injects SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are mentioned to be needed to exploit the SQL injection flaw. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
