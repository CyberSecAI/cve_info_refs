- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of null byte.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Dell BIOS contains an Improper Neutralization of Null Byte vulnerability. Specifically, the BIOS fails to properly handle null bytes in input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local authenticated administrator user may be able to read memory on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: A local authenticated administrator user can send unexpected null bytes to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and must have administrator privileges.
