- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: The XSS vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities such as arbitrary file write, could lead to complete site takeover and compromise of all customers.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly stated, but the vulnerability is due to improper input validation, suggesting it could be triggered through user-supplied input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable input fields and also leverage other vulnerabilities like arbitrary file write.
