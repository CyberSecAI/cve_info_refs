- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `nvlddmkm.sys` kernel mode layer of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows. Specifically, a local user with basic capabilities can trigger an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`).
- **Impact of exploitation**: This vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, or data tampering.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have basic user capabilities on the targeted Windows system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with basic capabilities.
