{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The bleve/http package lacks proper Role Based Access Control (RBAC), input validation, authentication and authorization mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-288",
      "CWE-306",
      "Missing Authentication for Critical Function",
      "Missing Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit HTTP handlers in the `bleve/http` package, such as `CreateIndexHandler` and `DeleteIndexHandler`, to create arbitrary bleve index directories and recursively delete directories owned by the user running the server, anywhere on the filesystem where the server process has write permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending HTTP requests to the exposed handlers of the `bleve/http` package.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server exposing the vulnerable handlers. The attacker would also need to have a valid account and the permissions to trigger the vulnerable handlers. The server's process also has to run as a user that has write access to the filesystem where the indexes are stored, and where the attacker would like to perform further filesystem operations."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The `bleve/http` package is primarily for demonstration purposes and not intended for production use. The vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication and authorization in the provided handlers. The advisory explicitly states that no patch will be provided and advises against using the `bleve/http` package in production environments."
