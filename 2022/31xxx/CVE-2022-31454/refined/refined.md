- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Yii 2 framework.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to XSS because it does not properly sanitize user input when handling requests to the `/books` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed by other users' browsers. This can lead to stealing sensitive user information, hijacking user sessions, or defacing websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `/books` endpoint, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the `/books` endpoint. No special capabilities are explicitly mentioned, but they would need to understand basic web requests and XSS payloads.
