#### Paper 2020/1484

### Cryptanalysis of Aggregate $\Gamma$-Signature and Practical Countermeasures in Application to Bitcoin

Goichiro Hanaoka, Kazuo Ohta, Yusuke Sakai, Bagus Santoso, Kaoru Takemure, and Yunlei Zhao

##### Abstract

We present a sub-exponential forger by using a $k$-sum algorithm
against the aggregate $\Gamma$-signature, which was proposed at AsiaCCS 2019 by Zhao.
Our forger is a universal forger under a key-only attack and effective in the knowledge of secret key model. We also discuss the real impact of this attack in reality with Bitcoin applications.
The discussions on the real impact of the attack also highlight the significant differences between the usage of individual signatures like EC-DSA and that of aggregate signatures in the blockchain systems like Bitcoin, which might be of independent interest and could bring forth interesting questions for future investigations.

## Description

### Impact

The paper [Cryptanalysis of Aggregate Γ-Signature and Practical Countermeasures in Application to Bitcoin](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1484) defines a way to forge valid Γ-signatures, an algorithm that is used in the Biscuit specification version 1.

It would allow an attacker to create a token with any access level.

As Biscuit v1 was still an early version and not broadly deployed, we were able to contact all known users of Biscuit v1 and help them migrate to Biscuit v2.

We are not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability.

### Patches

The version 2 of the specification mandates a different algorithm than gamma signatures and as such is not affected by this vulnerability. The Biscuit implementations in Rust, Haskell, Go, Java and Javascript all have published versions following the v2 specification.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround, any use of Biscuit v1 should be migrated to v2.
