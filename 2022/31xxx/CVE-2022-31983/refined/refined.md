The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Fire Reporting System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/ofrs/admin/?page=requests/manage_request` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection. The application does not properly sanitize the `id` parameter allowing for arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive database information (e.g. database name, tables, columns, user credentials, etc.)

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious SQL query in the `id` parameter of the GET request to `/ofrs/admin/?page=requests/manage_request`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/ofrs/admin/?page=requests/manage_request` and the vulnerable parameter `id`.
- Basic knowledge of SQL syntax is required for exploitation.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated or logged into the application for this particular attack vector.
