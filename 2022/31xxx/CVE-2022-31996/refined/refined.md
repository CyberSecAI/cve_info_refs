Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/bcms/admin/?page=sales/manage_sale&id=` parameter. The application directly uses the value of the `id` parameter in an SQL query without sanitizing it, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database such as user credentials, sales data, or other confidential information.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker may be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the database system and its configuration, it might be possible to gain arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to `/bcms/admin/?page=sales/manage_sale&id=`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to reach the vulnerable endpoint, but administrative access is needed to access the admin panel
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
The attacker injects SQL code within the `id` parameter. Specifically, the provided payload `6' and length(database()) = 7--+` demonstrates how the attacker can use SQL functions to probe database information. The content-length of the response changes based on the result of the injected SQL query, allowing the attacker to infer database information through a boolean based blind SQL injection.

The attacker uses the `length(database())` function to determine the length of the database name, which is 7 in this case, the name of the database is "bcms_db".

The report also includes HTTP request examples showing how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability, including examples where the content length of response changes depending on the database name length.
