# CSRF allows attacker to finalize/unfinalize order adjustments in solidus\_backend

Low

[waiting-for-dev](/waiting-for-dev)
published
GHSA-8639-qx56-r428
Jun 1, 2022

## Package

bundler

solidus\_backend
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 3.1.6, <3.0.6, <2.11.16

## Patched versions

3.1.6, 3.0.6, 2.11.16

## Description

### Impact

CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to change the state of an order's adjustments if they hold its number, and the execution happens on a store administrator's computer.

Reproduction steps:

* Take an order's number.
* Log in as an administrator.
* Visit that order's adjustments section (*Orders -> {Click on number} -> Adjustments*) and check that its adjustments are finalized (closed padlock under the **State** column).
* On another tab, visit `{your_site_url}/admin/orders/{order_number}/adjustments/unfinalize`.
* Notice how the adjustments are unfinalized (open padlock), even if the previous was a `GET` request which could have been linked from any other site.
* Visit `{your_site_url}/admin/orders/{order_number}/adjustments/finalize`.
* Notice how the adjustments are again finalized.

That happened because both routes were handled as `GET` requests, which are skipped by Rails anti-forgery protection.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to solidus\_backend v3.1.6, v3.0.6, or v2.11.16, depending on the major and minor versions in use.

### References

* [Rails CSRF protection](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/RequestForgeryProtection.html).
