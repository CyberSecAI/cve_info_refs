Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-31189

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "Internal System Error" page in the DSpace JSPUI displayed the full exception details, including stack traces, without proper sanitization. This revealed potentially sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The application was exposing detailed error information (stack traces) to users.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The error output was not sanitized before being displayed to users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Attackers could gain valuable information about the system's internal workings, potentially aiding further attacks. This includes class names, method calls, file paths, etc.
- **Enhanced Attack Surface:** The information disclosure could provide attackers with information about the software configuration, potentially revealing vulnerabilities in the application, third party libraries, or the environment it runs in.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering an internal system error in the JSPUI, causing the error page to be displayed. This could be achieved through various means such as malformed inputs, unexpected requests, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to cause an error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the JSPUI of the DSpace application and to trigger an internal system error to view the detailed error page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects DSpace versions 4.0 through 6.3
- It only impacts the JSPUI and not the XMLUI or 7.x
- The fix involves sanitizing the stacktrace output by not displaying it on the error page.
- A patch was released for DSpace 6.x, but the fix can be applied to 5.x too or a workaround can be applied by setting the exception object to null in the `internal.jsp` file before printing it to the response.
