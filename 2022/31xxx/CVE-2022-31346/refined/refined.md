Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the `delete_service` function of the `Master.php` file. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** The provided exploit uses `updatexml` function to extract the database name. An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify database records, or potentially gain complete control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/ocwbs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_service` endpoint.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The `id` parameter within the POST request carries the SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection query.
*   **Understanding of the application's endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint `/ocwbs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_service` and the vulnerable parameter `id`.

**Technical Details:**
*   The injection point is within the SQL query used by the `delete_service` function.
*   The provided payload uses `updatexml` function which is a common method for extracting database information in MySQL environments.

```
Payload: id=2' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+
```

This payload will cause a MySQL error (due to the malformed XML that results from the `concat` function), which in turn will leak the name of the database in the error message.
