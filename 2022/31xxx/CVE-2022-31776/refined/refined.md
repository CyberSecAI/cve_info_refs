- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The DataPower UI does not notify customers if any gateway-peering instance uses the system's default password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the lack of a warning mechanism for default gateway-peering passwords, making it easier for attackers to potentially exploit the default credentials.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of the system if default passwords are not changed.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker who knows or can gain access to a DataPower Gateway instance using the default gateway peering password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need network access to the DataPower Gateway to attempt exploitation.
