Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Play Framework's `DefaultHttpErrorHandler`, when used in development mode, displays verbose error messages including stack traces. The static `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object in the Scala API was configured to always show these verbose errors, regardless of the application mode (dev or production). This object was used as a default in some Play APIs (specifically the constructor for `CORSFilter` and `apply` method for `CORSActionBuilder`). It was also possible to improperly configure the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object instance as the injected error handler. This means that if the static object was inadvertently used or incorrectly configured in a production environment, it would expose sensitive information via stack traces in error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information (stack traces, potential internal paths, etc.) in production error messages.
*   **Incorrect Default Configuration:** The static `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object was designed for dev mode but used as a default value in production-related APIs.
*   **Configuration Misuse:** Developers could improperly configure the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object, leading to the same exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers could potentially gain insight into the application's internal workings, including file paths, library versions, and database connection strings.
*   **Further Exploitation:** This information could be used to assist in launching more targeted attacks or identifying further vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Triggering an Error:** An attacker needs to trigger an error within the application that would result in an exception and the generation of an error response. This could be a variety of application-specific errors or through direct manipulation of input values.
*   **Access to Error Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to see the server's response including verbose error messages (as long as the application is improperly configured), which is common on web applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Error Triggering:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application and trigger a server-side error.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved introducing `DevHttpErrorHandler` for development mode and modifying `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` to use production mode behavior.
*   The vulnerable versions are Play Framework <= 2.8.15.
*   The patched version is Play Framework 2.8.16.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by pull request #11305 which introduced the `DevHttpErrorHandler` and changed the default behavior of `DefaultHttpErrorHandler`.
*   Workarounds involve ensuring a correctly configured error handler is passed when creating `CORSFilter` or `CORSActionBuilder` and avoiding using the static `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object in production code.
*   The severity is considered **low**, likely because it's mostly information leakage and not direct compromise.
