Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries for tracker reports within Tuleap. Specifically, the field names of trackers are not sanitized, which leads to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code through unsanitized tracker field names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- **Full Data Exposure:** This could lead to the complete exposure of sensitive data stored in the database (Confidentiality: High).
- **Data Modification:**  An attacker can modify data, potentially leading to corruption or unauthorized changes (Integrity: High).
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can disrupt the application's availability (Availability: High).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be performed over a network connection (Attack Vector: Network).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have the capability to create new trackers (Privileges required: High).

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in the Tuleap tracker report functionality.
- The vulnerability was fixed by prefixing field names in SQL queries to prevent conflicts with static SQL columns.
- The vulnerable code was present in multiple files related to form element handling in the tracker module.
- The fix was implemented in commit `b91bcd57c8344ec2a4c1833629e400cef4dd901a`.
- The vulnerability affects both Tuleap Community and Enterprise Editions.

**CVSS Score:**

- CVSSv3.1 score: 7.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
