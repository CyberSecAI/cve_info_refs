- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'id' parameter of the '/bcms/admin/?page=service_transactions/view_details' endpoint.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited through the HTTP GET request by manipulating the 'id' parameter with SQL injection payloads.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement to exploit the vulnerability. The provided information indicates that the attacker has knowledge of the application's structure to craft effective payloads, and the system is accessible over the network via IP address.
