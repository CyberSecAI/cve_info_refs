- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `delete_request` function within the `Master.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially complete compromise of the database server. In this case, the attacker can leak the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP POST request to `/ofrs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_request` with a malicious `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application endpoint, and have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
