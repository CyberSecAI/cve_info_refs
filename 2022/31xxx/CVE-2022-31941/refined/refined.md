The provided content is related to CVE-2022-31941.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `manage_user` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection. The application does not sanitize or validate the `id` parameter in the URL, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive database information, such as user credentials, manipulate database entries or potentially gain full access to the database.
- In this specific example, the attacker is able to retrieve the database name.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with an SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL and parameter.
