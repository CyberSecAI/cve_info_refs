Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-31890:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection located in the Audit plugin of osTicket.
- The `order` parameter from the URL is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization.
- An intended check using the `$orderWays` array was ineffective, because the array was not initialized, resulting in the bypass of the sanitization logic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
- The code uses user-controlled input (`$_REQUEST['order']`) directly in the SQL query, violating the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information in the database, such as password hashes, PII (Personally Identifiable Information), and user access privileges.
-  A blind time-based SQL injection is possible, allowing data extraction.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `order` parameter in the URL of the `audits.php` page within the Audit plugin.
- The attacker crafts a malicious `order` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `audits.php` page within the osTicket application.
- No special privileges are explicitly required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `getOrder()` method of the `audit/class.audit.php` file.
- The original code intended to check if the `order` parameter existed in a predefined array (`$orderWays`). However, the array was not defined, causing the check to fail.
- The fix involved defining the `$orderWays` array and modifying the sanitization logic.
- The blog post also provides a python script to showcase the blind time based injection.
