The provided content is related to CVE-2022-31666.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Harbor fails to validate user permissions when updating Webhook policies. Specifically, when handling a PUT request to `/projects/{project_name_or_id}/webhook/policies/{webhook_policy_id}`, the system doesn't properly verify if the authenticated user has the necessary access rights to the project associated with the given `webhook_policy_id`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate authorization checks.
- Lack of proper validation of user permissions when updating webhook policies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can modify Webhook policies configured in other projects, even if they don't have access to those projects.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Sending a crafted PUT request to the `/projects/{project_name_or_id}/webhook/policies/{webhook_policy_id}` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be an authenticated user.
- Attacker needs to know the webhook policy ID of the target they wish to modify.
- Attacker does not require any special permissions beyond basic authenticated access.
