Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Apache HTTP Server handles the `X-Forwarded-*` headers in conjunction with the `Connection` header's hop-by-hop mechanism. Specifically, versions 2.4.53 and earlier might not forward `X-Forwarded-*` headers to the origin server. This occurs when the client uses the `Connection` header to specify hop-by-hop behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of hop-by-hop headers.
- Failure to consistently forward `X-Forwarded-*` headers, potentially leading to inconsistencies between the headers received by the reverse proxy and the origin server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing IP-based authentication:** An attacker can bypass IP-based authentication mechanisms on the origin server/application. By manipulating the `Connection` header, the attacker can prevent the `X-Forwarded-For` header, which typically contains the client's IP address, from reaching the origin server. This can trick the origin server into thinking the request is coming from the reverse proxy itself, rather than the original malicious client.
- **Access control bypass**:  If access control rules are based on the client IP address, an attacker can bypass those by causing the origin server to see the reverse proxy's IP address instead.
- **Information Disclosure**: By modifying request headers through this mechanism, an attacker might be able to access resources or functionality that should otherwise be restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network requests.
- **HTTP request manipulation:**  An attacker needs to manipulate the HTTP `Connection` header to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication on the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to craft HTTP requests, including the ability to manipulate HTTP headers.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.53 and earlier.
- NetApp products using the vulnerable Apache HTTP Server version are also affected including Brocade Fabric Operating System Firmware and ONTAP 9
- The vulnerability has a critical CVSS score of 9.8.
- Fedora has also released updates for this vulnerability
- Gentoo has released a security advisory for this vulnerability, classifying it as high severity.
