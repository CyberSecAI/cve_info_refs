- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected server applications improperly check the size of data packets received for the configuration client login, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to improper input validation. (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can crash the server application, leading to a denial of service condition.
- **Attack vectors**:  An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specially crafted data packets for the configuration client login.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated. They need to be able to send network packets to the server.
