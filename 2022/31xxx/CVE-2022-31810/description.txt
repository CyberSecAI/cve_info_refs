A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated (All versions < V2.90.3.8). Affected server applications improperly check the size of data packets received for the configuration client login, causing a stack-based buffer overflow.

This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash the server application, creating a denial of service condition.
