# CVE-2022-31679: Potential Unintended Data Exposure for Resource Exposed by Spring Data REST

MEDIUM | SEPTEMBER 19, 2022 | CVE-2022-31679
# Description

Applications that allow HTTP PATCH access to resources exposed by Spring Data REST in versions 3.6.0 - 3.6.5, 3.7.0 - 3.7.2, and older unsupported versions, if an attacker knows about the structure of the underlying domain model, they can craft HTTP requests that expose hidden entity attributes.

Workarounds: If the resources exposed by Spring Data REST do not need to support HTTP PATCH requests, you can disable that support as described [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#customizing-sdr.http-methods). Applications that have generally disabled HTTP PATCH support, either through the corresponding configuration of Spring Data REST, Spring Boot or through their runtime infrastructure, are not affected, either.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Data REST
  + 3.6.0 to 3.6.6
  + 3.7.0 to 3.7.2
  + Older, unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: 3.6.x users should upgrade to 3.6.7+ (included in Spring Boot 2.6.12+). 3.7.x users should upgrade to 3.7.3+ (included in Spring Boot 2.7.4+). No other steps are necessary. Releases that have fixed this issue include:

* Spring Data REST
  + 3.6.7+
  + 3.7.3+
