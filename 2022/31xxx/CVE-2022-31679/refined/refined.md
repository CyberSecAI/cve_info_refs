- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Improper handling of HTTP PATCH requests in Spring Data REST when an attacker has knowledge of the underlying domain model. This allows them to craft requests that expose hidden entity attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to access hidden entity attributes through crafted HTTP PATCH requests. The system does not properly restrict access to these attributes when processing PATCH requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to unintended data exposure, where attackers can access sensitive or private information that should not be accessible through the API. The CVSS score indicates a Low confidentiality impact and High Integrity impact.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through network access by sending malicious HTTP PATCH requests to a Spring Data REST endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have knowledge of the underlying domain model's structure in order to craft the malicious requests. They do not need any privileged access, but do need to be able to reach the vulnerable endpoints.
