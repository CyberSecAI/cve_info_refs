- **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin) of NVIDIA vGPU software where a null pointer can be dereferenced.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Null pointer dereference
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user with basic capabilities can trigger the null pointer dereference.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with basic capabilities.
