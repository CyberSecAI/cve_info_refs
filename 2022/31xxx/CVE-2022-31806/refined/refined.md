- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS Control runtime system does not enable password protection by default. There is no prompt or information provided to enable password protection if no password has been set on the controller.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-1188: Insecure Default Initialization of Resource. The software fails to enable a critical security feature (password protection) by default, leaving the system vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the CODESYS Control runtime systems, allowing them to manipulate or disrupt the operation of the industrial controllers and the associated devices.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low skills can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would need network access to the CODESYS Control runtime system.
