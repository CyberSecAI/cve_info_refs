# CloudCore UDS Server: Malicious Message can crash CloudCore

Moderate

[kubeedge-bot](/kubeedge-bot)
published
GHSA-8f4f-v9x5-cg6j
Jun 24, 2022

## Package

gomod

KubeEdge
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=1.10.0, 1.9.2, 1.8.2

## Patched versions

1.11.0, 1.10.1, 1.9.3

## Description

### Impact

A malicious message can crash CloudCore by triggering a nil-pointer dereference in the UDS Server. Since the UDS Server only communicates with the CSI Driver on the cloud side, the attack is limited to the local host network. As such, an attacker would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud.

It will be affected only when users turn on the unixsocket switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` as below:

```
modules:
  cloudHub:
    ...
    unixsocket:
      address: xxx
      enable: true

```
### Patches

This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

### Workarounds

Disable the unixsocket switch of CloudHub in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.

### References

NA

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
