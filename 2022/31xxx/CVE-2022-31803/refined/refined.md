**Root cause of vulnerability:** The CODESYS Gateway Server V2 insufficiently checks the activity of TCP client connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The server does not properly manage TCP client connections.

**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can consume all available TCP connections, preventing legitimate users or clients from establishing new connections to the CODESYS Gateway Server V2. Existing connections remain unaffected.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks. An unauthenticated attacker sends crafted requests to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the CODESYS Gateway Server V2. No authentication is required. The attacker requires low skills to exploit this vulnerability.
