The content is related to CVE-2022-31338.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/ordering/admin/user/index.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script, manipulating the `id` parameter to inject SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application and has to be aware of the vulnerable parameter.
