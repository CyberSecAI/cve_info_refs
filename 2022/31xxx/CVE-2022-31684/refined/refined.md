- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reactor Netty HTTP Server logs request headers in some cases of invalid HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Logging of request headers, which may contain sensitive information like access tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive information (access tokens) to those with access to server logs.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending invalid HTTP requests to a vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server, and access to server logs.
