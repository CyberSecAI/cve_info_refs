#### Weakness

Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity [(CWE-345)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)

#### Summary

An unauthenticated, remote attacker could upload malicious logic to devices based on ProConOS/ProConOS eCLR in order to gain full control over the device.

#### Details

[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31800)

---

#### Impact

An attacker capable of either transmitting manipulated logic or manipulating legitimate logic can execute arbitrary malicious code on the device.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

Phoenix Contact classic line controllers are designed and developed for the use in closed industrial networks. The controller doesn’t feature logic integrity and authenticity checks by design. Phoenix Contact therefore strongly recommends using the devices exclusively in closed networks and protected by a suitable firewall.

Customers using Phoenix Contact classic line controllers are recommended to operate the devices in closed networks or protected with a suitable firewall as intended.

Generic information and recommendations for security measures to protect network-capable
devices can be found in the [application note](https://dam-mdc.phoenixcontact.com/asset/156443151564/0a870ae433c19148b80bd760f3a1c1f2/107913_en_03.pdf).

#### Reported by
