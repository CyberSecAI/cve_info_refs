- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `/ocwbs/admin/?page=user/manage_user` URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user can inject SQL code through the `id` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable URL and manipulate the `id` parameter.
