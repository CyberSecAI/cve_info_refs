Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions set on the `C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy` directory after GOG Galaxy is installed. While the `redists` subdirectory is protected, the parent `Galaxy` and `GOG.com` directories are owned by the user who installed the software, even if they didn't use an administrator account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Folder Permissions:** The parent directories, owned by the installing user, allowed for manipulation of directory structure by a standard user after elevated install.
- **Unprotected Service Execution Path:** The `GalaxCommunication` service, running as SYSTEM, attempts to execute `GalaxyCommunication.exe` from the `redists` folder. By replacing this file and creating a new `redists` directory, an attacker can achieve code execution.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The service does not validate if the binary in `redists` is the expected binary

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** A standard user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, giving them complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File System Manipulation:** An attacker manipulates the directory structure by renaming the original folder and creating a new folder with the same name and a subfolder `redists`.
- **File Replacement:** The attacker replaces the legitimate `GalaxyCommunication.exe` with their own payload.
- **Service Restart/Start:** Restarting or starting the `GalaxCommunication` service triggers the execution of the malicious payload with SYSTEM privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where GOG Galaxy is installed.
- **Standard User Account:** The attacker can use a standard user account that was used to install GOG Galaxy, even if they don't have administrator privileges. They also need the admin password in order to perform the installation.
- **File Manipulation Capabilities:** The attacker requires the ability to rename and create directories, and copy a malicious file into a specific location.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** GOG Galaxy versions 2.0.46 to 2.0.51 (and potentially older versions) are vulnerable.
- **Exploit Steps:** The exploit involves renaming the original `Galaxy` directory, creating a new one with a `redists` subdirectory, placing the payload as `GalaxyCommunication.exe`, and restarting the service.
- **Publicly Available Exploit:** A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit is available on GitHub (`https://github.com/secure-77/CVE-2022-31262`) along with a PowerShell script and a C++ executable for payload execution.
- **Disclosure Timeline:** The vulnerability was reported to GOG on April 9, 2022, with a CVE requested on May 22, 2022. The POC was published on August 11, 2022 after no fix was provided by the vendor.
