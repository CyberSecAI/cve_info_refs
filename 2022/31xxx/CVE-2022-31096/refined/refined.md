- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in Discourse allows logged-in users to bypass email or domain restrictions when redeeming invites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect invite validation, leading to users being added to groups they shouldn't have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to restricted content by users who bypass invite restrictions and are added to restricted groups.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs when a logged-in user attempts to redeem an invite under certain conditions, bypassing email or domain restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user and have access to an invite link.
