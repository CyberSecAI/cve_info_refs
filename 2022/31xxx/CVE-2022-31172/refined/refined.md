Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31172:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption about how `abi.decode` functions in Solidity 0.8. Specifically, `abi.decode` will revert if the raw bytes data overflows the target type, which was a change in behavior introduced in Solidity 0.8.
- This behavior was not accounted for in the `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` function in OpenZeppelin Contracts did not properly handle cases where the target contract (used for signature verification) returns data that causes `abi.decode` to revert due to overflow.
- Specifically, if an EIP-1271 compliant contract returns a bytes response where `abi.decode` causes a revert.
- This unexpected revert in signature verification could disrupt contract logic that expects `isValidSignatureNow` to return `true` or `false`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is that calls to `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` might revert unexpectedly.
- This can cause denial of service issues where contracts are unable to process signatures, or otherwise cause unexpected behavior, depending on how a contract handles an invalid signature.
- The impact is considered "moderate" because it requires a specific scenario where a target contract returns a specifically crafted response that causes `abi.decode` to revert.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to control or manipulate the EIP-1271 target contract such that it returns a byte response that overflows the target type when `abi.decode` is called in `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow`.
- The attack is limited to scenarios where `SignatureChecker` is used to check validity of signatures against potentially malicious or faulty EIP-1271 contracts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deploy a malicious or faulty contract that implements the EIP-1271 interface, and to pass that contract address to a contract which uses `SignatureChecker` for verification.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to cause an overflow in `abi.decode` via the malicious contract response.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue was released in version 4.7.1 of the `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable` npm packages.
- The vulnerability affects versions 4.1.0 up to, but not including, 4.7.1.
- The pull request #3552 on the OpenZeppelin repository addresses the issue, fixing `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` and also `ERC165Checker.supportsERC165InterfaceUnchecked`.
