WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The RUGGEDCOM APE1808 is a powerful utility-grade application hosting platform that lets you deploy
a range of commercially available applications for edge computing and cybersecurity in harsh, industrial
environments.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-30774

DMA attacks on the parameter buffer used by the PnpSmm driver could change the contents after
parameter values have been checked but before they are used (a TOCTOU attack). This issue
was discovered by Insyde engineering during a security review. https://www.insyde.com/security-

# **Insyde's Security Pledge**

#

![](/sites/default/files/page_images/insyde-pledge-3.jpg)

Since our inception 20 years ago, security has been essential. Hundreds of OEMs and ODM partners have trusted us with enabling the platforms that form the foundation of their products, knowing we share their commitment to make them secure. Product security is a top priority with our company and an area of focus that we continue to improve upon every day.

* We sit on the security review team of the industry’s leading firmware standards body; the UEFI Security Response Team.
* We have internal product security experts that drive our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process within our BIOS and BMC firmware teams and evaluate existing and emerging threats.
* We issue regular and timely security alert bulletins when mitigations to vulnerabilities are discovered.
* We work closely with all of our silicon vendor partners to ensure the timely and critical delivery of microcode updates and other patches.

At Insyde, we work with the broader industry to identify, report, mitigate and disclose security vulnerabilities. We support you, our customers and partners, in closing the door to anything which compromises the security or privacy in your platforms. We take this role seriously, because if your firmware is not secure, your product is not secure.

This is our pledge to you. If you have any questions about Insyde Software’s commitment to security, I urge you to reach out to us at security.report@insyde.com

**Tim Lewis, Chief Technology Officer**
