The provided content contains two security advisories related to Harbor, both of which are assigned the same CVE ID, CVE-2022-31671. However, they describe different vulnerabilities, which is likely a mistake.  The advisories are:

**Advisory 1 (GHSA-3wpx-625q-22j7):**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper user permission validation when updating P2P preheat policies.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The system fails to validate user permissions before allowing modifications to P2P preheat policies. Specifically, when handling `PUT /projects/{project_name}/preheat/policies/{preheat_policy_name}` API calls.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  An authenticated attacker can modify P2P preheat policies in projects they don't have access to by using a policy id from that project in the request.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker needs to send a crafted PUT request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user with low privileges.

**Advisory 2 (GHSA-q76q-q8hw-hmpw):**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper user permission validation when reading job execution logs through the P2P preheat execution logs API.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system fails to validate user permissions before allowing read access to job execution logs. Specifically, when handling `GET /projects/{project_name}/preheat/policies/{preheat_policy_name}/executions/{execution_id}/tasks/{task_id}/logs` API calls.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can read any job logs stored in the Harbor database by specifying different job IDs, even if they do not have permission to access them.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker needs to send a crafted GET request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user with low privileges.

Both advisories indicate that the vulnerabilities are fixed in Harbor versions 2.4.3+ and 2.5.2+.
