# Improper Handling of `callbackUrl` parameter in next-auth

High

[balazsorban44](/balazsorban44)
published
GHSA-g5fm-jp9v-2432
Jun 20, 2022

## Package

npm

next-auth
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<3.29.5, <4.5.0

## Patched versions

3.29.5, 4.5.0

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally we convert to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to our **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in the following releases:

next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.5 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. See our [migration guide](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4))

next-auth v4 users before version 4.5.0 are impacted.

### Patches

We've released patches for this vulnerability in:

* v3 - `3.29.5`
* v4 - `4.5.0`

You can do:

```
npm i next-auth@latest
```

or

```
yarn add next-auth@latest
```

or

```
pnpm add next-auth@latest
```

(This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change `latest` to `3` if you want to stay on v3. This is not recommended.)

### Workarounds

If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on [Advanced Initialization](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization#advanced-initialization). Here is an example:

**Before:**

```
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

export default NextAuth(/* your config */)
```

**After:**

```
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

function isValidHttpUrl(url) {
  try {
    return /^https?:/.test(url).protocol
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
}

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (
    req.query.callbackUrl &&
    !isValidHttpUrl(req.query.callbackUrl)
  ) {
   return res.status(500).send('');
  }

  return await NextAuth(req, res, /* your config */)
}
```
### References

This vulnerability was discovered not long after [GHSA-q2mx-j4x2-2h74](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-q2mx-j4x2-2h74 "GHSA-q2mx-j4x2-2h74") was published and is very similar in nature.

Related documentation:

# Initialization

The main entry point of NextAuth.js is the `NextAuth` method that you import from `next-auth`. It handles different types of requests, as defined in the [REST API](/getting-started/rest-api) section.

info

NextAuth.js cannot use the run [Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime) for initialization. The upcoming [`@auth/nextjs` library](https://authjs.dev/reference/next-auth) (which will replace `next-auth`) on the other hand will be fully compatible.

You can initialize NextAuth.js in a few different ways.

## Simple initialization[​](#simple-initialization "Direct link to heading")

### API Routes (`pages`)[​](#api-routes-pages "Direct link to heading")

In Next.js, you can define an API route that will catch all requests that begin with a certain path. Conveniently, this is called [Catch all API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes#catch-all-api-routes).

When you define a `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]` JS/TS file, you instruct NextAuth.js that every API request beginning with `/api/auth/*` should be handled by the code written in the `[...nextauth]` file.

/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
```
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

export default NextAuth({
  ...
})

```

Here, you only need to pass your [options](/configuration/options) to `NextAuth`, and `NextAuth` does the rest.

This is the preferred initialization in tutorials/other parts of the documentation, as it simplifies the code and reduces potential errors in the authentication flow.

### Route Handlers (`app/`)[​](#route-handlers-app "Direct link to heading")

[Next.js 13.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-2#custom-route-handlers) introduced [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers), the preferred way to handle REST-like requests in App Router (`app/`).

You can initialize NextAuth.js with a Route Handler too, very similar to API Routes.

/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
```
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

const handler = NextAuth({
  ...
})

export { handler as GET, handler as POST }

```

Internally, NextAuth.js detects that it is being initialized in a Route Handler (by understanding that it is passed a Web [`Request` instance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)), and will return a handler that returns a [`Response` instance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). A Route Handler file expects you to export some named handler functions that handle a request and return a response. NextAuth.js needs the `GET` and `POST` handlers to function properly, so we export those two.

info

Technically, in a Route Handler, the `api/` prefix is not necessary, but we decided to keep it required for an easier migration.

## Advanced initialization[​](#advanced-initialization "Direct link to heading")

info

The following describes the advanced initialization with API Routes, but everything will apply similarily when using [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers) too.
Instead, `NextAuth` will receive the first two arguments of a Route Handler, and the third argument will be the [auth options](/configuration/options)

If you have a specific use case and need to make NextAuth.js do something slightly different than what it is designed for, keep in mind, the `[...nextauth].ts` config file is just **a regular [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)**.

That said, you can initialize NextAuth.js like this:

/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
```
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

export default async function auth(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  // Do whatever you want here, before the request is passed down to `NextAuth`
  return await NextAuth(req, res, {
    ...
  })
}

```

The `...` section will still be your [options](/configuration/options), but you now have the possibility to execute/modify certain things on the request.

You could for example log the request, add headers, read `query` or `body` parameters, whatever you would do in an API route.

tip

Since this is a catch-all route, remember to check what kind of NextAuth.js "action" is running. Compare the REST API with the `req.query.nextauth` parameter.

For example to execute something on the "callback" action when the request is a POST method, you can check for `req.query.nextauth.includes("callback") && req.method === "POST"`

note

`NextAuth` will implicitly close the response (by calling `res.end`, `res.send` or similar), so you should not run code **after** `NextAuth` in the function body. Using `return NextAuth` makes sure you don't forget that.

Any variable you create this way will be available in the `NextAuth` options as well, since they are in the same scope.

/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
```
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

export default async function auth(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {

  if(req.query.nextauth.includes("callback") && req.method === "POST") {
    console.log(
      "Handling callback request from my Identity Provider",
      req.body
    )
  }

  // Get a custom cookie value from the request
  const someCookie = req.cookies["some-custom-cookie"]

  return await NextAuth(req, res, {
    ...
    callbacks: {
      session({ session, token }) {
        // Return a cookie value as part of the session
        // This is read when `req.query.nextauth.includes("session") && req.method === "GET"`
        session.someCookie = someCookie
        return session
      }
    }
  })
}

```

A practical example could be to not show a certain provider on the default sign-in page, but still be able to sign in with it. (The idea is taken from [this discussion](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/discussions/3133)):

/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
```
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials"
import GoogleProvider from "next-auth/providers/google"

export default async function auth(req, res) {
  const providers = [
    CredentialsProvider(...),
    GoogleProvider(...),
  ]

  const isDefaultSigninPage = req.method === "GET" && req.query.nextauth.includes("signin")

  // Will hide the `GoogleProvider` when you visit `/api/auth/signin`
  if (isDefaultSigninPage) providers.pop()

  return await NextAuth(req, res, {
    providers,
    ...
  })
