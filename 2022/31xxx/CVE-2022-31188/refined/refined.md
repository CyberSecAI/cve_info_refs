{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of URLs used as remote data sources within the CVAT application.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the absence of validation for URLs, allowing for the potential use of non-public IP addresses, which could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) or similar attacks. The code now explicitly checks if the resolved IP address for a provided URL is a public IP address. It also ensures that the URL uses either the 'http' or 'https' scheme.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially supply internal or otherwise non-public IP addresses as the data source for CVAT. This could expose internal services to external attackers or potentially allow the application to be used to probe internal resources.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through providing a malicious or crafted URL as a remote data source. This could happen when a user specifies the URL during task creation or data import.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to provide or manipulate the URL used for remote data in the CVAT application. They would need to be a user of the application or be able to influence its data input."
