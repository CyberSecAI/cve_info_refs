Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection (SQLi) flaw.
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/ordering/admin/products/index.php` script, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Exposure: Attackers can gain access to sensitive data within the database by extracting information such as the database name (`multistoredb` in the example) or potentially other tables and columns.
- Data Modification: The attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted GET request to the `/ordering/admin/products/index.php` script, specifically exploiting the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
-  No Authentication: It is not explicitly stated whether authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability. However, given the nature of the provided URL, it seems likely that it is within an admin area, which would typically require authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The provided payload demonstrates a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to retrieve the database name.
- The payload: `/ordering/admin/products/index.php?view=edit&id=-2%27%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10--+`
    - `-2'` is used to cause an error/null result in the original query, forcing the UNION SELECT to produce the result.
    - `union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10` injects a new query, selecting the database name using the database() SQL function.
    - `--+` comments out the remainder of the original query to avoid SQL syntax errors.
