# Privilege escalation from administrator in eLabFTW

Moderate

[NicolasCARPi](/NicolasCARPi)
published
GHSA-937c-m7p3-775v
May 31, 2022

## Package

elabftw
(elabftw)

## Affected versions

<4.3.0

## Patched versions

4.3.0

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability allows an authenticated user with an administrator role in a team to assign itself system administrator privileges within the application, or create a new system administrator account. The issue has been corrected in the latest version of eLabFTW.

In the context of eLabFTW, an administrator is a user account with certain privileges to manage users and content in their assigned team/teams. A system administrator account can manage all accounts, teams and edit system-wide settings within the application.

The impact is not deemed as high, as it requires the attacker to have access to an administrator account. Regular user accounts cannot exploit this to gain admin rights.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 4.3.0.

### Workarounds

One of the issues can be resolved by removing the ability of administrators to create accounts (see the Sysconfig panel, "Admins can create local accounts:").

### Credit

The issue was discovered and responsibly disclosed by Anders Märak Leffler ([@anargam](https://github.com/anargam)).

### References

For a more complete and precise discussion of user roles, see the [eLabFTW documentation](https://doc.elabftw.net/index.html).

### For more information

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31007

### Weaknesses

[CWE-842](/advisories?query=cwe%3A842) [CWE-1287](/advisories?query=cwe%3A1287)

# Changelog for version 4.3.0

## Breaking changes:

* Completely drop support for non-Docker installation method, [see why](https://doc.elabftw.net/docker-doc.html#why-can-t-i-run-it-outside-docker).
* Require MySQL version 8.0.

  **WARNING** If you are running MySQL version 5.7 or earlier, you might run into encoding issues after updating to MySQL 8.0. First **make sure that you have a proper backup in UTF-8 before upgrading**. You might need to re-import your backup after the upgrade if you run into encoding issues.
* A new mandatory configuration option (environment variable) `SITE_URL` is needed. Edit your configuration file (`/etc/elabftw.yml` by default) and add a new environment variable `SITE_URL` for the `web` (elabftw) container, in the environment part, with a value that corresponds to the address for the instance (including the port if not custom). If this value is not set, the container will show an error and the app won't work until it is fixed. This was previously an optional setting in the instance main config, but it was causing issues, see [#3319](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/issues/3319). (PR [#3323](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3323)). Example:

```
   SITE_URL=https://elab.example.org
```
## Important changes:

* When deletion is requested, the entry isn't really deleted but its `state` is set to deleted. It is not possible anymore to actually delete something . (PR [#3302](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3302))
* When an uploaded file is replaced by a new version, the previous version has its `state` changed to `archived` and is kept around.

## New features:

### For sysadmins:

* You can now configure S3 storage for uploaded files (PR [#3281](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3281)) (and use bin/console uploads:migrate)
* Add `uploads:prune` command to remove deleted files from database and filesystem
* The `db:update` command now displays important messages at the end
* Add `cache:clear` command to clear cached files
* Allow user to request access to a team after SAML authentication (issue [#3244](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/issues/3244), PR [#3246](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3246))
* Show MySQL version in sysadmin page ([#3509](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3509) by Marcel)
* Add a timestamp monthly limit ([#3512](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3512))

### For admins:

* Allow export of data from the Admin panel: experiments, items or scheduler data (PR [#3445](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3445)) (fix [#3386](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/issues/3386))
* When an event is deleted from the scheduler, Admins get a notification

### For users:

* Add import link from link function ([#3488](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3488))
* Allow searching for several metadata fields on search page ([#3473](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3473))
* Allow searching in attachments filename and comment (PR [#3515](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/pull/3515) by Marcel)
* Add write permissions settings when importing CSV or ZIP (fix [#3559](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/issues/3559))
* Many other cosmetic changes and improvements all over the application.
