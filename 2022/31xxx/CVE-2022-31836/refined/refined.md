Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31836:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `leafInfo.match()` function in Beego uses `path.join()` to process wildcard values in routes. This function does not properly sanitize or normalize paths, which allows for path traversal using ".." sequences in URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input (wildcard values) when constructing file paths. The use of `path.join()` allows for directory traversal using `../` sequences.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate route parameters to traverse directories outside of the intended scope, potentially gaining access to sensitive files or resources on the server.
-  Attackers can set arbitrary values for path parameters by using path traversal sequences such as `../` within the URL.
-  The vulnerability affects both standard wildcard routes (e.g., `*.*`) and regex routes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through network requests by crafting malicious URLs with `../` sequences in the path parameters.
-  The attack vector is network based, meaning it can be triggered remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Beego application.
- No specific privileges or user interactions are required.
- The attack can be executed remotely and does not require prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was identified in Beego versions prior to 1.12.11 and v2 versions prior to 2.0.4
-  The vulnerability affects both standard wildcard routes and regex routes, where the path parameter value is constructed using `path.join`.
- The fix involves replacing `path.join()` with `strings.join()`, which does not allow for path traversal, and normalizing the URL before routing.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, which indicates a critical severity.
- The EPSS score is 0.220%.
-  The vulnerability was fixed in pull requests #5025 and #4964
