Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31324:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Download (Authenticated)

*   **Root Cause:** The `downloadAction()` function in the WAPPLES web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for path traversal.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation and insufficient sanitization of the `file_name` parameter in a POST request.
*  **Attack Vector:** A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the `/report/download` endpoint, specifying the path to the target file in the `file_name` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be authenticated to the WAPPLES web interface and have a valid session ID (PHPSESSID).  However, another vulnerability (hardcoded credentials for the API) can bypass the authentication. 
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to download any file accessible by the web server process, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, system files, or database backups.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker sends a POST request to `https://<MGMT_IP>:5001/report/download` with the following data:
*   `Cookie: PHPSESSID=<SESSION_ID>`
*   `file_name=../../../../../../etc/passwd`

This results in the server downloading the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Affected Versions:**

The medium.com article indicates that versions 4, 5, and 6.0 of WAPPLES are vulnerable, but specifically marks 6.0 as vulnerable.
