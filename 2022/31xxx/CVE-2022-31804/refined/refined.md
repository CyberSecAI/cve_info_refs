- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS Gateway Server V2 allocates memory based on the content of the request without proper size validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can cause the allocation of excessive memory, potentially leading to a crash of the Gateway due to an out-of-memory condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted requests to the CODESYS Gateway Server V2.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
