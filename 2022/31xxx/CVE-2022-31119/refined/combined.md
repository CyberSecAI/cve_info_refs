## Description

![@northalpha](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6721009?u=006eb174e0a336e8ea41dd4a3c6fb139c8aae364&v=4&size=48)[northalpha](https://github.com/northalpha)opened [on Mar 7, 2018](https://github.com/nextcloud/mail/issues/823#issue-303150826)
### Steps to reproduce

1. Install mail app
2. configure Mail app, **but** make a fault (e.g. wrong IMAP Server Port) so that the setup is not completed
3. look at nextcloud.log and see: password in PLAINTEXT

### Expected behaviour

Do not log in any circumstances (at least not in Log-Level 2/3) ANY passwords to disk / log file. Although the attack surface might be small (need to have access to logfile local on the NC instance), dumping passwords into logfiles that may be written somewhere else (e.g. rsyslog) is no good.

### Actual behaviour

PLAINTEXT password written to logfile

### Mail app

**Mail app version:** 0.7.10

**Mailserver or service:** dovecot/postfix

**Number of accounts:** -

Account auto detect produce a lot of log messages spamming the log file. This pr will reduce the verbosity of the logged information

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
