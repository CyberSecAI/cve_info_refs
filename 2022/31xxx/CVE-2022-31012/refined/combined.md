[v2.37.1.windows.1](/git-for-windows/git/tree/v2.37.1.windows.1)

[`323a697`](/git-for-windows/git/commit/323a69709944b193bb5cee81ff09fe9a4a686df5)

Changes since Git for Windows v2.37.0 (June 27th 2022)

This release addresses [CVE-2022-31012](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gjrj-fxvp-hjj2) and [CVE-2022-29187](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-j342-m5hw-rr3v).

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.37.1](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.37.1/Documentation/RelNotes/2.37.1.txt).
* Comes with [OpenSSL v1.1.1q](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html).
* Comes with [Git Credential Manager Core v2.0.785](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/releases/tag/v2.0.785).
* Comes with [tig v2.5.5](https://github.com/jonas/tig/releases/tag/tig-2.5.5).

### Bug Fixes

* Pasting large amounts of text in Git for Windows' Bash when running inside Windows Terminal [often resulted in garbled text](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3936), which has been fixed.
* The Perl module [perl-Clone](https://metacpan.org/source/ATOOMIC/Clone-0.45/Changes) which linked to a non-existing DLL was rebuilt to fix the issue.
* The Git for Windows installer can no longer be tricked into running an untrusted `git.exe` in elevated mode ([CVE-2022-31012](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gjrj-fxvp-hjj2)).
* When running Git in a world-writable directory owned by the current user (think `C:\Windows\Temp`, when running under the `SYSTEM` account), the checks for dubious ownership of the `.git` directory now detect this situation properly ([CVE-2022-29187](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-j342-m5hw-rr3v)).

# Git for Windows' installer can be tricked into executing an untrusted binary

High

[dscho](/dscho)
published
GHSA-gjrj-fxvp-hjj2
Jul 12, 2022

## Package

git-for-windows
(-)

## Affected versions

<=v2.37.0

## Patched versions

v2.37.1

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability lets Git for Windows' installer execute a binary placed into `C:\mingw64\bin\git.exe` by mistake (or intent); This only happens upon a fresh install, not when upgrading Git for Windows.

### Patches

Included in v2.37.1

### Workarounds

Create the `C:\mingw64` folder and remove read/write access from this folder:

```
mkdir C:\mingw64
icacls C:\mingw64 /inheritance:r

```

Alternatively, disallow arbitrary authenticated users to create folders in `C:\` (open the Properties of `C:\`, go to the `Security` tab and then click `Advanced`, then remove the Special Permission to create folders for authenticated users).

### Credits

Many thanks to ‰øûÊô®‰∏ú and the Lockheed Martin Red Team for (independently) finding and reporting the vulnerability!

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the Git for Windows project](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/new)
* For sensitive questions or responsible disclosures, email the Git Security mailing list
* Email the Git project or [post to Git for Windows' Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/git-for-windows).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

### Impact

Privilege escalation in all platforms

An unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765, for example when navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them, but where an attacker could create a git repository by doing:

```
$ git -C /tmp init

```
### Patches

ETA of first half of July, 2022

### Workarounds

The simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described in the example is to avoid running git as root (or an Administrator in Windows), and if needed to reduce its use to a minimum.

While a generic workaround is not possible, a system could be hardened from the exploit described in the example by removing any such repository if it exists already and creating one as root to block any future attacks.
