      "root_cause": "The `CreateOrConfigureAsync` function in `Docker.Backend.HyperV` creates a `DockerDesktop.vhdx` file based on the path specified in the `DataFolder` setting. This path is user-controlled via the Docker Desktop API. A TOCTOU vulnerability exists because the file is created by a privileged service (`vmms.exe`) and an attacker can use a junction with an object manager symlink to redirect the file creation to any location",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Arbitrary file overwrite"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can overwrite any file on the system (although they can't control the file content). This can potentially be leveraged to achieve privilege escalation or cause a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker can call the create API function implemented by the `CreateOrConfigureAsync` function in `Docker.Backend.HyperV`. This API allows them to control the `DataFolder` setting and thus, the location where the `DockerDesktop.vhdx` file is created. The attacker uses a junction directory with an object manager symlink to redirect file creation to an arbitrary location."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to make API calls to Docker Desktop. They must also be able to create junctions and object manager symlinks.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the file creation itself, not during a file deletion as with CVE-2022-37326. The file is created by the vmms.exe service, not by `com.docker.service`"
