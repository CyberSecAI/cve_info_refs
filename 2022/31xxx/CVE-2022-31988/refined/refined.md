The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Badminton Center Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `date` parameter of the `/bcms/admin/?page=reports/daily_services_report` endpoint, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to:
    - Access sensitive data from the database (e.g. database name).
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system through further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `date` parameter of the `/bcms/admin/?page=reports/daily_services_report` endpoint.
- The attack is performed via HTTP GET request by injecting SQL code into the date parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No specific privileges are mentioned, implying that this might be exploitable without prior authentication.

**Details:**
The attacker can use the following payload in the `date` parameter: `2022-05-27' union select 1,2,3,4,database(),6,7--+` to inject SQL code and extract the database name.
