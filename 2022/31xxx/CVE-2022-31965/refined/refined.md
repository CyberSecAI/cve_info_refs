The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Rescue Dispatch Management System v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input passed through the `id` parameter in the URL `/rdms/admin/respondent_types/manage_respondent_type.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses the `id` parameter from the URL in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by manipulating the SQL query. This is demonstrated by the example, where the attacker uses `length(database())` to determine the database name length. It's implied that the attacker could also extract user data or other sensitive information, and potentially modify or delete data.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/rdms/admin/respondent_types/manage_respondent_type.php` with a crafted `id` parameter.
- Example payload: `/rdms/admin/respondent_types/manage_respondent_type.php?id=1%27%20and%20length(database())%20=7--+`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated since the vulnerability is present in an admin file, but the login details for the admin backend are provided in the report `admin/admin123`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The report includes screenshots showing the difference in `Content-Length` based on whether the database length matches the specified condition, which confirms the vulnerability is exploitable.
- The report also includes the vulnerable file path: `/rdms/admin/respondent_types/manage_respondent_type.php?id=`
- The vulnerable parameter is: `id`
- The report uses a boolean-based SQL injection to determine the length of the database name, confirming SQL injection vulnerability exists.
