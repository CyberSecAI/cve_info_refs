Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-31384

**Description:** The Directory Management System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `fullname` parameter in `add-directory.php`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `fullname` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's SQL query, leading to unauthorized database access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database including usernames, passwords, personal details, and other confidential data.
- Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete existing data, leading to data integrity issues.
- Privilege Escalation: Depending on database user permissions, attackers might be able to gain elevated privileges.
- Complete System Compromise: In some scenarios attackers could execute operating system commands leading to a complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/dms/admin/add-directory.php` endpoint.
- Malicious Payload in the `fullname` parameter: The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `fullname` parameter within the POST request payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Basic Understanding of SQL Injection: The attacker should understand SQL injection techniques and how to craft malicious SQL payloads.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/dms/admin/add-directory.php`) and parameter (`fullname`).
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker needs a tool or script capable of sending HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details (from the provided exploit):**
- The exploit demonstrates an example of injecting `database()` into the SQL query.
- The provided payload is:
```
fullname=database()','$profession','$email','$mobilenumber','$address',database(),'$admsta')%23&profession=aaaa&email=aaa%40aaa.aaa&mobilenumber=aaa&city=aaa&address=aaaa&submit=
```
- This payload attempts to inject the `database()` function, which will reveal the database name being used by the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided github.com_accb9735_20250114_205229.html, github.com_a1b59367_20250115_183932.html and github.com_dba769c8_20250115_183931.html do not provide any further info about the vulnerability.
- phpgurukul.com_c807b446_20250114_205228.html contains information about the software vendor, but not the specific vulnerability.

In summary, the provided content clearly demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability in the Directory Management System v1.0, caused by the lack of sanitization of the `fullname` parameter in the `add-directory.php` script.
