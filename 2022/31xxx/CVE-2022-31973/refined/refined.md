The provided content details a vulnerability in the Online Fire Reporting System v1.0 by oretnom23. It allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `delete_img` function in the `Master.php` class. The application does not properly sanitize or validate the file path provided in the `path` parameter, allowing for arbitrary file deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The application directly uses the provided path to delete a file without any checks or sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the file path provided in the request, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** An attacker can delete any file on the server, leading to data loss and potentially disrupting the application's functionality.
- **System Instability:** Deleting critical system files could lead to system instability or complete failure of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/ofrs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img` with the `path` parameter set to the file they want to delete.
- **URL Encoding:** The path parameter needs to be URL encoded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the application.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** While the provided exploit doesn't require explicit authentication, it is noted that the backend login credentials are `admin/admin123`, which may allow access to other parts of the application, but it is not required for this specific file deletion vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know the absolute path of the file they want to delete on the server.
