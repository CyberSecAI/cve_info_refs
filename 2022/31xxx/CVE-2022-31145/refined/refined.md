Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `flyteadmin` application not properly validating the expiration of Access Tokens and ID Tokens when using an external identity provider (IdP). This means that even after tokens expire, authenticated users can continue to use them to access resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Token Expiration Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of token expiration, allowing the use of expired tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain or maintain unauthorized access to the system by using an expired token that should have been invalidated. This would allow them to potentially perform actions that require authentication, even after their session should have expired, essentially bypassing the intended expiration mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **External Identity Provider:** The vulnerability is only exploitable when `flyteadmin` is configured to use an external OAuth2 identity provider.
*   **Expired Tokens:** An attacker must obtain an access token or ID token from the external provider, and then use the token after it has expired.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Credentials/Token:** The attacker needs valid credentials or a valid token initially obtained from an external IdP.
*   **Access to flyteadmin:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the flyteadmin service, and present the expired token as authentication.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of `flyteadmin` prior to 1.1.29 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.29 and later.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Rotating signing keys immediately can invalidate all open sessions and force users to obtain new tokens.
    *   Continue to rotate keys until `flyteadmin` has been upgraded.
    *   Hiding the flyteadmin deployment ingress URL from the internet can reduce exposure.
*   **Fix:** The fix is implemented in [PR #455](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/pull/455) which modifies the `resource_server.go` file to correctly validate token expiry. The changes in `resource_server_test.go` add test cases to verify this fix, including one for no signature and another for expired tokens.
*   **Code Changes:** The code changes include:
    *   Using `jwtgo.NewParser().ParseUnverified` to parse the token before signature verification.
    *   Adding `t.Claims.Valid()` check.
    *   Adjusting test cases to reflect changes and address scenarios.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-31145 in `flyteadmin` allows for the continued use of expired access tokens from an external identity provider, potentially leading to unauthorized access. The vulnerability is mitigated in version 1.1.29 and can be worked around by rotating signing keys and restricting external access to the deployment.
