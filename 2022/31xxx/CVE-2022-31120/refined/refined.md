Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of audit logging for federated share acceptance and declination events in Nextcloud. This means that when a user accepts or declines a federated share, this action isn't recorded in the audit log.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is the **incomplete audit logging**. The system fails to record critical actions related to federated shares, specifically when a user accepts or declines such a share. This creates a gap in the audit trail.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of this vulnerability is primarily a lack of visibility into user actions related to federated shares.  This could have the following implications:
* **Incomplete audit trail:**  Administrators cannot fully track actions taken on federated shares, potentially hindering compliance efforts and security investigations.
* **Difficulty in incident response:**  Without proper logging, it becomes more difficult to understand who accepted/declined what shares and when, complicating incident response efforts if unauthorized sharing or access occurs.
* **Reduced accountability:** The absence of logs reduces the ability to hold users accountable for their actions regarding federated shares.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is **adjacent**, meaning that an attacker would need to be on the same network (or have network access) as the Nextcloud server. A malicious user with an account on the Nextcloud instance can trigger the vulnerability by simply accepting or declining a federated share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Privileges Required**: The attacker needs to have high privileges on the Nextcloud instance. This implies being a user with the ability to interact with federated shares (e.g., receiving and responding to share invitations).
* **User interaction**: The attacker needs to actively accept or decline a share.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions**: Nextcloud Server versions prior to 22.2.7 and 23.0.4 are affected. This includes versions < 22.2.7 and < 23.0.4.
*   **Patched Versions**: Nextcloud Server versions 22.2.7, 23.0.4, and 24.0.0 include the fix for this vulnerability.
*   **Severity**: The severity is classified as "Low".
*  **CVSS Score**: The CVSS v3 base score is 2.1 with vector string:  CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N, reflecting low impact on Integrity and no impact on Availability or Confidentiality.
*   **Fix**: The provided Github commit (https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/31594) introduces logging of these events by dispatching `CriticalActionPerformedEvent` in the `RequestHandlerController`.
*   The `portal.nextcloud.com` content confirms the audit log as the area impacted by this vulnerability: "The audit log is used to get a full trail of the actions which is now incompletely."
