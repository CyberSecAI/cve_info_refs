The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Badminton Center Management System v1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `delete_service` function within the `Master.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially gain control of the database server. In this specific example, the attacker is using the SQL injection to extract the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is reachable via an HTTP POST request to `/bcms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_service` with a crafted `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and have knowledge of the SQL database.
