Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-31094.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "Recently Viewed Projects" feature in ScratchTools is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application renders project titles without sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within project titles. When a user views a project with such a crafted title, the injected JavaScript executes in the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper sanitization of project titles.
- The application renders the project titles directly into the HTML without escaping or sanitizing them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser. This could lead to:
    - Account takeover by stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.
    - Other malicious actions depending on the attacker's intentions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker creates a project on the platform and injects malicious JavaScript into the project's title.
- The victim user views this project which adds it to their recently viewed projects list
- When the victim user views their recently viewed projects, the malicious JavaScript in the title executes in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a project on the platform and modify the project title to include malicious javascript.
- The attacker needs to entice the victim to visit the malicious project.
