{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Harbor fails to validate user permissions when updating a robot account.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authorization leading to the possibility of modifying robot account permissions by users without the required access to the project.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could revoke robot account permissions by sending a crafted request to update a robot account belonging to a different project, even if they do not have access to that project.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network; Sending a PUT request to the /robots/{robot_id} API endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low privileges are required, and no user interaction is needed. The attacker must have a valid user account to make the API request."
