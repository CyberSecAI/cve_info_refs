Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper quoting of columns when using `setOrderBy()` or `setGroupBy()` methods within Pimcore's listing classes. These classes are intended to facilitate data querying. The quoting was not properly implemented, specifically when using user-provided input for ordering or grouping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection (CWE-89). Because the `setOrderBy()` and `setGroupBy()` methods did not properly sanitize or quote input, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code via the request parameters `orderBy` and `groupBy`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Data modification
    *   Denial of Service
    *   Privilege escalation, depending on the database user's permissions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests. Specifically, the attacker can manipulate the `orderBy` and `groupBy` parameters in the URL when those parameters are passed to `setOrderBy()` and `setGroupBy()` methods of listing classes

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to an application using vulnerable versions of Pimcore.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the listing class usage to inject the malicious SQL code through parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided example code demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by injecting SQL via the `groupBy` parameter.
*   The fix involves properly quoting the identifiers using `quoteIdentifier()` method before using them in the SQL query.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 10.4.4 of pimcore.

**Summary of Patches:**

The patch involves changes to `lib/Model/Listing/AbstractListing.php`:
*   The `setOrderKey` function was updated to use the `quoteIdentifier` function when quoting the order key, and to only quote valid order keys.
*   The `setGroupBy` function was updated to use the `quoteIdentifier` function to quote each part of a comma separated group by string.
*   A `quoteIdentifier` function was added which uses the database connection to quote an identifier.
