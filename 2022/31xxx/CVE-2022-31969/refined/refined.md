The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability found in the "ChatBot App with Suggestion v1.0" application by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided through the `id` parameter in the URL when querying the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `manage_user` page within the admin panel.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database.
- In the provided example, the attacker leaks the database name using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
- Sensitive information stored in the database can be accessed, modified, or deleted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to the `simple_chat_bot/admin/?page=user/manage_user` endpoint.
- The malicious SQL payload is injected into the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Access to the admin panel is required to reach the vulnerable page.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker uses the following payload:
`/simple_chat_bot/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=-4' union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10--+`

This payload exploits the SQL injection by:
1. Injecting `-4'` to terminate the original query.
2. Appending `union select` to combine the results with a crafted query.
3. Using `database()` to extract the name of the database.
4. Adding `1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10` to match the number of columns in the original query.
5. Using `--+` to comment out any subsequent parts of the original SQL query.
