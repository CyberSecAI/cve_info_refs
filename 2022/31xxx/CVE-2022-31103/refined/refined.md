Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-31103

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of CSS at-rules, specifically `@keyframes`, within the `lettersanitizer` library. The library failed to properly sanitize or process these rules, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-707:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Regular Expression. It is possible that the regex used to parse/sanitize the CSS did not correctly handle the `@keyframes` at-rule leading to excessive processing time.
- **CWE-835:** Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop'). The improper handling of `@keyframes` led to an infinite loop or other resource-intensive process that made the browser unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** When processing HTML containing a crafted style tag with `@keyframes`, the `lettersanitizer` library causes a 100% CPU usage and browser unresponsiveness, effectively denying service to the user.
- The issue was initially reported in the `react-letter` library, which depends on `lettersanitizer`, impacting all users of `react-letter`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through providing crafted HTML content containing a `<style>` tag with a malicious `@keyframes` rule. This input is processed by the `lettersanitizer` library, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML content that is then processed by the vulnerable `lettersanitizer` library, specifically through the `react-letter` component. This could be achieved via user-submitted data or content coming from a different source.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in `lettersanitizer` version 1.0.2.
- The fix involved filtering out unsupported at-rules (including `@keyframes`) from CSS.
- Users of `react-letter` are advised to update their dependencies to include the patched version of `lettersanitizer`.
- A user reported experiencing the issue and limited the maximum number of while loops in the `lettersanitizer` library as a workaround.
