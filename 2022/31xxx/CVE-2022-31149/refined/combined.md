## Attack flow

1. Victim visits `http://140.238.208.152:8081/awbuckets` because it looks like a cool blog or smth.
2. The script on `awbuckets.html` will dynamically load an iframe from the domain `A.140.238.208.152.1time.127.0.0.1.forever.randomPart.rebind.cryptosec.se` on port 5600.
3. The first time the browser does a DNS record for this domain, it will see the result `140.238.208.152`, and thus it will fetch the page `140.238.208.152:5600/exporter-buckets.html`.
4. The `exporter-buckets.html` page contains a JavaScript that does a `fetch()` for `/api/0/buckets/`, i.e. the same domain as it already is on. **Naturally, the browser believes this is the same origin**.
5. The domain `A.140.238.208.152.1time.127.0.0.1.forever.randomPart.rebind.cryptosec.se` has a short TTL (1 second). It has now expired. The browser does a new DNS request for the same domain.
6. The whonow DNS server now returns 127.0.0.1 as the IP of the domain, since it is the second time it gets a request. **The browser still consider this the same origin, since the domain is the same, even though the IP differs**
7. The browser happily accepts the result, and will now request `127.0.0.1/api/0/export`.
8. The attack scripts stores the result, and uploads it to some attacker controlled server.
9. Success!

| [@ErikBjare](https://github.com/ErikBjare) Sorry to bring this up again, but the microsoft/winget-pkgs repository needs to be forked under [@ActivityWatchBot](https://github.com/ActivityWatchBot) rather than the organization itself. You can re-run the workflow after this to publish the release to winget. I had forgotten it earlier 🙏🏻 |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
