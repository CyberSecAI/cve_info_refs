The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Rescue Dispatch Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `delete_respondent_type` function within the `/rdms/classes/Master.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. In this specific case, the provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract database information using the `updatexml` function. This could lead to complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `/rdms/classes/Master.php` endpoint, by injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges are explicitly mentioned but likely, the attacker needs to be able to access the application endpoint. The provided example shows that they must have access to the `delete_respondent_type` functionality which may be restricted behind authentication.
