The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Fire Reporting System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `/ofrs/admin/?page=teams/view_team` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can leak sensitive information from the database. The provided example demonstrates leaking the database name.
- Other potential impacts, not explicitly shown in the provided content, could include: reading or modifying arbitrary data, bypassing authentication, or potentially executing arbitrary code on the database server, depending on the database system and configuration, and attacker capabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/ofrs/admin/?page=teams/view_team` by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- No specific authentication is mentioned as a requirement, however, the vulnerable endpoint is located in the `/admin/` part of the application, which might imply that some level of authentication would be required to access this page. The provided document mentions the default credentials for the admin panel are "admin/admin123".
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, which is a very basic capability for an attacker.
- The attacker should have some understanding of SQL syntax to craft appropriate payloads, although basic SQL knowledge is sufficient for initial exploitation and information gathering as shown in the document.
