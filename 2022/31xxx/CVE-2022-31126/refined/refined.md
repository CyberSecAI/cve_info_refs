- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the `ssh_command` function of the `/app/options.py` file in Roxy-wi. It allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Code Injection (CWE-94)
    - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-77)
    - Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (CWE-116)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, data modification, and service disruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/app/options.py` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
