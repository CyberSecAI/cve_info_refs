Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-31861:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the audit logs feature of the ThingsBoard IoT Platform. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before displaying it in the audit logs.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Stored XSS vulnerability: A malicious script can be stored in the system's database.
    *   Lack of input sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user inputs, specifically the "email" field, allowing for injection of HTML and JavaScript.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Account takeover: A lower-privileged customer user can inject a malicious script that, when viewed by a tenant administrator, executes in the admin's browser. This script can steal the administrator's authentication token (JWT token), leading to account takeover.
    *   Lateral movement: By taking over the tenant admin account, an attacker can potentially target all customers within the same tenant.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request by a customer user to update their own profile.
    *   The malicious payload is embedded within the "email" parameter of the user profile.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an existing, authenticated customer-level user on the ThingsBoard platform.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to edit their own profile.
