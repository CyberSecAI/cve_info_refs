### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

### @digitalresistor **[digitalresistor](/digitalresistor)** commented [Apr 21, 2022](#issue-1211418033)

There's a potential issue whereby a thread attempts to send data, but the socket is closed on the other end, and the thread shuts the socket down.

This may however happen while the file descriptors are being put together before being passed to `select()` which will then fail as that file descriptor is no longer valid.

Instead we loop until we have called `select()` successfully, while checking to see if the file descriptors has changed since we started the poll.

If the map of file descriptors has not changed, and yet we get an `errno` that is a bad file descriptor, we will just raise it and kill the main loop.

Closes [#374](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/374)

| This change has now been updated to the following:   1. The main thread can call close() on a socket, but an app thread can't 2. App thread will pull the trigger (because no data was flushed) waking up the main thread to call close()   This solves the race condition and allows `select()` to function as before. |

2.1.2
-----

Bugfix
~~~~~~

- When expose_tracebacks is enabled waitress would fail to properly encode
  unicode thereby causing another error during error handling. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/378

- Header length checking had a calculation that was done incorrectly when the
  data was received across multple socket reads. This calculation has been
  corrected, and no longer will Waitress send back a 413 Request Entity Too
  Large. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/376

Security Bugfix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- in 2.1.0 a new feature was introduced that allowed the WSGI thread to start
  sending data to the socket. However this introduced a race condition whereby
  a socket may be closed in the sending thread while the main thread is about
  to call select() therey causing the entire application to be taken down.
  Waitress will no longer close the socket in the WSGI thread, instead waking
  up the main thread to cleanup. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/377

2.1.1
-----

Security Bugfix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Waitress now validates that chunked encoding extensions are valid, and don't
  contain invalid characters that are not allowed. They are still skipped/not
  processed, but if they contain invalid data we no longer continue in and
  return a 400 Bad Request. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request
  smuggling. Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36

- Waitress now validates that the chunk length is only valid hex digits when
  parsing chunked encoding, and values such as ``0x01`` and ``+01`` are no
  longer supported. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request smuggling.
  Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36

- Waitress now validates that the Content-Length sent by a remote contains only
  digits in accordance with RFC7230 and will return a 400 Bad Request when the
  Content-Length header contains invalid data, such as ``+10`` which would
  previously get parsed as ``10`` and accepted. This stops potential HTTP
  desync/HTTP request smuggling Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36

2.1.0
-----

Python Version Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python 3.6 is no longer supported by Waitress

- Python 3.10 is fully supported by Waitress

Bugfix
~~~~~~

- ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` now sets the ``seekable``, ``seek``, and ``tell``
  attributes from the underlying file if the underlying file is seekable. This
  allows WSGI middleware to implement things like range requests for example

  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/359 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/363

- In Python 3 ``OSError`` is no longer subscriptable, this caused failures on
  Windows attempting to loop to find an socket that would work for use in the
  trigger.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/361

- Fixed an issue whereby ``BytesIO`` objects were not properly closed, and
  thereby would not get cleaned up until garbage collection would get around to
  it.

  This led to potential for random memory spikes/memory issues, see
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/358 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/357 .

  With thanks to Florian Schulze for testing/vaidating this fix!

Features
~~~~~~~~

- When the WSGI app starts sending data to the output buffer, we now attempt to
  send data directly to the socket. This avoids needing to wake up the main
  thread to start sending data. Allowing faster transmission of the first byte.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/364

  With thanks to Michael Merickel for being a great rubber ducky!

- Add REQUEST_URI to the WSGI environment.

  REQUEST_URI is similar to ``request_uri`` in nginx. It is a string that
  contains the request path before separating the query string and
  decoding ``%``-escaped characters.")`

# Uncaught Exception (due to a data race) leads to process termination

Low

[digitalresistor](/digitalresistor)
published
GHSA-f5x9-8jwc-25rw
May 30, 2022

## Package

pip

waitress
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

2.1.0
2.1.1

## Patched versions

2.1.2
2.1.2

## Description

### Impact

Waitress may terminate early due to a thread closing a socket while the main thread is about to call select(). This will lead to the main thread raising an exception that is not handled and then causing the entire application to be killed.

### Patches

This issue has been fixed in Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to close the socket, instead it is always delegated to the main thread.

### Workarounds

There is no work-around, however users using waitress behind a reverse proxy server are less likely to have issues if the reverse proxy always reads the full response.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues> (if not sensitive or security related)
* email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31015

### Weaknesses

[CWE-248](/advisories?query=cwe%3A248)

### @digitalresistor **[digitalresistor](/digitalresistor)** commented [Apr 21, 2022](#issue-1211418033)

There's a potential issue whereby a thread attempts to send data, but the socket is closed on the other end, and the thread shuts the socket down.

This may however happen while the file descriptors are being put together before being passed to `select()` which will then fail as that file descriptor is no longer valid.

Instead we loop until we have called `select()` successfully, while checking to see if the file descriptors has changed since we started the poll.

If the map of file descriptors has not changed, and yet we get an `errno` that is a bad file descriptor, we will just raise it and kill the main loop.

Closes [#374](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/374)

| It unfortunately does have drawbacks in that there are still race conditions in the code. I've got a better fix, I just haven't had time to test/validate/implement it.  I'm sorry you were hit by this too :-( |

| This change has now been updated to the following:   1. The main thread can call close() on a socket, but an app thread can't 2. App thread will pull the trigger (because no data was flushed) waking up the main thread to call close()   This solves the race condition and allows `select()` to function as before. |

Sorry, something went wrong.

2.1.2
-----

Bugfix
~~~~~~

- When expose_tracebacks is enabled waitress would fail to properly encode
  unicode thereby causing another error during error handling. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/378

- Header length checking had a calculation that was done incorrectly when the
  data was received across multple socket reads. This calculation has been
  corrected, and no longer will Waitress send back a 413 Request Entity Too
  Large. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/376

Security Bugfix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- in 2.1.0 a new feature was introduced that allowed the WSGI thread to start
  sending data to the socket. However this introduced a race condition whereby
  a socket may be closed in the sending thread while the main thread is about
  to call select() therey causing the entire application to be taken down.
  Waitress will no longer close the socket in the WSGI thread, instead waking
  up the main thread to cleanup. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/377

2.1.1
-----

Security Bugfix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Waitress now validates that chunked encoding extensions are valid, and don't
  contain invalid characters that are not allowed. They are still skipped/not
  processed, but if they contain invalid data we no longer continue in and
  return a 400 Bad Request. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request
  smuggling. Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36

- Waitress now validates that the chunk length is only valid hex digits when
  parsing chunked encoding, and values such as ``0x01`` and ``+01`` are no
  longer supported. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request smuggling.
  Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36

- Waitress now validates that the Content-Length sent by a remote contains only
  digits in accordance with RFC7230 and will return a 400 Bad Request when the
  Content-Length header contains invalid data, such as ``+10`` which would
  previously get parsed as ``10`` and accepted. This stops potential HTTP
  desync/HTTP request smuggling Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36

2.1.0
-----

Python Version Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python 3.6 is no longer supported by Waitress

- Python 3.10 is fully supported by Waitress

Bugfix
~~~~~~

- ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` now sets the ``seekable``, ``seek``, and ``tell``
  attributes from the underlying file if the underlying file is seekable. This
  allows WSGI middleware to implement things like range requests for example

  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/359 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/363

- In Python 3 ``OSError`` is no longer subscriptable, this caused failures on
  Windows attempting to loop to find an socket that would work for use in the
  trigger.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/361

- Fixed an issue whereby ``BytesIO`` objects were not properly closed, and
  thereby would not get cleaned up until garbage collection would get around to
  it.

  This led to potential for random memory spikes/memory issues, see
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/358 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/357 .

  With thanks to Florian Schulze for testing/vaidating this fix!

Features
~~~~~~~~

- When the WSGI app starts sending data to the output buffer, we now attempt to
  send data directly to the socket. This avoids needing to wake up the main
  thread to start sending data. Allowing faster transmission of the first byte.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/364

  With thanks to Michael Merickel for being a great rubber ducky!

- Add REQUEST_URI to the WSGI environment.

  REQUEST_URI is similar to ``request_uri`` in nginx. It is a string that
  contains the request path before separating the query string and
  decoding ``%``-escaped characters.")`

| I just might be wrong because if this indeed a race condition it should be breaking more things.

| [@oakkitten](https://github.com/oakkitten) could you try this patch: [#377](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/377) and see if it stops the main thread from dying? I have been unable to come up with a good way to test/validate this fixes the issue.  It's not the best solution, but short of rewriting `asyncore` it hopefully provides relief as we just try again. |

| I'm not familiar with the codebase, but from what I've seen while trying to catch the issue—  Perhaps, instead of calling `del_channel`, which mutates `map`, and then closing the socket in a worker thread, it would be more simple to just flag the channel for closing? Like, you set a flag on a channel, such as `must_be_closed_in_the_main_loop`, or perhaps have a separate list of objects that must be closed (lists are said to be thread-safe), and then the main loop checks if anything should be closed before doing `select()`. This way the code would be a bit easier to reason about I think.  Also, you are doing  ``` if fds != map.keys():     fds = map.keys() ```  `dict.keys()` returns not a copy of keys, but a special `dict_keys` object that is a view of dictionary keys that changes along with the dictionary. So if read this right, `fds == map.keys()` will always be true.  Also, there's the issue with the modification of `map` itself. While it never blew up in my face during tests, it probably can, since when you modify a dictionary while iterating you get this:  ``` >>> d = {x: x for x in range(5)} >>> for x in d.keys(): ...     print(x) ...     if x == 3: ...         del d[x] ... 0 1 2 3 Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration ```  I suppose even doing `list(map.keys())` is dangerous. |

| Good point on the `dict.keys()` I forgot about that change in Py3.  We never iterate the map and delete from it though in the code change I made.  I am trying to avoid changing too much of asyncore as that was wholesale lifted from Py 3.5.  If you were to use `poll()` instead of `select()` I would imagine the problem would be masked because `poll()` will simply return that there is an error on the socket, whereas `select()` fails and raises `OSError`. So I was attempting to make `select()` act more like `poll()` in this situation.  This only really happens if the remote closes the connection before having read the full response, which is likely why it is not often seen in the wild, as most reverse proxies will have already read the full response.  The problem with attempting to add yet another list, is that there is no single object, the `map` is passed down from the `serve` function, and is passed around, but to add another list that would mean adding another variable that is passed around to the various functions as the `loop()` function does not currently have that.  Trying to set a flag inside the thread and trying to make sure that can be read throughout the `asyncore` functions so that it doesn't close the sockets was something I looked at, but it is difficult as there are various places where `asyncore` expects to be able to close the socket.  It's going to require more intrusive changes, which makes sense as `asyncore` was never really meant to be thread safe. This is a consequence of trying to send data faster without waking the main thread up. |

| Using `list(map.keys())` should be fine. Since the only reason `select()` can fail is if it has a file descriptor that is no longer valid (and thus no longer in the map). Comparing the original map we used for `select()` against the new `map.keys()` should show that there is a difference, at that point we just start the `select()` call again with the new list of file descriptors.  Eventually a call to `select()` will succeed.  I am going to see if I can write a test that causes the race.  You mentioned you are seeing this in tests, are you running waitress in a thread or a separate process? |

| You don't iterate the map and delete from it in the code change you made, but I think you might be doing that in the already existing code?   * The main thread says [`list(map.items())`](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/603d2c12ce09fcd1be0b7a5734b4fca339820286/src/waitress/wasyncore.py#L157). * `close()` [calls `del_channel()`](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/603d2c12ce09fcd1be0b7a5734b4fca339820286/src/waitress/wasyncore.py#L464), and `del_channel()` [says `del map[fd]`](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/603d2c12ce09fcd1be0b7a5734b4fca339820286/src/waitress/wasyncore.py#L347). This can (and will) happen during the above `list()` call.   So the question is, is `list()` doing or calling anything that touches GIL in some kind of a guaranteed way. Well, I don't know, really. I asked on #python if it will call some magic thread-safe method for converting keys to a list and no-one was aware of such a method. And I don't see the documentation mention anything like that. Even if this is safe and indeed not an implementation detail, I know I wouldn't want to rely on this behavior, anyway. This is too complicated! [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1710718/165157222-7d78f861-aa30-4bb6-b834-970a7ebab60a.png)  I am testing an addon for a Qt app that uses waitress internally. It launches it in a thread. This is [a patch I made](https://github.com/oakkitten/anki-connect/commit/6643dca83e197e7f2f3ca7d13e03a173c0e2c0d6) to fix the issue in a dumb way, which should be ok for tests. If you are willing, you can try grabbing the commit before that and running the tests (see tox.ini for instructions; the tests are slow and require a lot of dependencies so it won't be fun). The problem is rare, but you can force it by inserting some kind of a delay before the `select` call, then it manifests right away. |

| I spot that the description for [CVE-2022-31015](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f5x9-8jwc-25rw "CVE-2022-31015") mentions that this affects "versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1". However, a quick glance at the code suggests that this might be because it affects the `wasyncore` module which was [vendored in version 1.2](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/14778962fafb44bdd1c2ce1a163d197225a6508a). Does this issue, then, affect these older versions as well? Thanks. :) |

| I am facing this as well:  ``` import waitress from flask import Flask  app = Flask(__name__)  wsgi = waitress.create_server(app, host='0.0.0.0', port='1234') wsgi.run() ```  While the main loop is running, I am calling `wsgi.close()` from elsewhere, which yields:  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/myPath/./main.py", line 1368, in main     self.wsgi.run()   File "/myPath/lib/python3.11/site-packages/waitress/server.py", line 322, in run     self.asyncore.loop(   File "/myPath/lib/python3.11/site-packages/waitress/wasyncore.py", line 245, in loop     poll_fun(timeout, map)   File "/myPath/lib/python3.11/site-packages/waitress/wasyncore.py", line 172, in poll     r, w, e = select.select(r, w, e, timeout)               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor ```  Is there a recommended way of preventing this or handling it in a more clean way? Thanks! I'm using  ``` python3.11 waitress2.1.2  ``` |

Vendor asyncore into waitress as waitress.wasyncore. ([#199](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/199))

```
Waitress has now "vendored" asyncore into itself as ``waitress.wasyncore``.
This is to cope with the eventuality that asyncore will be removed from
the Python standard library in 3.8 or so.

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-f5x9-8jwc-25rw)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-f5x9-8jwc-25rw/dependabot)

## Package

pip

waitress
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 2.1.0, < 2.1.2

## Patched versions

2.1.2

## Description

### Impact

Waitress may terminate early due to a thread closing a socket while the main thread is about to call select(). This will lead to the main thread raising an exception that is not handled and then causing the entire application to be killed.

### Patches

This issue has been fixed in Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to close the socket, instead it is always delegated to the main thread.

### Workarounds

There is no work-around, however users using waitress behind a reverse proxy server are less likely to have issues if the reverse proxy always reads the full response.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues> (if not sensitive or security related)
* email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email).
