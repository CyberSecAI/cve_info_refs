  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists where a thread attempts to send data, but the socket is closed on the other end by another thread. This occurs because the WSGI thread can close the socket, while the main thread is about to call select() using that file descriptor. The main thread would then raise an exception, causing the entire application to terminate.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Race condition due to multiple threads accessing the socket descriptor.",
        "Uncaught exception in the main thread leading to process termination.",
         "Improper thread synchronization when closing sockets"
      ],
      "impact": "The application using Waitress may terminate abruptly, causing a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a thread attempts to send data to a socket that has been closed by another thread before the main thread calls select() on it.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker does not have to be in any specific position or need special capabilities to trigger the race condition. It can occur under normal operation, especially when the remote client closes the connection before reading the full response.",
       "additional_details": "The fix involves ensuring that the socket is only closed by the main thread. The WSGI thread will no longer be allowed to close the socket; it will instead delegate the task to the main thread via a trigger. This prevents the race condition where a thread closes the socket just before the main thread calls `select()` on it, which avoids the `OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor` exception. This also affects applications that uses waitress behind a reverse proxy server, where the proxy server is not reading the full response. The issue was introduced in version 2.1.0, when Waitress introduced the feature allowing WSGI threads to write directly to the socket."
