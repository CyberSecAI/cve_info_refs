# Missing brute force protection on cloud federation sharing

Low

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-2vwh-5v93-3vcq
Aug 4, 2022

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 22.2.9, < 23.0.6, < 24.0.2

## Patched versions

22.2.9, 23.0.6, 24.0.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker could brute force to find if federated sharing is being used and potentially try to brute force access tokens for federated shares (`a-zA-Z0-9` ^ 15).

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.9, 23.0.6 or 24.0.2.

### Workarounds

As a workaround federated sharing can be disabled in the Admin Sharing settings: `index.php/settings/admin/sharing`

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1596918)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31118
