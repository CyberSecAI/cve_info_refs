Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of brute-force protection in the cloud federation sharing feature of Nextcloud. Specifically, there was no throttling or rate limiting on requests related to federated sharing, which allows an attacker to repeatedly attempt actions and discover if federated sharing is being used and potentially try to brute force access tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Rate Limiting:** The primary weakness is the absence of rate limiting or brute-force protection mechanisms for requests concerning federated sharing.
- **Brute-Forceable Access Tokens**: The system did not properly protect against attempts to brute-force access tokens for federated shares (which are alphanumeric strings of length 15), making them vulnerable to guessing attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could discover if federated sharing is enabled on a Nextcloud instance.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By brute-forcing access tokens, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to federated shares.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the Nextcloud instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required to attempt brute-force attacks on the sharing endpoints.
- **Repeated Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send a large number of requests.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided content includes the fix commit which adds rate limiting (`throttle()`) to the error responses within `RequestHandlerController.php`. The commit details show that the fix includes adding a call to the throttle method in several catch blocks, specifically around the error responses. This helps to prevent a malicious actor from submitting requests at a high rate without some limitations.
-   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity, primarily because it requires a high attack complexity, likely due to the limited attack surface and the token length requiring large volumes of attempts to succeed.
-   The provided content links to both the security advisory and the pull request containing the fix, providing detailed context and remediation.
