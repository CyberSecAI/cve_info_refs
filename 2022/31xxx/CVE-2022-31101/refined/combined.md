So apparently there is unfiltered value returned by toLegacyOrderWay() (I'm doubt full of it see below)

If this is the case CHANGE the function, not simply one module otherwise it is an open door for other modules.

Why I'm doubtfull ? Because toLegacyOrderWay() calls getDirection() which return $this->direction. $this->direction is set by setDirection() (during construct) and tests are done against values asc, desc, random otherwise exception. How can this lead to sql injection

Sorry, something went wrong.

Therefore I repeat, the function that need to be patched SHOULD BE toLegacyOrderBy() that should implement the Validate::isOrderBy() before returning values.

Such way will protect ANY modules that use the framework function toLegacyOrderBy()

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
