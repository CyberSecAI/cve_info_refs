The provided content is related to CVE-2022-31386.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `getFileBinary` function in nbnbk CMS directly uses user-supplied input for the URL parameter in `file_get_contents` without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to the insecure use of user-supplied URLs with `file_get_contents`.
- The application can be tricked into making arbitrary requests to internal or external resources specified by the attacker.
- The application can be used to read arbitrary files from the server using `file://` URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary requests can be made from the server, potentially leading to data exfiltration or attacks on internal systems.
- Attackers can read local files from the server, gaining sensitive information.
- The application's functionality can be abused by making it query URLs specified by the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests by providing a malicious URL to the vulnerable `getFileBinary` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's endpoint. No specific authentication or elevated privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the server.
