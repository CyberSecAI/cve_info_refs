Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `live_mfg.shtml` page of the WAVLINK WN535 G3 router.
*   The page contains an `exec cmd` function which allows execution of arbitrary commands on the device.
*   Unauthorized users can access this page, which leads to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `live_mfg.shtml` page is accessible without authentication, allowing any user to access sensitive information.
*   **Command Injection:** The `exec cmd` function allows the execution of arbitrary system commands on the device.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain key information about the router (exact details not specified but include sensitive data).
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting arbitrary commands, attackers could potentially gain complete control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network access:** An attacker needs network access to the router's web interface, which is typically accessible on the local network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication or specific user privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes PoC screenshots demonstrating the access to the `live_mfg.shtml` page and the presence of the `exec cmd` functionality.
*   The router is WAVLINK WN535 G3, Firmware package version M35G3R.V5030.180927.
