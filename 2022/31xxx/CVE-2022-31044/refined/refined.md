- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Key Storage converter plugin mechanism was not enabled correctly in Rundeck versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. This resulted in the encryption layer for Key Storage potentially not working, leading to credentials being written in plaintext to the backend storage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Plaintext storage of keys and passwords due to a misconfigured storage converter plugin mechanism. The vulnerability is a result of a bug in the software that prevents the intended encryption mechanism from being used.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Credentials stored in Rundeck could be exposed in plaintext in the backend storage, if they were created or overwritten using vulnerable versions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker who gains access to the Rundeck backend storage can access the plaintext credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need access to the Rundeck backend storage, which could be through compromised database credentials or through some other vulnerability.
