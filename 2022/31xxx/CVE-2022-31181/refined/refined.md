Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a chain of two issues: a SQL Injection (CWE-89) followed by an Eval Injection (CWE-95).
*   The SQL injection vulnerability likely resides in how the application constructs and executes SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   The eval injection vulnerability arises because the application uses the results of the SQL query in a way that it can execute code from the SQL data. Specifically, the application was using the content of the smarty cache stored in the database in a way that allowed code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, likely due to improper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied data when constructing database queries.
*  **Eval Injection (CWE-95):** After the SQL injection, it was possible to execute PHP code in the context of the application via the `eval` function, by manipulating the database content.
*   The vulnerability chain is present because the application reads the content from the database, and then decrypts it before using it. The encryption key was not secret. Therefore if an attacker knows the encryption key it is possible to encrypt malicious code, store in the DB and execute it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this chain allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system, data breaches, or other malicious activities.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS metrics indicate high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, meaning that an attacker could potentially read all the data, modify all the data and prevent access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges to initiate the attack.
*   **Low attack complexity:** The attack complexity is considered low, meaning it doesn't require highly specialized knowledge or tools to exploit.
*   **No user interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerability affects PrestaShop versions >= 1.6.0.10.
*   The fix was implemented in version 1.7.8.7 by encrypting/decrypting the smarty cache using a secret key.
*   A workaround is provided: disabling the MySQL Smarty cache feature.

In summary, this CVE describes a critical vulnerability in PrestaShop resulting from a chain of SQL and Eval injection vulnerabilities. This combination allows a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server without any special privileges or user interaction.
