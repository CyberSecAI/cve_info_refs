Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `view_team.php` file within the Rescue Dispatch Management System v1.0. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter, allowing them to manipulate the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  The provided example demonstrates the ability to determine the database name (`rdms_db`) using the SQL injection vulnerability. This is achieved through a time-based technique, where the content length of the server response changes based on the truthiness of the injected SQL condition.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The vulnerability can potentially be used to read arbitrary data from the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary code on the server if the database user has sufficient privileges. The content only demonstrates information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a GET request to the vulnerable URL: `/rdms/admin/teams/view_team.php?id=`. The `id` parameter is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know or discover the vulnerable URL (`/rdms/admin/teams/view_team.php?id=`).
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a specific payload demonstrating the SQL injection: `1' and length(database()) = 7--+`. This payload is used to determine the length of the database name.
* The content shows how response length differs when the database name length is tested, which allows an attacker to infer the database name.
* The content provides credentials for backend login as: `admin/admin123` which could aid further attack if the SQLi vulnerability was not present.

The provided analysis goes beyond the CVE description by providing a specific vulnerable file and how to exploit it, including specific payload and observed content length changes.
