Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the insecure storage of passwords in the IDCE - MV Medicina Diagnóstica software. Specifically, the software stores user passwords in plaintext in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Plaintext Storage of Passwords (CWE-256, CWE-312):** Passwords are not encrypted or hashed before being stored in the database.
2.  **Weak Password Policy (CWE-521):** The application allows the use of very weak passwords, such as repeated numbers ("000"), and enforces all letters to be uppercase, which limits the entropy of passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Exposure of User Credentials:** If the database is compromised, attackers can easily read user passwords, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised user accounts could potentially be used to gain access to other systems or services within the organization's network.
*   **Data Breach:**  The software manages sensitive patient data, including medical records, financial information, and user permissions. A successful attack could expose this information, potentially violating regulations like LGPD.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a "Blind Time-Based" SQL Injection attack, which allows an attacker to read the database contents.
*   **Direct Database Access:** An attacker who gains access to the database, for example via a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration, can directly read the plaintext passwords.
*   **Network Access:** The application is sometimes exposed directly to the internet, increasing the attack surface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **SQL Injection Exploitation Skills:** Attackers need the ability to perform blind time-based SQL injection.
*   **Database Access:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability if they can directly access the database either through compromised credentials, internal network access or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** Network access to the vulnerable application, either locally or remotely.
*   **Persistence:** The attacker needs to maintain access long enough to extract data from the database.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was found in an older version of the IDCE - MV Medicina Diagnóstica software but some healthcare providers are still using unpatched, vulnerable instances.
*   The software manages sensitive information for hospitals and clinics, including patient medical records, user details, and financial data.
*   The vendor, MV Informática, was notified and claims to have fixed the issue in updated versions.
* The LinkedIn article mentions the ethical nature of collecting information, given the test environment and no exposure of private information.
