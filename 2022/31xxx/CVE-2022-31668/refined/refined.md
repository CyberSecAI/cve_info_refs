The provided content is related to CVE-2022-31671, not CVE-2022-31668. Therefore, I will extract information for CVE-2022-31671.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper user permission validation when updating p2p preheat policies. Specifically, the API call `PUT /projects/{project_name}/preheat/policies/{preheat_policy_name}` does not verify if the authenticated user has access to the project associated with the provided preheat policy ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate authorization checks when updating preheat policies.
- API endpoint allows modification of resources outside the user's authorized scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can modify p2p preheat policies configured in other projects, potentially disrupting operations or injecting malicious content into the preheat process of other projects that they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack via the API endpoint `PUT /projects/{project_name}/preheat/policies/{preheat_policy_name}`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to have a low privilege account with access to the Harbor instance
- Ability to make API calls.
- Attacker needs to know or guess the ID of the p2p preheat policy they want to modify.
