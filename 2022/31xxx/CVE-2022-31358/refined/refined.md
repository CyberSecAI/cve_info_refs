The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Proxmox VE and Proxmox Mail Gateway. Only one of the described vulnerabilties is related to the CVE provided.

**CVE-2022-31358: Post-auth XSS in API inspector**

*   **Root cause:** The server does not properly escape user input when generating the "breadcrumb" HTML of the navigation bar in the API inspector. The request path is directly concatenated to the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of input sanitization/escaping.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in user's browser session, gaining access to all functionalities of the web interface, including executing shell commands on the server.
*   **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious link containing HTML/JavaScript injection, and tricking a logged-in user to visit it.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user to visit a malicious link. The user also needs to be logged into the web interface in the same browser session where they visit the malicious link, since the authentication cookie `PVEAuthCookie` is set with the `Session` attribute.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more technical detail than the typical CVE description, including the vulnerable code snippets, steps to set up a debugging environment, and a proof of concept.
*   The article also details two other vulnerabilities that are not related to CVE-2022-31358: a CRLF injection in response headers and a Post-auth SSRF + LFI + Privilege Escalation vulnerability. These were later assigned CVE-2022-35507 & CVE-2022-35508.
