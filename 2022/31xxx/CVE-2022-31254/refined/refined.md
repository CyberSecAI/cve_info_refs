Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `rmt-server-regsharing.service` executes a rake task (`regsharing:sync`) using a bundled ruby environment located in `/usr/share/rmt/.bundle`.
- The `/usr/share/rmt` directory and its contents are owned by the `_rmt` user.
- This allows the `_rmt` user to modify the bundle configuration, specifically the `/usr/share/rmt/.bundle/config` file, or any files within the gem directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `_rmt` user has write access to the ruby bundle directory which is used by a root service. This allows the user to modify the execution environment of root processes.
- **Code Injection:** By modifying the gem files, the `_rmt` user can inject arbitrary code that will be executed with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with the privileges of the `_rmt` user can gain root access by injecting malicious code into the ruby bundle that is executed with root privileges when the `rmt-server-regsharing.service` runs.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute any code with root privileges.
- The impact is somewhat mitigated by systemd service hardening which mounts many directories as read-only.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system as the `_rmt` user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the privileges of the `_rmt` user on the affected system.
- The attacker needs the ability to modify files within `/usr/share/rmt/.bundle` directory structure.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `rmt-server-regsharing.service` which executes the command `bundle.ruby2.5 exec rake regsharing:sync`.
- The ruby bundle is located at `/usr/share/rmt/.bundle`.
- The `_rmt` user has write access to `/usr/share/rmt` and its subdirectories and files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The issue was fixed by updating the `rmt-server` package.
- Multiple SUSE products and versions were affected.
- The fix involves mitigating a packaging file issue that allowed for root escalation vector.
