# Public data export contains attachments that are non-public

Moderate

[alexmv](/alexmv)
published
GHSA-58pm-88xp-7x9m
Jul 12, 2022

## Package

Zulip Server
(Application)

## Affected versions

> 2.1.0, < 5.4

## Patched versions

5.4

## Description

### Impact

Since Zulip Server 2.1.0, administrators of Zulip organizations can [export public data](https://zulip.com/help/export-your-organization#export-of-public-data) from their organization via the organization settings menu. The exports include all the data that appears in public streams, and can be used to migrate from Zulip Cloud to self-hosting Zulip. Note that exporting *private* data is a separate process that requires command-line access to the Zulip server.

Due to a bug in the public export code, exports of public data contained *all* uploaded files, even those from private messages and private streams. This may have allowed organization owners or administrators to extract uploaded files that they were not otherwise allowed to access. The content of non-public messages was never included in public exports.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Data exported by Zulip Cloud organization administrators contained private files

  [![](/_astro/alex.rLi04l3I_ZS8spS.webp)](author/alex/)  [Alex Vandiver](author/alex/)   Jul 12, 2022 • 2 min read

Administrators of Zulip Cloud organizations can
[export public data](https://zulip.com/help/export-your-organization#export-of-public-data)
from their organization via the organization settings menu. The exports include
all the data that appears in public streams, and can be used to migrate from
Zulip Cloud to self-hosting Zulip. Note that exporting *private* data is a
separate process that requires contacting Zulip support.

Due to a bug in the public export code, exports of public data contained *all*
uploaded files, even those from private messages and private streams. This may
have **allowed organization owners or administrators to extract uploaded files**
that they were not otherwise allowed to access. The content of non-public
messages was never included in public exports.

This bug has existed since the public export feature was implemented in
August 2019. We have deleted all existing Zulip Cloud exports from our servers,
and will be making changes to auto-expire all exports after 7 days in the
future. This bug was fixed for self-hosted users in the
[Zulip Server 5.4 release](2022/07/12/zulip-server-5-4-security-release/).

We have notified by email all administrators and users in non-deactivated Zulip
Cloud organizations who may have been impacted by this bug. As many
organizations have never exported their data, most Zulip Cloud users were not
affected.

We would like to thank Antoine Benoist for bringing this issue to our attention.

# Zulip Server 5.4 security release

  [![](/_astro/alex.rLi04l3I_ZS8spS.webp)](author/alex/)  [Alex Vandiver](author/alex/)   Jul 12, 2022 • 2 min read

We released Zulip Server 5.4 today! This is a security release, containing a
security fix and several cherry-picked changes since Zulip Server 5.3.

## Upgrading

We recommend that all installations upgrade to this new release. See the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release)
in the Zulip documentation. If you need help, best-effort support is available
on [chat.zulip.org](https://zulip.com/development-community/).

## Notable changes

* CVE-2022-31134: Exclude private file uploads from
  [exports of public data](https://zulip.com/help/export-your-organization#export-of-public-data);
  see the [accompanying Zulip Cloud post](2022/07/12/zulip-cloud-data-exports/)
  for more details. We would like to thank Antoine Benoist for bringing this
  issue to our attention.
* Upgraded python requirements.
* Improved documentation for load balancers to mention CIDR address ranges.
* Documented an explicit list of supported CPU architectures.
* Switched `html2text` to run as a subprocess, rather than a Python module, as
  its GPL license is not compatible with Zulip’s.
* Replaced `markdown-include` python module with a reimplementation, as its GPL
  license is not compatible with Zulip’s.
* Relicensed as GPL the `tools/check-thirdparty` developer tool which verifies
  third-party licenses, due to a GPL dependency by way of `python-debian`.
* Closed a potential race condition in the Tornado server, with events arriving
  at exactly the same time as request causing server errors.
* Added a tool to help automate more of the release process.

## Community

We love feedback from the Zulip user community. Here are a few ways you can
