Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `inout Blockchain AltExchanger` platform. Specifically, user-controlled data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via three different parameters:
    1.  `symbol` parameter in `/application/third_party/Chart/TradingView/chart_content/master.php` (GET).
    2.  `marketcurrency` parameter in `/index.php/coins/update_marketboxslider` (POST).
    3.  `inoutio_language` cookie in `/index.php` (GET).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete disclosure of the database contents, including sensitive user data, transaction details, and potentially other sensitive application information.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify data within the database, leading to financial loss or manipulation of the exchange system.
- **System Compromise:** In some scenarios, SQL injection could also be used to gain unauthorized access to the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Non-Authenticated:**  The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely by attackers without requiring authentication.
- **HTTP GET/POST:** The attack vectors utilize HTTP GET requests (for `symbol` parameter and `inoutio_language` cookie) and HTTP POST requests (for `marketcurrency` parameter).
- **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** Exploitation is achieved through directly manipulating the values of vulnerable HTTP parameters or cookies with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** Attackers need to have some knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the structure of the SQL queries in the target application.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET and POST requests.
