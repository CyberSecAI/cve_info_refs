Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-31060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the exposure of banner topic data on pages that require user login. This means that even if a user is not logged in, they could still potentially access the banner data, which might contain sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is the unintentional disclosure of banner topic data to unauthenticated users on login-required pages.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:**  The application was not correctly checking user authentication status before displaying banner data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers could potentially access banner content intended only for logged-in users. This might reveal information that was not meant to be public. Although the severity is rated as "Low", the information exposed could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, or could provide unintended information to the public.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability could be exploited by simply visiting login-required pages without being logged in. No specific user action is needed besides visiting a login required page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special privileges:** An attacker does not need any specific permissions or elevated privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs only network access to the application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves modifying the `banner_json` method to return an empty JSON object if a user is not logged in and login is required.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Discourse versions:
    *   stable >= 2.8.4
    *   beta >= 2.9.0.beta5
    *   tests-passed >= 2.9.0.beta5
* The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
*   A workaround was provided to disable banners altogether to mitigate the issue until the application was updated.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `ae6a907`.
