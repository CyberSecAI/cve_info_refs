Welcome to OpenRemote; an intuitive user-friendly 100% open source IoT platform. You can build a complete IoT device management solution including: device management and auto provisioning, customisation of asset types, automation via when-then, flow, javascript and groovy rules, data analytics, connectivity via several protocol agents and manager APIs (e.g. MQTT broker, HTTP/REST, WS), Multi-tenancy (realms), Users and roles management, Edge gateway, Front-end UI web components and consoles, and an Insights dashboard builder.

As the code base is 100% open source, applications are limitless. Here's an architecture overview:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/24059ec559ae08bf9042eaf912534190aff6b7d0bc6ecb22a33777988deb6426/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e72656d6f74652e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032332f30392f4f70656e52656d6f74655f4172636869746563747572652d7363616c65642e6a7067)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/24059ec559ae08bf9042eaf912534190aff6b7d0bc6ecb22a33777988deb6426/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e72656d6f74652e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032332f30392f4f70656e52656d6f74655f4172636869746563747572652d7363616c65642e6a7067)

## Quickstart

You can quickly try the online demo with restricted access, login credentials are `smartcity:smartcity`:

[Online demo](https://demo.openremote.app/manager/?realm=smartcity)

The quickest way to get your own environment with full access is to make use of our docker images (both `amd64` and `arm64` are supported).

1. Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed (v18+).
2. Download the docker compose file:
   [OpenRemote Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openremote/openremote/master/docker-compose.yml) (Right click 'Save link as...')
3. In a terminal `cd` to where you just saved the compose file and then run:

```
    docker compose pull
    docker compose -p openremote up

```

If all goes well then you should now be able to access the OpenRemote Manager UI at <https://localhost>. You will need to accept the self-signed
certificate, see [here](https://www.technipages.com/google-chrome-bypass-your-connection-is-not-private-message) for details how to do this in Chrome (similar for other browsers).

### Login credentials

Username: admin

Password: secret

### Changing host and/or port

The URL you use to access the system is important, the default is configured as `https://localhost` if you are using a VM or want to run on a different port then you will need to set the `OR_HOSTNAME` and `OR_SSL_PORT` environment variables, so if for example you will be accessing using `https://192.168.1.1:8443` then use the following startup command:

BASH:

```
OR_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.1 OR_SSL_PORT=8443 docker compose -p openremote up -d

```

or

CMD:

```
cmd /C "set OR_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.1 && set OR_SSL_PORT=8443 && docker compose -p openremote up -d"

```

## What next

Try creating assets, agents, rules, users, realms, etc. using the Manager UI, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.openremote.io) for more information, some things to try:

* [Manager UI Guide](https://docs.openremote.io/docs/user-guide/manager-ui/) - Learn more about the User Interface
* [Creating an HTTP Agent tutorial](https://docs.openremote.io/docs/tutorials/open-weather-api-using-http-agent) - Connect to an online weather service
* [Custom Deployment](https://docs.openremote.io/docs/user-guide/deploying/custom-deployment) - Style the Manager to your brand
* [Setting up an IDE](https://docs.openremote.io/docs/developer-guide/setting-up-an-ide) - Set up your development environment
* [Working on the UI](https://docs.openremote.io/docs/developer-guide/working-on-ui-and-apps) - Create a web application compatible with OpenRemote
* [Creating a custom project](https://docs.openremote.io/docs/developer-guide/creating-a-custom-project) - Create a project with custom protocols, asset types and setup code

## Where's the data stored?

Persistent data is stored in a PostgreSQL DB which is stored in the `openremote_postgresql-data` docker volume which is durably stored independently of the running containers (see all with `docker volume ls`).
Note that historical attribute data is purged daily based on value of `OR_DATA_POINTS_MAX_AGE_DAYS`; this value can also be overridden for individual attributes by using the `dataPointsMaxAgeDays` configuration item.
See the [Developer Guide](https://docs.openremote.io/docs/developer-guide/useful-commands-and-queries/#backuprestore-openremote-db) for details on making backups of the database.

## Contributing to OpenRemote

For information and how to set up a development environment, see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.openremote.io/docs/category/developer-guide).

We work with Java, Groovy, TypeScript, Gradle, Docker, and a wide range of APIs and protocol implementations.

We follow the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) workflow with tags and releases for published versions of our components; when working on the codebase create descriptive branch names (e.g. `feature/cool_feature_x`, `hotfix/flux_capacitor`, `issue/123`, etc.).

When your changes are complete then create a Pull Request ensuring that your branch is up-to-date with the source branch and that code changes are covered by tests and that the full test suite passes.

I am trying to set up a Groovy Shell sandbox that can execute untrusted code. These untrusted codes are provided by the end users (developers) as behaviour configurations, e.g. how to determine if a person is high net worth. So, they really are part of the main program. I need to make sure that I am not vulnerable to any bad code [e.g. infinite loop]/hacks.

I understand that there are two things at play here:

1. The Java VM that provides the runtime.
2. The Groovy Shell that interprets and executes the code.

Are there best practices to sandbox a Groovy Shell?

Thanks

* You mean somewhere in a database or a conf file, a user enters `def isHighNetWorth(...) { ... }` and you'd like to read that from the db/conf and execute it?

I ended up creating a Policy file. Something like this:

```
grant codeBase "file:/your jar file" {
  permission java.security.AllPermissions;
}

grant codeBase "file:/groovy/shell" {
}

grant codeBase "file:/groovy/script" {
}

```

When Groovy is executed in interpreted mode, the codeBase is either `file:/groovy/shell` or `file:/groovy/script`. You can grant specific permission(s) for either context. These permissions (or lack thereof) are independent to what you give to your main program.

In addition to the policy file, there are many other considerations too.

1. What do you put into the evaluation context? If you put a 3rd party library, they may not even have the properly permission check in place.
2. Some System calls, say `System.out.println()` doesn't have permission check either. So, maybe you also need a source code checker (Jenkins does that).
3. To limit CPU, you may need to run the Groovy script in a separate thread.
4. You probably want to limit what a Groovy script can `import` too. This can be achieved with a Groovy `ImportCustomizer`.

I wrote an article: [Secure Groovy Script Execution in a Sandbox](https://chancharles.medium.com/secure-groovy-script-execution-in-a-sandbox-ea39f80ee87?source=friends_link&sk=8f53e562a4cfbbcb2239cf2f78d2fb36) to summarize my findings. I hope it will help others too.

* Limiting the imports is no use. You do not need to import a class to use it (neither in Java nor Groovy). Furthermore, Groovy provides some means of dynamically obtaining a reference, e.g., `String.class.forName('sun.misc.Unsafe')`.

* Running the script in a separate thread makes sense in general, but there is no way to limit resources (neither CPU nor memory).

Just relying on the Security Manager does not solve all the issues. There are multiple reasons why Security Manager is unsuited. Most importantly, it relies on the assumption that critical methods already incorporate the due permission checks. As already pointed out, this is not always the case. In the Java SE API alone, there are plenty of examples; expanding the scope to further 3rd party libraries, you will rarely see good implementations performing permission checks. This cannot be retrofitted. Security Manager was designed for protecting a desktop system; in contrast, on a multi-user system, you need additional protection against attacks on other users.

A working approach is what Jenkins does: intercept all method calls and member accesses and check against a configured whitelist. This is implemented in <https://github.com/jenkinsci/script-security-plugin>

A crucial thing here is how to maintain a usable whitelist. The Jenkins approach works with extensive lists of method signatures (plus blacklists). While this is a conservative approach, it's probably tedious to maintain. You should start with the smallest possible API subset that you want to offer. At best, there is a dedicated API for script users that hides all implementation details.

There are still some corner cases, in particular regarding resource exhaustion. Think for instance about the following script:

```
for( int x = 7; true; x *= x );

```

This infinite loop will keep the CPU busy while there is no method call or field assingment to be intercepted. IMHO, the best way to handle this would be to execute the script in a separate thread and stop it after a given timeout. Yes, I mean calling `Thread.stop()`, because interrupts will just be ignored. Finally, scripts may raise any `Throwable`, even checked ones whithout declaring them; you should always use `catch Throwable` around a script.

A bit more context would have been helpful, but given what you described:

I'd strongly recommend running groovyshell inside a container - one container per user/instance.

You can tightly control disk access, and also set a cap for CPU and memory usage of the container.

And if you want to go to the extreme, you can easily run each container in a network of its own with no other nodes and no internet access.

With that, the bad code will be quite restricted to docker vulnerabilities which can be exploited from a JVM program.

* Thanks for the response. I edited the question to give a bit more context: "...These untrusted codes are provided by the end users (developers) as behaviour configurations, e.g. how to determine if a person is high net worth. So, they really are part of the main program..." You have a point of running the GroovyShell inside a container. However, even so, I wouldn't want the container to be compromised.

[September 05, 2022](https://securityblog101.blogspot.com/2022/09/cve-2022-31860.html "permanent link")

An issue was discovered in OpenRemote through 1.0.4 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Groovy rule. Post disclosure, OpenRemote has restricted the affected functionality to specific user role (super users - https://github.com/openremote/openremote/pull/725), to potentially reduce risks regarding unrestricted Groovy rules.

**Details:**

The OpenRemote Platform has a functionality wherein users can create rules in 3 ways, namely, When-Then, Flow and Groovy.  Users can create rules by writing custom code in Groovy programming language. It is possible for a user of the platform to create a Groovy rule that executes arbitrary commands on the server hosting the OpenRemote platform. In the following PoC, we are trying to execute the "cat /etc/passwd" command on the hosting server and log the output of the command.

**Proof of Concept:**

def sout = new StringBuilder(), serr = new StringBuilder()

def proc = 'cat /etc/passwd'.execute()

proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)

CVE-2022-35136:  Boodskap IoT Platform v4.4.9-02 allows attackers to make unauthenticated API requests. CVE-2022-35135:  Boodskap IoT Platform v4.4.9-02 allows attackers to escalate privileges  via a crafted request sent to /api/user/upsert/<uuid>.  The platform successfully processes API requests even without valid cookies.For example, the following request to update user profile is processed, even though the request does not have any cookie/api key.

[October 12, 2022](https://securityblog101.blogspot.com/2022/09/cve-2022-34020.html "permanent link")

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in ResIOT ResIOT IOT Platform + LoRaWAN Network Server through 4.1.1000114 allows attackers to add new admin users to the platform or other unspecified impacts. ResIOT® IOT Platform + LoRaWAN Network Server (on-premise version) V.4.1.1000114  does not use any CSRF protection mechanism. It is possible for an attacker to launch CSRF attacks against users of the platform. An attacker can abuse CSRF to perform actions, such as creating a user on the platform. For this, the attacker can prepare a HTML form such as follows, host it online and send the form's link to a ResIoT admin user. <html>   <body>   <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>     <form action=" http://172.20.32.1: 8088/UserorgApi/?domain=172. 20.32.1&protocol=http:&email= test111@gmail.com&firstname= test&lastname=one&password= V79NrFNCAxZNXtg&phone= 77777777777 " method="POST...

Groovy adds the `execute` method to `String` to make executing shells fairly easy;

```
println "ls".execute().text

```

but if an error happens, then there is no resulting output. **Is there an easy way to get both the [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)) and [standard output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29)?** (other than creating a bunch of code to create two threads to read both inputstreams, using a parent stream to wait for them to complete, and then convert the strings back to text?)

It would be nice to have something like;

```
 def x = shellDo("ls /tmp/NoFile")
 println "out: ${x.out} err:${x.err}"

```

Ok, solved it myself;

```
def sout = new StringBuilder(), serr = new StringBuilder()
def proc = 'ls /badDir'.execute()
proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println "out> $sout\nerr> $serr"

```

displays:

`out> err> ls: cannot access /badDir: No such file or directory`

  In case you also need to set **Environment Variables** to this process, make sure to wrap the command in shell. For example, running a Perforce command with env vars: `envVars = ["P4PORT=p4server:2222", "P4USER=user", "P4PASSWD=pass", "P4CLIENT=p4workspace"]; workDir = new File("path"); cmd = "bash -c \"p4 change -o 1234\""; proc = cmd.execute(envVars, workDir);`

  @paul\_sns unrelated to the OP question, but I think modern JVMs handle uncontended synchronization just fine. So StringBuffer is unlikely to degrade performance in thread- or stack-confined scenarios .

  The docs say that we should be using waitForProcessOutput() - "To wait for the output to be fully consumed call waitForProcessOutput()". Source: [docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/…](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/Process.html#consumeProcessOutput(java.io.OutputStream,%20java.io.OutputStream))

  sout and serr might not be available even after the waitForOrKill. Tested using an assert instead of a println. Docs say: "For this, two Threads are started, so this method will return immediately. **The threads will not be join()ed, even if waitFor() is called**. To wait for the output to be fully consumed call waitForProcessOutput()."

`"ls".execute()` returns a `Process` object which is why `"ls".execute().text` works. You should be able to just read the error stream to determine if there were any errors.

There is a extra method on `Process` that allow you to pass a `StringBuffer` to retrieve the text: `consumeProcessErrorStream(StringBuffer error)`.

Example:

```
def proc = "ls".execute()
def b = new StringBuffer()
proc.consumeProcessErrorStream(b)

println proc.text
println b.toString()

```

I find this more idiomatic:

```
def proc = "ls foo.txt doesnotexist.txt".execute()
assert proc.in.text == "foo.txt\n"
assert proc.err.text == "ls: doesnotexist.txt: No such file or directory\n"

```

As another post mentions, these are blocking calls, but since we want to work with the output, this may be necessary.

To add one more important piece of information to the previous answers:

For a process

```
def proc = command.execute();

```

always try to use

```
def outputStream = new StringBuffer();
proc.waitForProcessOutput(outputStream, System.err)
//proc.waitForProcessOutput(System.out, System.err)

```

rather than

```
def output = proc.in.text;

```

to capture the outputs after executing commands in Groovy as the latter is a blocking call ([SO question for reason](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25300550/difference-in-collecting-output-of-executing-external-command-in-groovy)).

  I am really annoyed that a person took the time to give an answer and someone just downvoted it for no apparent reason. if this is a community, one should feel obligated to add a comment (unless it's a very obvious reason that any competent programmer would immediately see) explaining the downvote.

  @AmosBordowitz Lots of answers get downvotes. It's okay, it's one downvote. That said, it could be because it's code with no word of explanation -- not always well-received.

  @ChrisBaker so why not point it out? You yourself are not positive that this is the reason..

  @AmosBordowitz I am not the official downvote explainer, I cannot tell you why not, and it's understandable that I'm not certain since we're talking about an action taken by another individual. I offered one possibility. Why not explain the downvote, sure, why not explain the code in the answer? At any rate, I'm sure we'll all be okay.

  @ChrisBakerI never made any such claim ("but I guess you know better"). It's a decency thing, not a knowledge thing..

  `sh` is part of the Jenkins groovy DSL. Probably not useful here
