  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application was vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided data when displaying user profile titles and space names.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a stored XSS vulnerability in the user profile title field on the 'People' page and the space name display within membership and follow confirmation prompts.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need permissions to administer spaces to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to be able to modify user profile title fields or space names."
