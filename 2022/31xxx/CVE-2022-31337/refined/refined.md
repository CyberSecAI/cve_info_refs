The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Online Ordering System" by janobe.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/ordering/admin/category/index.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the attacker is able to identify the current database name (multistoredb).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/ordering/admin/category/index.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position is required but the attacker may need to have access to the admin panel to exploit the vulnerability.
