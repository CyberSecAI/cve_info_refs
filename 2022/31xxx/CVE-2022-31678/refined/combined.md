##### **1. Impacted Products**

* VMware Cloud Foundation (Cloud Foundation)

##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple vulnerabilities were privately reported to VMware. Updates are available to address this vulnerability in affected VMware products.

##### **3a. VMware Cloud Foundation update addresses a remote code execution vulnerability via XStream (CVE-2021-39144)**

**Description**

VMware Cloud Foundation contains a remote code execution vulnerability via XStream open source library. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Critical severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [9.8](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**

Due to an unauthenticated endpoint that leverages XStream for input serialization in VMware Cloud Foundation (NSX-V), a malicious actor can get remote code execution in the context of 'root' on the appliance.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2021-39144 apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

A supplemental FAQ was created for additional clarification. Please see: <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89932>

**Notes**

* While VMware does not mention end-of-life products on VMware Security Advisories, due to the critical severity of NSX-V the product team has made a [patch available](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4.14/rn/vmware-nsx-data-center-for-vsphere-6414-release-notes/index.html).
* VMware has confirmed that exploit code leveraging CVE-2021-39144 against impacted products has been published.
