The provided content describes four stored XSS vulnerabilities in the maccms8 project.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when adding video server groups and video players in the admin panel. Specifically, the `address` and `remarks` fields are vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users (typically administrators) when they view the affected pages, leading to potential compromise of the application or sensitive user data.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the application, specifically to video server groups and video player sections.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the privilege to add/edit video servers and players within the admin panel. The attacker injects XSS payloads into the `address` and `remarks` fields.
