- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic bug in Zulip Server where edited old messages in protected-history streams were incorrectly sent to new subscribers who shouldn't have access to those old messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper access control, specifically the failure to restrict the visibility of old messages to new subscribers in protected-history streams, leading to unintended exposure of message content.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Unauthorized disclosure of potentially sensitive message content to new stream subscribers who should not have access to old messages sent before their subscription.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation, as the server sends the incorrect API event to clients.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - High privileges: The attacker needs to be a user who is a member of the stream, and have the ability to edit old messages.
  - User interaction: The user needs to edit an old message to trigger the vulnerability.
  - The attacker needs to use a modified client or browser's developer tools to observe the API event, as official clients ignore the event.
