The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Simple Inventory System v1.0 by argie.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `/inventory/table_edit_ajax.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-provided data into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as the database name.
- This vulnerability could be leveraged for further malicious activities, such as reading arbitrary data from the database and potentially modifying or deleting data.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/inventory/table_edit_ajax.php` with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the application's structure to locate the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.
- The attacker has to be able to perform SQL injection to exploit the vulnerability.
