Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `semantic-release` tool was using `encodeURI()` to mask credentials in repository URLs. However, `encodeURI()` does not encode certain characters (e.g., `$` , `,`, `#`), which could be part of credentials. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization**: The vulnerability stems from using `encodeURI()` which doesn't encode all special characters.
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive information (credentials) can be exposed in the logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information (credentials) to unauthorized actors if the repository URL was modified to inject credentials and those credentials contained special characters not encoded by `encodeURI`.

**Attack vectors:**
- Modification of the repository URL to inject credentials that include characters not encoded by `encodeURI`. This would be in contexts where push access was not available by default.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to modify or influence the repository URL used by `semantic-release`.
- Knowledge of the specific characters not encoded by `encodeURI` that are present in the credentials.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented in version 19.0.3 involves using the original form of the repository URL, preventing the need to mask credentials using `encodeURI`.
- The vulnerability is limited to specific execution contexts where direct push access is not available and the repository URL must be modified to inject credentials.

This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2022-31051.
