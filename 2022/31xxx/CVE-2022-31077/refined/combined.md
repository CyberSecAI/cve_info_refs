# CloudCore CSI Driver: Malicious response from KubeEdge can crash CSI Driver controller server

Moderate

[kubeedge-bot](/kubeedge-bot)
published
GHSA-x938-fvfw-7jh5
Jun 24, 2022

## Package

gomod

KubeEdge
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=1.10.0, 1.9.2, 1.8.2

## Patched versions

1.11.0, 1.10.1, 1.9.3

## Description

### Impact

A malicious message response from KubeEdge can crash the CSI Driver controller server by triggering a nil-pointer dereference panic. As a consequence, the CSI Driver controller will be in denial of service. An attacker would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud, and only when the authenticated user launches the `csidriver` then CloudCore may be attacked.

### Patches

This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

### Workarounds

At the time of writing, no workaround exists.

### References

NA

### Credits

Thanks David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [kubeedge security policy](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/policy) during a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [KubeEdge repo](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/issues/new/choose)
* To make a vulnerability report, email your vulnerability to the private cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io list with the security details and the details expected for [KubeEdge bug reports](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).

**Notes:** This vulnerability was found by fuzzing KubeEdge by way of OSS-Fuzz.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31077
