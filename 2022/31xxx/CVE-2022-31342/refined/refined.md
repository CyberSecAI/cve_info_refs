```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows arbitrary file deletion via the `delete_img` function in `Master.php` due to insufficient path validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability",
    "Insufficient path validation",
    "Lack of access control on the delete_img function."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete any file on the server accessible by the webserver user, leading to data loss and potentially disrupting the application's functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `/ocwbs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img` with a `path` parameter specifying the file to delete.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker would need to know or be able to guess the path of the file they wish to delete."
