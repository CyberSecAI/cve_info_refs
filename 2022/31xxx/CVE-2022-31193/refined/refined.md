The provided content relates to CVE-2022-31193.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the JSPUI controlled vocabulary servlet of DSpace, where the `callerUrl` parameter was not properly validated, allowing for an open redirect.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an open redirect, specifically CWE-601. The `ControlledVocabularyServlet` in DSpace's JSPUI did not properly validate the `callerUrl` parameter. This allowed an attacker to provide an arbitrary URL, which the application would then redirect to after the legitimate DSpace request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could craft a malicious URL that appears to be a legitimate DSpace URL. When a user clicks on this URL, they are redirected to a site of the attacker's choice, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL using the `callerUrl` parameter within the DSpace application's JSPUI controlled vocabulary servlet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter. The attacker does not need any specific privileges or access other than being able to send requests to the application. The target user needs to click on the malicious link.
