Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-31196.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the application making an HTTP request to a URL provided by the user without proper sanitization or validation, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918)
- Lack of proper URL validation/sanitization for `jdbcDriverFileUrl`.
-  The application processes the response of the crafted URL in logs and also included in the response, leaking internal information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can trigger requests to arbitrary URLs by manipulating the `jdbcDriverFileUrl`.
- Attackers can potentially scan the internal network and identify internal services.
- Attackers can obtain the real IP address of the server hosting the application.
- The response of the crafted URL is logged, and included in the application's response, leaking internal information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A single HTTP POST request to create a `databaseType` with a malicious `jdbcDriverFileUrl`
- The `jdbcDriverFileUrl` can point to any URL

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `/api/v1.0/database_types` endpoint.
- No authentication or authorization requirements were mentioned in the vulnerability description.
