Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31068:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication when accessing refused inventory files in GLPI. Specifically, the `front/inventory.php` file allows retrieval of refused inventory files via the 'refused' parameter in the GET request without verifying user permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The core vulnerability is that the endpoint responsible for serving refused inventory files does not require authentication.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The refused inventory files might contain sensitive information, which can be accessed by unauthenticated users due to the lack of access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access refused inventory files, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information about the IT environment being managed by GLPI.
*   **Limited Availability:** Though not a primary impact, there is a low impact on availability. This may mean there is some form of denial of service possible, though the primary risk is data exposure.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is performed over the network using HTTP GET requests.
*   **Direct Request:** An attacker directly crafts a URL with the `refused` parameter and sends the request to the vulnerable endpoint `/front/inventory.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges on the GLPI system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the GLPI instance.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in GLPI versions 10.0.0 and above.
*   The fix was implemented in version 10.0.2.
*   The fix involves adding a session check `Session::checkRight("config", READ);` before allowing access to the refused inventory files.
*   A workaround is to comment out lines 47-56 of `front/inventory.php`.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 5.3, with vectors: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L, meaning network attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, unchanged scope, no confidentiality impact, no integrity impact and low availability impact.

This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).
