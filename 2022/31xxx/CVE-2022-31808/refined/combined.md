SUMMARY

SiPass integrated ACC (Advanced Central Controller) devices improperly sanitize user input on the telnet
command line interface. This could allow an authenticated user to escalate privileges by injecting arbitrary
commands that are executed with root privileges.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

ACC-AP (Advanced Central Controller) is a door controller for up to two doors connected to an Internet/In-
tranet network for communication with the SiPass integrated access control system.

AC5102 / ACC-G2 (Advanced Central Controller) is the central controller for SiPass integrated access
control systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-31808
