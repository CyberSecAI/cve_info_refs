- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVFLARE PKI implementation module uses `pickle` to transport CA credentials, which is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data using `pickle`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), and compromise of both confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: Network attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unprivileged network attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending maliciously crafted data to be deserialized.
