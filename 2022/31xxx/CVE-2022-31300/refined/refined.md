    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the application
    - Stealing of sensitive information
    - Other malicious actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the direct messaging feature of the application. An attacker can send a crafted message containing a malicious JavaScript payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
- They must be able to send direct messages to other users to trigger the vulnerability.
- An attacker can use tools like Burp Suite or browser developer tools to manipulate the request and inject the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected software is Haraj Script version 3.7, specifically the DM section.
- The exploit involves sending a request with a JavaScript payload, which is then stored and executed when a user views the message.
