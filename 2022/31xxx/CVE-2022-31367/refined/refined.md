Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **column name injection** in the filtering feature of the Strapi admin panel. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing database queries, leading to the injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. By manipulating the filter parameters, an attacker can inject arbitrary column names into the database query. Specifically, the `email_containss` parameter can be changed to `password_containss`, enabling the attacker to filter results based on password hashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Hash Disclosure:** An authenticated attacker with read access to user data can leverage this vulnerability to dump all available users' password hashes. This can lead to full account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Strapi admin panel's user filtering feature.
*   Specifically, the attacker manipulates the filter parameters in the HTTP request made when filtering user data.
*   The vulnerability occurs when filtering with "contains case sensitive" using the firstname and email fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with permission to read user data in the settings section of the Strapi admin panel.
*   **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to understand how the filter parameters are constructed and sent in the HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code (`exploit.py`) demonstrates how to automate the password hash leaking process. It uses the vulnerability to leak password hashes by iterating through possible characters and filters.
*   The vulnerability affects Strapi versions v3.\* and v4.\* prior to the fix. Specifically, fixed in v3.6.10 and v4.1.10.
*   The provided information gives explicit steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including how to modify the `email_containss` filter parameter to `password_containss` to expose the password hashes and further validates the bug by trying to filter with an invalid value for password.

**Summary of the provided information:**
The provided documents confirm that the vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability. The exploit is possible via the admin panelâ€™s filtering functionality. The content also provided a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and a Python exploit script, which are not found in the official CVE description.
