Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `mechanize` Ruby library not properly clearing the `Authorization` header when redirecting to a different port on the same host.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Header Leak:** The `Authorization` header, which may contain sensitive credentials, is inadvertently sent to a different port on the same host during a redirect.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information if the `Authorization` header contains credentials. This is because cookies are shared with a server at a different port on the same site, according to RFC6265. This means that a service running on a different port may also be able to read or write cookies from the original service. If security-sensitive information is stored in cookies, it is also exposed to the different port.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Redirection:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user is redirected to a different port on the same host.
- **Man-in-the-middle (possible):** If an attacker could somehow intercept traffic within the same host, they might be able to observe the leaked headers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to trigger a redirect:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the application using `mechanize` to redirect to a different port on the same host.
- **Potentially on same host:** The attacker might need to have a position to monitor traffic on the same host.
