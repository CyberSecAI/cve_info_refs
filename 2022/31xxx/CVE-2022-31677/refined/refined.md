- Root cause of vulnerability: A bug in the token exchange process where the expiration time of the submitted access token was not checked correctly. This allowed expired access tokens to be accepted until the user's backend session data was deleted (approximately nine hours after session start).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insufficient session expiration of access tokens. The access token's intended two-minute expiration was not enforced during token exchange, allowing the use of expired tokens.
- Impact of exploitation: A legitimate user could bypass the refresh checks performed against the external identity provider by maliciously skipping the refresh step. This could allow a user to retain access to Kubernetes clusters beyond the intended session duration, even if their account was locked or group memberships changed.
- Attack vectors: Network. An attacker with a valid, but potentially expired, access token can submit it to the Pinniped Supervisor's token exchange endpoint over the network.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be a legitimate user who has previously authenticated and obtained a valid access token and have the ability to skip the refresh process.
