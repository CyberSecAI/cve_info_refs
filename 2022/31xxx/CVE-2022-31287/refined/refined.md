The provided content relates to CVE-2022-31287.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an attempt to allocate an extremely large memory block (0xfffffffffffffffd bytes) in `AP4_RtpAtom::AP4_RtpAtom` when parsing an MP4 file. This is due to a malformed or crafted input file leading to the large allocation request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled memory allocation: The code attempts to allocate a size based on user-controlled data without sufficient validation which leads to the attempt to allocate a huge chunk of memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The large allocation request leads to a crash, due to AddressSanitizer detecting allocation size too big, which makes the application unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious MP4 file: A crafted MP4 file is used as input to the `mp42hls` tool, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application.
