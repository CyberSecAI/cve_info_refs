- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `cerdic/csstidy` third-party module used by the Nextcloud Mail app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated SSRF (CWE-918)
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Allows an unauthenticated attacker to send requests to arbitrary internal services, including those on the local network.
    - Enables attackers to probe internal network infrastructure (routers, other local services) to identify running services or router models by receiving and writing CSS files, potentially paving the way for further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted request to the Nextcloud server, which then processes a malicious CSS file by the `cerdic/csstidy` library, resulting in the server making the request to the attacker's desired location.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and does not need any privileged access to the Nextcloud server. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Nextcloud instance.
