# Octokit gem published with world-writable files

Low

[nickfloyd](/nickfloyd)
published
GHSA-g28x-pgr3-qqx6
Jun 15, 2022

## Package

bundler

octokit
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

4.23.0, 4.24.0

## Patched versions

4.25.0

## Description

### Impact

Versions [4.23.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.23.0) and [4.24.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.24.0) of the octokit gem were published containing world-writeable files.

Specifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem.

Malicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this package, could modify the gem’s files and change its behavior during runtime.

### Patches

* [octokit 4.25.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.25.0)

### Workarounds

Users can use the previous version of the gem [v4.22.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.22.0). Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31072

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

|  |  | # Validates the packed gem to determine if file permissions are correct. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <<'###SCRIPT\_COMMENT' |
|  |  | Purpose: |
|  |  | (Given octokit.rb is currently shipped "manually") |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Because different environments behave differently, it is recommended that the integrity and file permissions of the files packed in the gem are verified. |
|  |  | This is to help prevent things like releasing world writeable files in the gem. The simple check below looks at each file contained in the packed gem and |
|  |  | verifies that the files are only owner writeable. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Requirements: |
|  |  | This script expects that script/package, script/release or 'gem build \*.gemspec' have been run |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ###SCRIPT\_COMMENT |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | FILE=$(ls \*.gem| head -1) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | echo "\*\*\* Validating file permissions in the octokit gem \*\*\*" |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | if [ ! -f "$FILE" ]; then |
|  |  | echo "$FILE does not exist. Please run script/package, script/release or 'gem build \*.gemspec' to generate the gem to be validated" |
|  |  | echo -e '☒ failure' |
|  |  | exit 1 |
|  |  | fi |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | tar -xf "${FILE}" |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # naive check to quickly see if any files in the gem are set to the wrong permissions |
|  |  | for f in $(tar --numeric-owner -tvf data.tar.gz ) |
|  |  | do |
|  |  | if [ $f == "-rw-rw-rw-" ]; then |
|  |  | echo "World writeable files (-rw-rw-rw- | 666) detected in the gem. Please repack and make sure that all files in the gem are owner read write ( -rw-r--r-- | 644 )" |
|  |  | echo -e '☒ failure' |
|  |  | rm -f checksums.yaml.gz data.tar.gz metadata.gz |
|  |  | exit 1 |
|  |  | fi |
|  |  | done |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # Check clean up |
|  |  | echo -e '☑ success' |
|  |  | rm -f checksums.yaml.gz data.tar.gz metadata.gz |
