The content is related to CVE-2022-31072.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the octokit gem being published with world-writable files. Specifically, the files within the gem were packaged with permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (0666) instead of the intended `rw-r--r--` (0644).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- World-writable file permissions on files included in the gem package.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious code, if present on the system where the vulnerable gem is installed, could modify the gem's files, potentially changing its behavior at runtime.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application using the gem.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to have existing access to the system where the vulnerable gem is installed.
- The attacker would then be able to modify the gem's files because of the world-writable permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a foothold or some form of access to the system where the vulnerable gem is installed.
-  The attacker must have the ability to write to files in the system.
