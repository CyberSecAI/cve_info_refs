### @harshavardhana **[harshavardhana](/harshavardhana)** commented [May 28, 2022](#issue-1251747567)

## Description

fix: add timeouts to avoid goroutine leaks in net/http

## Motivation and Context

Following code can reproduce an unending go-routine buildup,

while keeping connections established due to lack of client

not closing the connections.

<https://gist.github.com/harshavardhana/2d00e6f909054d2d2524c71485ad02e1>

Without this PR all MinIO deployments can be put into

denial of service attacks, causing the entire service to be

unavailable.

We bring in two timeouts at this stage to control such

go-routine build-ups, new change

* IdleTimeout (to kill off idle connections)
* ReadHeaderTimeout (to kill off connections that are too slow)

This new change also brings two hidden options to make any

additional relevant changes if desired in some setups.

## How to test this PR?

Test with the `gist` shared with the latest master and observe

the connection build-up locally, this can be reproduced with

single MinIO running.

This eventually causes all incoming API calls to slowdown

or not respond - eventually requiring MinIO service to be

restarted.

## Types of changes

* Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
* New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
* Optimization (provides speedup with no functional changes)
* Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

## Checklist:

* Fixes a regression (If yes, please add `commit-id` or `PR #` here)
* Documentation updated
* Unit tests added/updated

Sorry, something went wrong.

I don't see it being applied. PTAL.

Limits looks good. It is virtually impossible to protect against this type of attacks at this level. It just takes a trivial bump in attack rate to get around this.

But whatever we do, there are still slow-lorris attacks which can eat up connections. Virtually impossible to guard against, though it will require authentication.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Virtually impossible to guard against, though it will require authentication.  It does the total connection build up becomes lower automatically, they grow up to some value and then taper off.  However yes there is just no way in reality to have this to some extent. That's why it's configurable as a hidden value. |

| [@klauspost](https://github.com/klauspost) correct I meant to keep these as reasonable protection, of course you can basically make enough fast connections before server considers them idle - timeouts a bloody game :-) |

# Possible DDOS by establishing keep-alive connections with anonymous HTTP clients

High

GHSA-qrpr-r3pw-f636
Jun 3, 2022

## Package

gomod

minio
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z

## Patched versions

RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z

## Description

### Impact

Following code can reproduce an unending go-routine buildup while keeping connections

established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections.

<https://gist.github.com/harshavardhana/2d00e6f909054d2d2524c71485ad02e1>

Public-facing MinIO deployments are most affected however, there are different workarounds available.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z

### Workarounds

A workaround is by using a reverse proxy to limit the number of connections being attempted in front of MinIO, and actively rejecting connections from such malicious clients.

### References

Pull request [#14995](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/14995) describes, what we had to bring in to facilitate control over such malicious HTTP client behavior
