Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** in the `delete_post()` function within the `/odfs/classes/Master.php` file. This function allows users to delete posts by directly referencing their IDs without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **IDOR:** The application uses the post ID directly from user input to delete posts without verifying if the user has the right to delete that specific post.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** There are no authorization checks to ensure that the user requesting the deletion is either the author of the post or an administrator with the necessary permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Post Deletion:** Any authenticated user, even one who did not create the post, can delete any post by providing its ID. This can lead to data loss and manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct manipulation of POST request:** An attacker can craft a POST request to `/odfs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_post` with the `id` parameter set to the ID of the post they wish to delete. This request can be sent by using a simple HTML form, or via other tools such as curl.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have an account on the forum to access and use the vulnerable delete functionality.
*   **Knowledge of Post IDs:** An attacker needs to know or discover the IDs of the posts they wish to delete.
*   **Network access:** An attacker needs network access to submit HTTP requests.

**Additional notes:**
*   The provided github content includes a proof of concept HTML form to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The source code for the affected application is available on sourcecodester.com
*   Several users have reported issues with the login functionality of the application.
