- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap buffer overflow due to out-of-bounds access in the `get_charset` function within `ftbench.c`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer underflow leading to negative index.
    - Out-of-bounds write due to incorrect indexing of the `charset->code` array.
    - The `face->num_glyphs` can be zero, which leads to `first_index` and `last_index` being -1.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A heap buffer overflow can lead to denial of service, code execution, or other undefined behavior. Specifically, it is crashing the application.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - By providing a specially crafted font file or glyph data that sets `face->num_glyphs` to zero.
    - Running `ftbench -c 1 ./poc` where `poc` is a malicious font.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to provide a malicious font that triggers the condition `face->num_glyphs` is zero.
    - The attacker needs to execute the `ftbench` with a crafted font, which triggers the vulnerability.
