```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The 'live_check.shtml' page in WAVLINK WN535 G3 firmware allows unauthorized access to sensitive router information by executing the 'exec cmd' function.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Information disclosure vulnerability: Unauthorized users can access key router information.
- Command execution: The presence of 'exec cmd' function execution within the 'live_check.shtml' page without proper access control

Impact of exploitation:
Unauthorized users can obtain sensitive router information. This could lead to further exploitation, like gaining access to administrative interface or network information.

Attack vectors:
Accessing the 'live_check.shtml' page via HTTP without authentication.
The specific vulnerable URL is http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/live_check.shtml, where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the router's IP address.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router and does not require authentication.
