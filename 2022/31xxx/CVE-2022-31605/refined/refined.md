- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the usage of `yaml.load()` instead of `yaml.safe_load()` when loading YAML files. This allows for arbitrary code execution by deserializing untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe deserialization of YAML data using `yaml.load()`. This is a classic vulnerability where arbitrary code can be executed during the deserialization process if the YAML file contains malicious content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), and compromise of confidentiality and integrity of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A network attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious YAML files to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unprivileged network attacker is able to exploit this vulnerability. No prior access to the system is required.
