{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the PATH_INFO, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the proof-of-concept demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability using `waitfor delay`. This can be used to infer information based on response times.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious payload injected into the PATH_INFO part of the URL"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.",
    "additional_information": "The provided PoC uses a `waitfor delay` to demonstrate the time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability, this is a method to infer information by observing the delay in server responses. The affected product is IdeaTMS version 2022."
