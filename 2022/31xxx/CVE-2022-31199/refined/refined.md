Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insecure object deserialization issue due to an unsecured .NET remoting service listening on TCP port 9004. This service allows the submission of arbitrary objects without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure Object Deserialization (CWE-502)
- Unsecured .NET Remoting service accessible on TCP port 9004

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the Netwrix Auditor server with the privileges of the affected service (UAVRServer.exe)
- Potential compromise of the Active Directory domain, as the service typically runs with high privileges
- Complete compromise of the Netwrix server as the command was executed with `NT AUTHORITY\system` privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack through TCP port 9004
- Exploiting the unsecured .NET remoting service (`UAVRServer` endpoint)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the target server on TCP port 9004
- Ability to craft and send malicious, serialized .NET objects to the vulnerable service

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was identified by performing a TCP port scan using nmap, which revealed the exposed .NET remoting service.
- The `ysoserial.net` tool was used to generate a serialized payload.
- The `ExploitRemotingService` tool was used to send the payload.
- The exploit was demonstrated by executing the `whoami` command which revealed the vulnerability allows code execution with `NT AUTHORITY\`system privileges.
- The affected product is Netwrix Auditor, in supported versions prior to 10.5.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-31199.
