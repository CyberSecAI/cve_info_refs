| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1204696#c0)  Filippo Bonazzi   2022-10-25 09:54:37 UTC  ``` During a sendmail audit, a mail to root privilege escalation was found in a SUSE-specific script.  /usr/lib/systemd/system/sendmail-client.service -----------------------------------------------     credentials: root:root     ExecStartPre=-/etc/mail/system/sm-client.pre     ExecStart=/usr/sbin/sendmail $SENDMAIL_CLIENT_ARGS     ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID  runs sm-client.pre as root. This script creates a pidfile in /var/spool/clientmqueue/sm-client.pid, then chowns it to mail:mail. The directory is owned by mail:mail, which can then easily perform a symlink attack to obtain root. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1204696#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2022-10-25 13:37:15 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-31256 for this ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1204696#c2)  Thomas Leroy   2022-10-26 08:04:37 UTC  ``` Affected: - SUSE:SLE-12:Update - SUSE:SLE-15:Update  SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update doesn't contain the script ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1204696#c4)  Filippo Bonazzi   2022-10-26 08:29:21 UTC  ``` Setting bug to public since fixes are already in OBS (SR#1031106) and issue is not so severe. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1204696#c5)  Thomas Leroy   2022-10-26 08:42:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas Leroy from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1204696#c2)) > Affected: > - SUSE:SLE-12:Update > - SUSE:SLE-15:Update >  > SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update doesn't contain the script  Hi Werner, could you also please fix these? :) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1204696#c6)  Dr. Werner Fink   2022-10-26 08:43:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Filippo Bonazzi from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1204696#c4)) > Setting bug to public since fixes are already in OBS (SR#1031106) and issue > is not so severe.
