Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-31089:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of certain types of invalid file requests within the `parse-server`. Specifically, requests with invalid application IDs or file paths were not being processed correctly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The server was crashing when it received specific invalid file requests rather than handling them gracefully. This indicates a lack of proper input validation and error handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could crash the `parse-server` by sending malicious requests.
  - For single-instance deployments of Parse Server without redundancy, this would lead to a high impact on availability and cause complete downtime.
  - For multi-instance deployments, the impact may be lower but would depend on the configuration of the cluster.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based attacks:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by sending crafted HTTP requests to the file server endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to send network requests to the server and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints in `parse-server`. No user interaction or authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- **Patched Versions:**
  - The vulnerability is addressed in versions `4.10.12` and later for the 4.x branch and `5.2.3` and later for the 5.x branch.
- **Mitigation:** The fix involves ensuring that invalid requests are properly handled, likely by adding input validation and error handling in the `FilesRouter`.
- **CVSS Score:** The provided CVSS score is 7.5 (High), with an attack vector of network, low complexity, no privileges required and high availability impact which accurately reflects the severity of the issue
- **Specifics of the fix:**
    - The fix introduces checks for invalid app IDs.
    - It ensures that invalid file paths don't cause the server to crash.
    - The vulnerability was triggered both in file requests and metadata requests.
