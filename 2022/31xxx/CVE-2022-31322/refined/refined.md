  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the presence of a SUID-enabled file moving utility (`conf_mover` or `confMover`) that does not properly sanitize its inputs, allowing a local, unprivileged user to overwrite any file on the system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of the file paths in the SUID utility.",
      "Insecure use of SUID bit in file-moving utility."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root by overwriting arbitrary system files, leading to a full compromise of the WAPPLES device.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local, unprivileged user can utilize the vulnerable `conf_mover` or `confMover` utilities to overwrite any system file on the system, thus gaining root privileges.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have local, unprivileged access to the system running the vulnerable WAPPLES software. This could be achieved via the backdoor account or through the CouchDB RCE."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Penta Security WAPPLES versions 5.0.12.* and 6.0.*"
