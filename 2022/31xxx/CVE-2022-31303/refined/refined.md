  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the admin panel's server group configuration, leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the admin panel. This code executes in the context of the victim's browser session, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or manipulating data within the application's admin interface.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered through the admin panel's 'video' -> 'server groups' -> 'add' functionality, specifically by injecting malicious javascript into the 'name', 'server group address', 'sort', or 'prompt' input fields."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the application's admin panel to inject the malicious scripts."
