The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Car Wash Booking System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `delete_booking` function in `Master.php`, specifically in the handling of the `id` parameter. User-supplied input for the booking ID is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it constructs SQL queries by concatenating user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration: Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including database names, table structures, and data.
- Data manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data.
- Potential compromise of the application: By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker can potentially gain control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is exploited through a POST request to the `/ocwbs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_booking` endpoint.
- Malicious payload in the 'id' parameter:  The attacker injects a malicious SQL query within the `id` parameter such as `' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques.
- Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (optional, can also be achieved using tools like Burp Suite).
