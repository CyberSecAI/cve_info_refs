- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CODESYS Gateway Server V2 does not sufficiently verify the specified password during login, leading to partial string comparison.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-187: Partial String Comparison. The vulnerability allows authentication with a shorter password than the configured one.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can send crafted requests to the CODESYS Gateway Server V2 over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the CODESYS Gateway Server V2. No prior authentication is required.
