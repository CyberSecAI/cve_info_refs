- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the way InstallBuilder for Qt Windows installers load DLLs when displaying popups (dialog actions). Specifically, the installer tries to load DLLs from the parent directory of the installer binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DLL hijacking vulnerability. The installer loads DLLs from an insecure location (the parent directory of the installer), which can be manipulated by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can plant a malicious DLL in the installer's parent directory, which the installer will load when a popup is triggered. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the ability to plant a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to the parent directory of the vulnerable installer on the target machine to plant the malicious DLL.
