The provided content relates to CVE-2022-31113.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the history page of triggered Canarytokens. This was due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data displayed on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of a Canarytoken's history page when it is visited by the Canarytoken's creator.
- This could lead to:
    - Disabling or deleting the affected Canarytoken.
    - Viewing its activation history.
    - Potentially revealing the creator's email address, network location, or other sensitive information.
    - Redirecting the creator to attacker-controlled resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to recognize an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL).
- The attacker then needs to trigger the Canarytoken.
- The vulnerability is then triggered when the creator views the history page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the Canarytoken.
- The attacker does not require any privileges on the system.
- The attack requires user interaction (the victim needs to visit the history page).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is patched in commit `sha-dc37895` by encoding the 'info' variable via `{{info|e}}` in `templates/history.html`.
- The vulnerability is rated as Moderate with a CVSS score of 6.3.
- The commit diff shows that the fix was applied by adding the `|e` filter which escapes the data before rendering it on the page, thus mitigating the XSS vulnerability.
