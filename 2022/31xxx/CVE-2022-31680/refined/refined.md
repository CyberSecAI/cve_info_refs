Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-31680:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data in the Platform Services Controller (PSC) component of VMware vCenter Server. Specifically, the `getDataByConstraint` function within the `DataAccessController` deserializes a `Constraint` object from a Base64 encoded string provided in the URL without proper validation or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The application deserializes a Java object from user-controlled input without proper checks, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized data.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the type or content of the deserialized object, permitting the instantiation of arbitrary classes.
- **Use of `JBossObjectInputStream`:** The use of `JBossObjectInputStream` makes the application susceptible to deserialization attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution on the underlying operating system hosting the vCenter Server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Attackers could potentially gain full control of the vCenter Server, impacting all managed virtual machines and ESXi hypervisors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/psc/data/constraint/{constraintBlob}` endpoint, where `{constraintBlob}` contains the malicious serialized data encoded with Base64.
- **Post-Authentication:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to vCenter Server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must possess valid administrative credentials for the vCenter Server to initiate the malicious request.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vCenter Server.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability only affects vCenter Server 6.5 with an external PSC.
- vCenter Server versions 6.7 and 7.0 are not affected.
- The vulnerability was reported by Marcin "Icewall" Noga of Cisco Talos.
-  The fix for this issue is included in vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3u.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSSv3 base score of 7.2.

**Summary of Affected Product and Fixed Version:**

| Product | Version | Fixed Version |
|---|---|---|
| vCenter Server | 6.5 | 6.5 U3u |
