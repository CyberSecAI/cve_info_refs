# Remote code execution in Indy-Node's pool-upgrade transaction

Critical

[WadeBarnes](/WadeBarnes)
published
GHSA-r6v9-p59m-gj2p
Sep 2, 2022

## Package

indy-node
(Hyperledger)

## Affected versions

<=1.12.4

## Patched versions

>=1.12.5

## Description

### Impact

The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node `<=1.12.4` allows an improperly authenticated attacker to remotely execute code on nodes within the network.

Network operators are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest Indy-Node release `>=1.12.5` as soon as possible.

### Patches

The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node `>=1.12.5` has been updated to properly authenticate `pool-upgrade` transactions before any processing is performed by the request handler. The transactions are further sanitized to prevent remote code execution.

### Mitigations

Network operators are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest Indy-Node release `>=1.12.5` as soon as possible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
