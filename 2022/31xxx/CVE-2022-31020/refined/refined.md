Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node, which, in versions `<=1.12.4`, does not properly authenticate `pool-upgrade` transactions before processing them. This lack of authentication, combined with insufficient input sanitization, allows for remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication:** The `pool-upgrade` request handler does not properly verify the authenticity of the upgrade transactions.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The package name to be upgraded is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on nodes within the network by crafting a malicious `pool-upgrade` transaction.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to full compromise of the affected nodes, allowing attackers to steal data, disrupt services, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Indy-Node network.
*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Indy-Node version `>=1.12.5`.
*   The `pool-upgrade` request handler was updated to properly authenticate transactions and sanitize inputs, preventing remote code execution.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed by [@shakreiner](https://github.com/shakreiner) of CyberArk Labs.

**Summary of changes:**

The commit `fe507474f77084faef4539101e2bbb4d508a97f5` modifies `indy_common/util.py` to sanitize command input to remove command chaining via characters such as `;`, `&&` and `|` and also applies similar sanitization to the `indy_node/server/request_handlers/config_req_handlers/pool_upgrade_handler.py` file
