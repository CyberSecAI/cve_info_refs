Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the inadequate authorization checks within the Jeg Elementor Kit plugin's functions that handle plugin settings updates. Specifically, the plugin uses a nonce that is accessible to unauthenticated users through pages edited by the plugin, allowing them to bypass authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authorization bypass. Unauthenticated users can exploit the easily obtainable nonce to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators.
*   **Insecure Nonce Handling:** The plugin does not properly validate the nonce, making it susceptible to unauthorized access. The nonce is not tied to user sessions and can be reused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to:

*   **Modify MailChimp API Key:** An attacker can change the MailChimp API key, which could allow them to steal mailing lists or send malicious emails.
*   **Change Global Styles:** An attacker can modify the global styles, potentially causing design issues or introducing malicious content.
*   **Modify 404 Page Settings:** An attacker can change the 404 page settings, possibly redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying malicious content.
*   **Enable/Disable Elements:** An attacker can enable or disable various elements of the plugin, disrupting website functionality or disabling security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be performed over the network by crafting malicious requests to the plugin's AJAX endpoints.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users, meaning no prior access to the website is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the plugin's AJAX endpoints for the actions they intend to perform.
*   **Nonce Extraction:** The attacker needs to extract the nonce from the HTML source of pages edited by the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.5.7 of the Jeg Elementor Kit plugin.
*   The Wordfence vulnerability database entry confirms the vulnerability and provides a CVSS score of 8.6 (High).
*   The provided Trac log shows the changes made to fix this vulnerability including improved nonce handling by adding context to the nonce and checking user capabilities in ajax callback.
*   The analysis also indicates that the mailchimp API key is now validated using the API.
