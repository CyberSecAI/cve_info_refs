Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-3783 (based on the provided issue and commit details)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of user-provided input in the `ui_text` node of the Node-RED dashboard. Specifically, the application was using `$interpolate` to process user-provided format strings for text, label, tooltip, color, icon, and units fields, without proper sanitization. This allowed for the injection of JavaScript code via template literals.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious JavaScript code within the format string, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser when the dashboard is viewed. The vulnerability was present in the handling of text, label, tooltip, color, icon, and units fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, potentially leading to:
  - **Data theft:** Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information related to Node-RED or the user's browser
  - **Session hijacking:** Taking over the user's session and performing actions on their behalf.
  - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the dashboard.
  - **Malicious Redirects:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites
  - **Other attacks:** Conducting further attacks on the user's system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-Supplied Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the format, label, tooltip, color, icon, or units fields of a `ui_text` node. This is done through the Node-RED UI when editing the text node.
- **Data Injection:**  Specifically, the attacker injects template literal strings, like `{{constructor.constructor('alert(document.cookie)')()}}` into the text node's settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Node-RED Editor:** The attacker needs to have access to the Node-RED editor to be able to create or modify a text node.
- **Understanding of Template Literals:** The attacker needs to know how to inject JavaScript code using template literals.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Component:** The `ui_text` node within the `node-red-dashboard` package.
- **Affected versions:** Versions prior to the fix. The fix was introduced in version 3.1.9.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was mitigated by adding checks that prevent the use of the "constructor" keyword in format strings, effectively blocking the primary attack vector.
