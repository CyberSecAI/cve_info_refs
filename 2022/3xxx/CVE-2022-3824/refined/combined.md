## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Admin UI Customize < 1.5.13 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "WP Admin UI Customize" » "Login Form".
2. Enter the following value in the first four input boxes: 123" onmouseenter=alert(/XSS/) ".
3. Click the 'Save' button on the page.
4. Refresh or re-enter the page and move the mouse over the input box to get the XSS to trigger.

### Affects Plugins
