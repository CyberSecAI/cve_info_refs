- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious scripts that execute when a user interacts with the affected settings. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to access the plugin settings page and inject a malicious script into specific input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin-level privileges or other high privileges within the WordPress installation to access and modify the plugin settings. The exploit requires user interaction (mouse over the input box) to trigger the XSS.
