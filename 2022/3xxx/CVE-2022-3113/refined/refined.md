Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check of the return value of `devm_kzalloc()` in the `mtk_vcodec_fw_vpu_init()` function within the Linux kernel's MediaTek video codec driver. `devm_kzalloc()` is used to allocate memory. If the allocation fails, it returns `NULL`. Without a check for this `NULL` return, the code proceeds to dereference the pointer, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the code attempts to access memory via a pointer that could be `NULL` when memory allocation fails.
- **Missing Error Handling:** The lack of a check for the return value of `devm_kzalloc()` represents a missing error handling case. This means that if the memory allocation fails, the program attempts to use the resulting `NULL` pointer, which will crash the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic/System Crash:** A NULL pointer dereference in the kernel leads to a kernel panic and a system crash. This means an attacker could potentially cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the video codec driver. If a user or process triggers the `mtk_vcodec_fw_vpu_init()` function in a way that causes memory allocation to fail, a NULL pointer dereference would occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with or trigger the video codec driver in a way that would cause `devm_kzalloc()` to fail and return `NULL`, triggering the vulnerability. This could involve manipulating media files or other resources related to video processing on a system using the vulnerable driver.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `drivers/media/platform/mtk-vcodec/mtk_vcodec_fw_vpu.c`.
- The fix involves adding a check for the return value of `devm_kzalloc()`. If the allocation fails, the function now returns an error, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.
- The fix was introduced in commit `e25a89f743b18c029bfbe5e1663ae0c7190912b0` in the Linux kernel and the fix is in version 5.18-rc1
- The affected kernel version is before the fix, specifically through 5.16-rc6.
