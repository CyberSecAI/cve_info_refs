- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An undocumented configuration interface exists in the WAGO Unmanaged Switch (852-111/000-001).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Hidden Functionality (CWE-912): The presence of an undocumented configuration interface.
    - Lack of Authorization: The interface can be accessed without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Confidentiality Violation: Attackers can read system information.
    - Network Configuration Changes: Attackers can configure network settings.
        - Violating confidentiality of transferred network packets (if not encrypted).
        - Violating the availability of network clients (e.g. by deactivating network ports).
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable device. No prior privileges or user interaction is required.
