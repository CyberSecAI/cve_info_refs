The provided content discusses a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function of the "crm42" application. This information aligns with the characteristics of a typical CVE involving SQL injection.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the login function of the crm42 application. User-provided input for username and password fields is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection due to the insecure construction of the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials and other data.
- Data Manipulation: The attacker could potentially alter or delete data within the database.
- Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation could lead to the attacker gaining elevated privileges within the application or even on the system.
- Denial of Service: It's possible, although not explicitly mentioned, that a carefully crafted injection could cause a denial of service by overloading or disrupting the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login form.
- Specifically, the vulnerability exists within the handling of the username and password fields in the login form, which can be manipulated via HTTP POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit requests to the login form, typically through a web browser or other HTTP client.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL to craft malicious SQL payloads.
- The attacker does not necessarily need prior access or credentials to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, as it can be exploited during the login process itself.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is located in `crm42\class\class.user.php` lines 920-922.
- The application uses PHP 5.5.9 and MySQL 5.1.60.
- The exploit can be validated with sqlmap, an automated SQL injection testing tool.
- Manual SQL injection examples are given, such as obtaining database version and current user.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) HTTP POST request is included, demonstrating the SQL injection attack.
