{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `g_file_set_contents` function in GLib does not preserve the permissions of the file when writing to it, effectively overwriting any prior permission settings. Specifically, it uses a hardcoded 0666 mode, which is not desired when creating a config file with sensitive data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a permission issue. While the code attempts to set the file permissions to 0660 before saving the file, the underlying `g_file_set_contents` function resets the permissions to 0666. This means that after saving the file, any user on the system might be able to read sensitive data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially read sensitive information stored in the configuration file such as the Redfish passwords. This would allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system being managed by fwupd and potentially perform malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker does not need to do anything other than have local access to the system. The vulnerability exists in how the file is saved, and it's always exploitable by any user that can read the file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access is required. Any user that can read the file, even one that has not exploited any other vulnerability, is able to view the sensitive information."
