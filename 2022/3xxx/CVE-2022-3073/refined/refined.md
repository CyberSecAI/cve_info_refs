- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a JavaScript injection flaw within the XML editing system SCHEMA ST4 online help, specifically in the '\*-schema.js' script used in example web templates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via URL to the affected products. This can lead to session hijacking, allowing for unauthorized actions on other web services within the same environment, execution of scripts in the user's browser environment, denial-of-service (DoS), unauthorized access to sensitive information, or gaining administrative access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code and trick a logged-in user into clicking it. The vulnerability is triggered by user interaction with the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince an authenticated user of the vulnerable application to click on it, requiring social engineering.
