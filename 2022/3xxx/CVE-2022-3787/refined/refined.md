{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A security regression of the fix for CVE-2022-41974 was introduced in device-mapper-multipath updates included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.7 and 9.1. The vulnerability occurs due to mishandling of repeated keywords in the multipath daemon when arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR. This leads to a local privilege escalation to root.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authorization bypass in multipath daemon through abstract Unix socket connections.",
      "Incorrect handling of repeated keywords causing privilege escalation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local users that are able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to a system running a vulnerable version of the device-mapper-multipath package. Attacker should have write access to unix domain sockets."
