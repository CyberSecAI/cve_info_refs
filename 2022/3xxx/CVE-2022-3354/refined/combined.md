| Hi all,  First of all, I'd like to analyze this issue deeply, because I got this in the very first test. However, it seems really easy to achieve a DoS attack by executing a simple port scan.  Following image shows the UPF log after the scan:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56645347/190979660-dfd0717f-382e-46d8-8f06-267fb26ccea6.png)  I'll update this thread with further discoveries.  Regards. |

| [@acetcom](https://github.com/acetcom)  My fault :)  It seems it's fixed now. It logs errors because of the malformed UDP payload (as expected) but it doesn't crash. Besides, I tried to register a new UE during the port scan and it attaches to the network successfully (highlighted on the following picture).  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56645347/192737024-73e427c1-f4dd-41ca-97c0-620f70157f6e.png)  Thanks again!  Regards. |

`[Update repo to open5gs/open5gs main (](/securitylab-repository/open5gs_ciot/commit/fdfe2c951870458716094018f75ebc5d298f3bd7 "Update repo to open5gs/open5gs main (#1)

* Initialize pgw_s5u_teid (#1559)

* [SMF] Gy: Send Multiple-Services-Indicator AVP only during Initial CCR (#1616)

Gy (3GPP TS 32.299 ) refers to AVP in DCCA (RFC4006).

RFC4006 5.1.2:
\"[...] by including the Multiple-Services-Indicator AVP in the first
interrogation.\"

Nokia's infocenter documentation also states it's sent during Initial CCR
only: \"(CCR-I only)\".

* [SBI] Fix memory leak for nghttp2 session (#1618)

Delete nghttp2 session to prevent memory leaks.
The issue was detected using valgrind.

* [CORE] fsm: Add asserts to validate ogs_fsm_t is not null (#1619)

* Change Default MCC/MNC 901/70 -> 999/70 (#1331)

* [SMF] track and fix scenario where gtp node mempool becomes full (#1622)

* [SMF] Avoid abort() if gtp_node mempool becomes full

Related: https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/1621

* [SMF] metrics: Add new ctr tracking gtp_node allocation failures

This metrics is useful to track whether at some point the mempool went
full, so that config needs to be updated to increase the mempool size.

* [SGWC,SMF] Add specific config opt max.gtp_peer to set gtp_node mempool size (#1623)

This is needed specially for SMFs handling a pool of SGWs.

* [UPF] Avoid crash if no default subnet configured (#1624)

In that case, ogs_pfcp_ue_ip_alloc() will fail with  the error message
\"CHECK CONFIGURATION: Cannot find subnet [...]\" and the assert will make
upf crash.
That's not desirable, let's keep it running and simply reject the
request. The error log is big enoguh to find out.

* [SMF] pfcp-sm: Fix ogs_fsm_dispatch() on NULL sess (#1628)

It was spotted that if DeleteSessionReq sent by SMF is answered by UPF
with cause=\"Session context not found\", then it contains SEID=0 (this is
correct as per specs). Hence, since SEID=0 session is not looked up, so
sess=NULL.

A follow up commit improves the situation by looking up the SEID in the
originating request message in that case.

* [SMF] Set v4/6 flag in F-TEID IE request type (#1625)

Signed-off-by: Networkmama <networkmama12@gmail.com>

* Set v4/v6 flags in local F-TEID (#1625)

* [PFCP] Added DNN/APN in FAR (#1629, #1630)

* [PFCP] Added Network Instance to CP-UP FAR (#1630)

* [SMF] Gn: QoS Profile and PCO IE improvements (#1631)

* [SMF] pfcp: Retrieve sess when response with SEID=0 is received (#1620)

3GPP TS 29.244 7.2.2.4.2 documents that the peer will set SEID=0 in the
response when we request something for a session not existing at the peer.
If that's the case, we still want to locate the local session which
originated the request, so let's store the local SEID in the xact when
submitting the message, so that we can retrieve the related SEID and
find the session if we receive SEID=0.

* [SGWC] pfcp: Retrieve sess when SEID=0 (#1620)

* [GTP] context when TEID=0 (#1620, #1606, #1594)

* [SCTP] Add protection code jumbo frame (#1632)

* [GTP] Avoid abort if ogs_gtp_node_new() returns NULL (#1633)

* [GTP] Avoid abort if ogs_gtp_node_new() returns NULL

* [SGWC] Avoid abort if ogs_gtp_node_add_by_addr() returns NULL

* [GTP] avoid abort for ogs_gtp_node_new() (#1633)

* [UPF] N4: Remove unnecessary assert (#1634)

* Changes MAX TLV MORE to 16

OGS_MAX_NUM_OF_PDR is 16, but OGS_TLV_MAX_MORE is 8.
To match the size of two macros, increased OGS_TLV_MAX_MORE to 16.

* Revert \"[GTP] context when TEID=0 (#1620, #1606, #1594)\"

This reverts commit 0d61f7a7f905a865bcd8be9382ffabeb817f8464.

* Revert \"[SGWC] pfcp: Retrieve sess when SEID=0 (#1620)\"

This reverts commit 970056302390471e7089a7a2ed08bcf979fd057d.

* [PFCP] Refine error code path without assertion

Refer to #1635, #1620

* [GTP] Refine error code path without assertion

Refer to #1635, #1620, #1606, #1594

* Fixed a crash when slice/session overflow (#1637)

* [MISC] Add support for static code analysis

Static code analysis can be executed with following commands:
  meson build
  ninja -C build analyze-cppcheck
  ninja -C build analyze-clang-tidy

These commands are available only if additional tools are installed:
  - cppcheck
  - clang-tidy
  - clang-tools is optional if you want to paralelize the clang-tidy

In case of cppcheck analysis, a file called build/cppchecklog.log is
created with the analysis results.

In case of clang-tidy analysis, some checks are disabled. See file
.clang-tidy, and reenable them if you see fit.
Also it does not scan all the files in the project, since some of them
are imported from other sources. It does not scan any sources under:
  - subprojects/
  - lib/asn1c/
  - lib/ipfw/

* [SBI] fixed wrong request-nf-type (#1650)

* [AMF] Do not send Deregistration Event to UDM when UE deregisters

According to TS 23.502, 4.2.2.2.2, AMF sends Registration event to UDM
in the following cases:
- If the AMF has changed since the last Registration procedure, or
- if the UE provides a SUPI which doesn't refer to a valid context in
the AMF,
- or if the UE registers to the same AMF it has already registered
to a non- 3GPP access (i.e. the UE is registered over a non-3GPP access
and initiates this Registration procedure to add a 3GPP access).

In case that UE re-registers to the network with a GUTI, it bypasses
authentication check to the AUSF. In this case, AMF does not send
Registration event to UDM.
Consequently, when UE deregisters again, AMF would send a Deregistration
Event to a UDM, which does not have a context for it.

3GPP standard does not say when AMF sends Deregistration Event to UDM,
only that it is optional.

These (De-)Registration events are for (de-)registering AMF to the UDM
for serving the UE. And not for (de-)registering UE itself for purpose
of tracking when UE is registered on the network.

This partially reverts commit 7be7029ac40b2eecbf70564d5306f85dafa2b848

* [NAS] modify library to include both directions of deregistration requests

Definitions in NAS library now include both directions of deregistration
requests/accepts - from UE and from network.

* [SBI] Add support for DeregistrationData in SBI messages

* [AMF] Handle namf-callback DeregNotify message from UDM

UDM may send a Deregistration Notification to AMF, to deregister
specific UE from the network - Network-Initiated Deregistration.
Deregistration procedure includes sending Deregistration Request to UE,
starting a timer T3522, releasing PDU sessions from SMF, releasing PCF
policies from PCF, and waiting for Deregistration Accept from UE.

Not yet implemented is:
- to prevent deregistration of UE in case it has any emergency sessions,
- page UE when UE is in IDLE mode.

* [AMF] Fixed 5GMM cause in Reject message (#1660)

When a UE that requests slices tries to connect and there are no slices configured, the reject message is:

5GMM cause = 0x7 (5GS Services not allowed)

however it should be:

5GMM cause = 0x3e (No network slices available)

All 5GMM cause value in reject message is reviewed in this commit

* [SBI] Add function to request NF Instance from NRF by providing it's Instance Id

* [SMF] Send PDU Session Establish Accept to serving AMF

In case there are multiple AMF registered to NRF, SMF would pick only
the first AMF from the list.
In the case of sending PDU Session Establishment Accept from SMF to
AMF, this would mean a high chance of failure since the AMF might
be different than the original requester, and would not know about a
particular UE.

Modify SMF to use ServingNfId field from original request
SmContextCreateData from AMF to determine to which AMF should it send
PDU Session Establishment Accept message.

* Set default Network-Access-Mode to 0

For HSS's which do not include the NAM, the MME should not treat this as a fatal error.  MME should just assume PACKET_AND_CIRCUIT (0), as was decided in a previous PR.

* [MME] Handle Charging Characteristics

Found no support for HSS provided charging characteristics.  Following TS32.251 A.4:
- Use PDN level CC, if one wasn't provided then use subscription level CC
- Don't send CC in S11 if it wasn't included

* Moving handling of assigning sub level cc into the pdn to s11.

* Support Discovery Optional Parameter (#1671)

Discovery optional parameter is implemeted

* Oops! Warning removed!

* Refine code of discovery option param (#1671)

* Release v2.4.9

* [MME] Introduce support for S6a Cancel Location Request

- Added diameter dictionary definitions for Cancel Location
- Cancel Location will completely remove UE from MME, allow for a fresh IMSI attach to occur on next attempt.
- T3422 is used for detach request.
- Added new handling for s6a events in mme-sm, as not all s6a messages are at attach now.  Maybe there's something in a state machine I should've been using here instead of a new flag?

- Testing was completed with UE in idle and connected.  With CLR flags indicating re-attach required and without.  Also sending CLR after UE detach.  And then sending again when mme_ue is empty.

* [SMF]: Update stored PCO IE requested in GTPv2 over S5c in SMF context

As per 3GPP TS 29.274 version 10.5.0, section 7.2.9 and 7.2.10,
Only if PCO IE is included in Delete Session Request then it
must be present in Delete Session Response.

In order to reflect on whether the request contained PCO IE or not
the SMF context containing the GTP request needs to be updated
i.e. update if present else clear the contents

* [SMF]: Update stored PCO IE requested over Gn in SMF context

As per 3GPP TS 29.060 version 15.3.0, section 7.3.3, 7.3.4, 7.3.5 and 7.3.6

Only if PCO IE is included in Update/Delete PDP Context Request then it
must be present in Update/Delete PDP Context Response.

In order to reflect on whether the request contained PCO IE or not

* [MME] Cancel Location Handling (#1698)

* CLR while idle is broken after https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/7031856cd779af0129ca444e18bbe2ed5db9ff32

Cancel Location Request arriving while UE is idle will not proceed to paging due to this check for S1 connection.  Using new flag \"isAnswer\" to bypass this check to allow paging to occur when we are not doing a AIA/ULA related procedure.

* No Context Setup is required when sending the detach request.  If the paging was due to wanting to send a Detach Request to the UE, then we fast track to sending the detach request.

* emm-sm.c:
In the case of MME initiated detach while UE is idle, there is no initial conext setup.  We go right from the service request after paging into sending the detach request.  TS23.401

mme-path.c:
Using nas_eps.type in the case of MME Initiated Detach while UE is idle does not work.  nas_eps.type would represent the service request.

mme-s11-handler.c:
After S11 action, no action should be taken.  We want to wait for the detach accept from the UE before proceeding with the S1 release (detach).

* InitialContextSetup should occur for detach.

* [MME] Follow-up Cancel Location Handling (#1698)

* [MME] Fixed GTP transaction crash (#1696)

* [SGsAP] Changed message if Paging failed (#1701)

The problem occurred in the following scenario:

1. VLR sent PAGING-REQUEST to the MME
2. MME sent S1-Paging to the UE
3. Paging failed
4. MME responded SERVICE-REQUEST to the VLR
5. VLR sent DOWNLINK-UNITDATA to the MME
6. Even though there is no S1 Context,
   MME try to sent DownlinkNASTransport message to the UE.
7. So, the problem occurred.

I've changed the number 4 PAGING-REJECT instead of SERVICE-REQUEST.

* [MME] Dictionary Updates and IDR Support (#1714)

* Add Diameter Dictionary Elements

* Initial IDR Framework

* Resolve Compile Issues

* Moving Closer

* Compile error

* Somewhat Working stuffing Code

* Add Timestamp Changes

* Cleanup some of this code.  mme_s6a_handle_idr in s6a-handler.c removed for now, since it will only come in handy when IDR flag is set to request current location, which would involve breaking out into paging.  I think there's a few other things we can do just within fd-path first.

* further removal of mme_s6a_handle_idr

* Follow up on #1714

* Changed sprintf to ogs_snprintf

* Limited to 80 column

* [NRF] Fixed library load error

* [metrics] Fix double-free on application exit (#1717)

* [SBI] Support service-names in discovery option

* diameter: Gx: add AVP 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics

The 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics is an operator specific AVP
(optional). The 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics can be filled by the HSS
and pass through to the Gx interface.

See ETSI 29.212 5.4.0.1 for further details.

* [SMF] send 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics on Gx if received on S5/8c

The 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics is an operator specific AVP
(optional). The 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics can be filled by the HSS
and forwarded by the MME towards the SMF.

* Follow up on #1715

* Changed <TAB> to <SPACE>*4

* Changed snprintf to ogs_snprintf

* [Conf] Changed MTU size from 1500 to 1400

* [SMF] fixup send 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics on Gx if received on S5/8c

- Gy instead of Gx AVP was used.
- Use correct avp position and avp variables.

* Added Service-based NF discovery

== Known limitation ==
Placing npcf-smpolicycontrol and pcf-policyauthorization
in different NFs is not supported. Both npcf-smpolicycontrol
and pcf-policyauthorization should be placed in the same NF.

* [ALL] Removing trailing whitespace and tab

* [MME] Fixed buffer overflow (#1728)

* Added simple test program

* [SMF] Handle upCnxState=ACTIVATING by replying with 200 instead of 204

According to TS 29.502 5.2.2.3.2.2., we should reply with a 200 response
including the upCnxState attribute.

* Follow-up on #1729

* [SBI] Send NF discovery query with service-names delimited with comma

OpenAPI specification for sending NF discovery query with
\"service-names\" parameter is defined as folowing:

- name: service-names
  ...
  style: form
  explode: false

According to OpenAPI specification, this means array items
should be delimited with a comma character (example: /users?id=3,4,5).

* [PCF] Check NF service configuration

* npcf-smpolicycontrol - enabled or disabled
* npcf-policyauthorization - enabled or disabled

Only one of npcf-smpolicycontrol and npcf-policyauthorization cannot be enabled. (../src/pcf/sbi-path.c:151)

They can be enabled or disabled together.

* [CORE] Check if timer is double free in SBI module

* removing extra lines

I did not find the purpose of their use

* [AMF] Accept Deregistration Notification from UDM only for registered UE (#1737)

Add additional check when receiving Deregistration Notification from
UDM. UE should already be in registered state before accepting the
request and deregistering the UE.

Also add additional check that PCF association policy exists before
sending a delete request to PCF.

* When using longer APN name, it is obscured due to short field.

* Also format for pcc_rule.  UE and SMF look okay as medium_data as first section.

* Minor typo fix

* Support service-based NF subscription

* [AMF] Handle APN/DNN names as case-insensitive

In case that APN name sent from UE does not case-match with the one
configured in the database, AMF would reject the registration with the
message:

[gmm] WARNING: [imsi-xxx] DNN Not Supported OR Not Subscribed in the
Slice (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:1051)

* Follow-up on #1747

* Release v2.4.10

* Added Release Notes for v2.4.10

* Introduce Cancel Location and Insert Subscriber Data features to HSS. (#1744)

* Introduce Cancel Location and Insert Subscriber Data features to HSS.
* HSS database will keep track of last known MME and Update Time
* Purged UE flag is established in HSS for future PUR handling
* HSS Thread will connect to database and watch change stream
  mongoDB must be configured with a Replica Set to use this
* HSS will send IDR if subscription data changes
* HSS will send CLR to old MME if MME host or realm changes
* Function created to allow ULA and IDR to generate Subscription-Data AVP
* MME Hostname and Realm shown in WebUI

* Resolve freeDiameter errors

During a ULR, if database does not contain a last known MME, a CLR is being sent to a Null destination.  This will ensure that a destination is available in the database before sending the CLR.

* Removed change streams.  Added PUR handling.

* newline needed at end of file.

* Removed temp variable.

* * Change WebUI to 2x2 display
* Including UE Purged indicator
* Using pointers in ogs_subscription_data_t
* better memory mangement with pointers
* Tweak to Destination used by hss_s6a_send_idr to use last known MME

* Check for null mme_host and mme_realms

Do this before trying to compare the strings.

* Follow-up on #1744

* [SMF] Wait for both N1&N2 release signals before releasing session

When UE would send a request to release PDU session, AMF would
eventually send \"PDU Session Resource Release Command\" downlink to both
UE (N1) and gNB (N2). Each UE and gNB would then reply with \"PDU Session
Resource Release Response\" indicating they released their own resources.

Usually the first one to respond would be gNB. SMF made an assumption
that this would always be the case. And it would wait for signal that UE
resources were freed, before releasing session resources. But
occasionally the situation is that UE responds first, and SMF releases
resources prematurely.

This situation does not normally occur. But under high stress (100's of
UE PDU releases at the same time) this happens occasionally.
According to the standard, this situation is perfectly normal.

3GPP TS 23.502 Rel. 16
4.3.4.2 UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Non-Roaming and
Roaming with Local Breakout

amount of maximum configured UE.

Without this change, AMF would crash in case that there are 'x'
configured maximum amount of UE, and there are already 'x' registered
UE.

Gy (3GPP TS 32.299 ) refers to AVP in DCCA (RFC4006).

\"[...] by including the Multiple-Services-Indicator AVP in the first
interrogation.\"

Nokia's infocenter documentation also states it's sent during Initial CCR
only: \"(CCR-I only)\".

* [SMF] Avoid abort() if gtp_node mempool becomes full

Related: https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/1621

* [SMF] metrics: Add new ctr tracking gtp_node allocation failures

This metrics is useful to track whether at some point the mempool went
full, so that config needs to be updated to increase the mempool size.

* [SGWC,SMF] Add specific config opt max.gtp_peer to set gtp_node mempool size (#1623)

This is needed specially for SMFs handling a pool of SGWs.

* [UPF] Avoid crash if no default subnet configured (#1624)

In that case, ogs_pfcp_ue_ip_alloc() will fail with  the error message
\"CHECK CONFIGURATION: Cannot find subnet [...]\" and the assert will make
upf crash.
That's not desirable, let's keep it running and simply reject the
request. The error log is big enoguh to find out.

* [SMF] pfcp-sm: Fix ogs_fsm_dispatch() on NULL sess (#1628)

It was spotted that if DeleteSessionReq sent by SMF is answered by UPF
with cause=\"Session context not found\", then it contains SEID=0 (this is
correct as per specs). Hence, since SEID=0 session is not looked up, so
sess=NULL.

A follow up commit improves the situation by looking up the SEID in the
originating request message in that case.

* [SMF] pfcp: Retrieve sess when response with SEID=0 is received (#1620)

3GPP TS 29.244 7.2.2.4.2 documents that the peer will set SEID=0 in the
response when we request something for a session not existing at the peer.
If that's the case, we still want to locate the local session which
originated the request, so let's store the local SEID in the xact when
submitting the message, so that we can retrieve the related SEID and
find the session if we receive SEID=0.

* [MISC] Add support for static code analysis

Static code analysis can be executed with following commands:
  meson build
  ninja -C build analyze-cppcheck
  ninja -C build analyze-clang-tidy

These commands are available only if additional tools are installed:
  - cppcheck
  - clang-tidy
  - clang-tools is optional if you want to paralelize the clang-tidy

In case of cppcheck analysis, a file called build/cppchecklog.log is
created with the analysis results.

In case of clang-tidy analysis, some checks are disabled. See file
.clang-tidy, and reenable them if you see fit.
Also it does not scan all the files in the project, since some of them
are imported from other sources. It does not scan any sources under:
  - subprojects/
  - lib/asn1c/
  - lib/ipfw/

* [SBI] fixed wrong request-nf-type (#1650)

* [AMF] Do not send Deregistration Event to UDM when UE deregisters

According to TS 23.502, 4.2.2.2.2, AMF sends Registration event to UDM
in the following cases:
- If the AMF has changed since the last Registration procedure, or
- if the UE provides a SUPI which doesn't refer to a valid context in
the AMF,
- or if the UE registers to the same AMF it has already registered
to a non- 3GPP access (i.e. the UE is registered over a non-3GPP access
and initiates this Registration procedure to add a 3GPP access).

In case that UE re-registers to the network with a GUTI, it bypasses
authentication check to the AUSF. In this case, AMF does not send
Registration event to UDM.
Consequently, when UE deregisters again, AMF would send a Deregistration
Event to a UDM, which does not have a context for it.

3GPP standard does not say when AMF sends Deregistration Event to UDM,
only that it is optional.

These (De-)Registration events are for (de-)registering AMF to the UDM
for serving the UE. And not for (de-)registering UE itself for purpose
of tracking when UE is registered on the network.

This partially reverts commit 7be7029ac40b2eecbf70564d5306f85dafa2b848

* [NAS] modify library to include both directions of deregistration requests

Definitions in NAS library now include both directions of deregistration
requests/accepts - from UE and from network.

* [SBI] Add support for DeregistrationData in SBI messages

* [AMF] Handle namf-callback DeregNotify message from UDM

UDM may send a Deregistration Notification to AMF, to deregister
specific UE from the network - Network-Initiated Deregistration.
Deregistration procedure includes sending Deregistration Request to UE,
starting a timer T3522, releasing PDU sessions from SMF, releasing PCF
policies from PCF, and waiting for Deregistration Accept from UE.

Not yet implemented is:
- to prevent deregistration of UE in case it has any emergency sessions,
- page UE when UE is in IDLE mode.

* [AMF] Fixed 5GMM cause in Reject message (#1660)

When a UE that requests slices tries to connect and there are no slices configured, the reject message is:

5GMM cause = 0x7 (5GS Services not allowed)

however it should be:

5GMM cause = 0x3e (No network slices available)

All 5GMM cause value in reject message is reviewed in this commit

* [SBI] Add function to request NF Instance from NRF by providing it's Instance Id

* [SMF] Send PDU Session Establish Accept to serving AMF

In case there are multiple AMF registered to NRF, SMF would pick only
the first AMF from the list.
In the case of sending PDU Session Establishment Accept from SMF to
AMF, this would mean a high chance of failure since the AMF might
be different than the original requester, and would not know about a
particular UE.

Modify SMF to use ServingNfId field from original request
SmContextCreateData from AMF to determine to which AMF should it send
PDU Session Establishment Accept message.

* Set default Network-Access-Mode to 0

For HSS's which do not include the NAM, the MME should not treat this as a fatal error.  MME should just assume PACKET_AND_CIRCUIT (0), as was decided in a previous PR.

* [MME] Handle Charging Characteristics

Found no support for HSS provided charging characteristics.  Following TS32.251 A.4:
- Use PDN level CC, if one wasn't provided then use subscription level CC
- Don't send CC in S11 if it wasn't included

* Moving handling of assigning sub level cc into the pdn to s11.

* Support Discovery Optional Parameter (#1671)

To support target-nf-instance-id in the discovery,
Discovery optional parameter is implemeted

* Oops! Warning removed!

* Refine code of discovery option param (#1671)

* Release v2.4.9

* [MME] Introduce support for S6a Cancel Location Request

- Added diameter dictionary definitions for Cancel Location
- Cancel Location will completely remove UE from MME, allow for a fresh IMSI attach to occur on next attempt.
- T3422 is used for detach request.
- Added new handling for s6a events in mme-sm, as not all s6a messages are at attach now.  Maybe there's something in a state machine I should've been using here instead of a new flag?

- Testing was completed with UE in idle and connected.  With CLR flags indicating re-attach required and without.  Also sending CLR after UE detach.  And then sending again when mme_ue is empty.

Only if PCO IE is included in Delete Session Request then it
must be present in Delete Session Response.

In order to reflect on whether the request contained PCO IE or not
the SMF context containing the GTP request needs to be updated
i.e. update if present else clear the contents

* [SMF]: Update stored PCO IE requested over Gn in SMF context

As per 3GPP TS 29.060 version 15.3.0, section 7.3.3, 7.3.4, 7.3.5 and 7.3.6

Only if PCO IE is included in Update/Delete PDP Context Request then it
must be present in Update/Delete PDP Context Response.

In order to reflect on whether the request contained PCO IE or not
the SMF context containing the GTP request needs to be updated
i.e. update if present else clear the contents

* CLR while idle is broken after https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/7031856cd779af0129ca444e18bbe2ed5db9ff32

Cancel Location Request arriving while UE is idle will not proceed to paging due to this check for S1 connection.  Using new flag \"isAnswer\" to bypass this check to allow paging to occur when we are not doing a AIA/ULA related procedure.

* No Context Setup is required when sending the detach request.  If the paging was due to wanting to send a Detach Request to the UE, then we fast track to sending the detach request.

* emm-sm.c:
In the case of MME initiated detach while UE is idle, there is no initial conext setup.  We go right from the service request after paging into sending the detach request.  TS23.401

mme-path.c:
Using nas_eps.type in the case of MME Initiated Detach while UE is idle does not work.  nas_eps.type would represent the service request.

mme-s11-handler.c:
After S11 action, no action should be taken.  We want to wait for the detach accept from the UE before proceeding with the S1 release (detach).

* InitialContextSetup should occur for detach.

* [MME] Follow-up Cancel Location Handling (#1698)

* [MME] Fixed GTP transaction crash (#1696)

* [SGsAP] Changed message if Paging failed (#1701)

The problem occurred in the following scenario:

1. VLR sent PAGING-REQUEST to the MME
2. MME sent S1-Paging to the UE
3. Paging failed
4. MME responded SERVICE-REQUEST to the VLR
5. VLR sent DOWNLINK-UNITDATA to the MME
6. Even though there is no S1 Context,
   MME try to sent DownlinkNASTransport message to the UE.
7. So, the problem occurred.

I've changed the number 4 PAGING-REJECT instead of SERVICE-REQUEST.

* Compile error

* Somewhat Working stuffing Code

* Add Timestamp Changes

* Cleanup some of this code.  mme_s6a_handle_idr in s6a-handler.c removed for now, since it will only come in handy when IDR flag is set to request current location, which would involve breaking out into paging.  I think there's a few other things we can do just within fd-path first.

* further removal of mme_s6a_handle_idr

* Follow up on #1714

* Changed sprintf to ogs_snprintf

* Limited to 80 column

* [NRF] Fixed library load error

* [metrics] Fix double-free on application exit (#1717)

* [SBI] Support service-names in discovery option

* [SBI] Added config for service-names discovery

* diameter: Gx: add AVP 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics

The 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics is an operator specific AVP
(optional). The 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics can be filled by the HSS
and pass through to the Gx interface.

See ETSI 29.212 5.4.0.1 for further details.

* [SMF] send 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics on Gx if received on S5/8c

The 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics is an operator specific AVP
(optional). The 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics can be filled by the HSS
and forwarded by the MME towards the SMF.

* Follow up on #1715

* Changed <TAB> to <SPACE>*4

* Changed snprintf to ogs_snprintf

* [Conf] Changed MTU size from 1500 to 1400

* [SMF] fixup send 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics on Gx if received on S5/8c

- Gy instead of Gx AVP was used.
- Use correct avp position and avp variables.

Fixes: 657eef9169af (\"[SMF] send 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics on Gx if received on S5/8c\")

* Added Service-based NF discovery

== Known limitation ==
Placing npcf-smpolicycontrol and pcf-policyauthorization
in different NFs is not supported. Both npcf-smpolicycontrol
and pcf-policyauthorization should be placed in the same NF.

* [ALL] Removing trailing whitespace and tab

* [MME] Fixed buffer overflow (#1728)

* Added simple test program

./tests/registration/registration simple-test
./tests/vonr/vonr simple-test
./tests/attach/attach simple-test
./tests/volte/volte simple-test

* [SMF] Handle upCnxState=ACTIVATING by replying with 200 instead of 204

According to TS 29.502 5.2.2.3.2.2., we should reply with a 200 response
including the upCnxState attribute.

* Follow-up on #1729

* [SBI] Send NF discovery query with service-names delimited with comma

OpenAPI specification for sending NF discovery query with
\"service-names\" parameter is defined as folowing:

- name: service-names
  ...
  style: form
  explode: false

According to OpenAPI specification, this means array items
should be delimited with a comma character (example: /users?id=3,4,5).

* [PCF] Check NF service configuration

* npcf-smpolicycontrol - enabled or disabled
* npcf-policyauthorization - enabled or disabled

Only one of npcf-smpolicycontrol and npcf-policyauthorization cannot be enabled. (../src/pcf/sbi-path.c:151)

They can be enabled or disabled together.

* [CORE] Check if timer is double free in SBI module

* removing extra lines

I did not find the purpose of their use

* [AMF] Accept Deregistration Notification from UDM only for registered UE (#1737)

Add additional check when receiving Deregistration Notification from
UDM. UE should already be in registered state before accepting the
request and deregistering the UE.

Also add additional check that PCF association policy exists before
sending a delete request to PCF.

* When using longer APN name, it is obscured due to short field.

* Also format for pcc_rule.  UE and SMF look okay as medium_data as first section.

* Minor typo fix

* Support service-based NF subscription

* [AMF] Handle APN/DNN names as case-insensitive

In case that APN name sent from UE does not case-match with the one
configured in the database, AMF would reject the registration with the
message:

[gmm] WARNING: [imsi-xxx] DNN Not Supported OR Not Subscribed in the
Slice (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:1051)

* Follow-up on #1747

* Release v2.4.10

* Added Release Notes for v2.4.10

* Introduce Cancel Location and Insert Subscriber Data features to HSS. (#1744)

* Introduce Cancel Location and Insert Subscriber Data features to HSS.
* HSS database will keep track of last known MME and Update Time
* Purged UE flag is established in HSS for future PUR handling
* HSS Thread will connect to database and watch change stream
  mongoDB must be configured with a Replica Set to use this
* HSS will send IDR if subscription data changes
* HSS will send CLR to old MME if MME host or realm changes
* Function created to allow ULA and IDR to generate Subscription-Data AVP
* MME Hostname and Realm shown in WebUI

* Resolve freeDiameter errors

During a ULR, if database does not contain a last known MME, a CLR is being sent to a Null destination.  This will ensure that a destination is available in the database before sending the CLR.

* Removed change streams.  Added PUR handling.

* newline needed at end of file.

* Removed temp variable.

* * Change WebUI to 2x2 display
* Including UE Purged indicator
* Using pointers in ogs_subscription_data_t
* better memory mangement with pointers
* Tweak to Destination used by hss_s6a_send_idr to use last known MME

* Check for null mme_host and mme_realms

Do this before trying to compare the strings.

* Follow-up on #1744

* [SMF] Wait for both N1&N2 release signals before releasing session

When UE would send a request to release PDU session, AMF would
eventually send \"PDU Session Resource Release Command\" downlink to both
UE (N1) and gNB (N2). Each UE and gNB would then reply with \"PDU Session
Resource Release Response\" indicating they released their own resources.

Usually the first one to respond would be gNB. SMF made an assumption
that this would always be the case. And it would wait for signal that UE
resources were freed, before releasing session resources. But
occasionally the situation is that UE responds first, and SMF releases
resources prematurely.

This situation does not normally occur. But under high stress (100's of
UE PDU releases at the same time) this happens occasionally.
According to the standard, this situation is perfectly normal.

3GPP TS 23.502 Rel. 16
4.3.4.2 UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Non-Roaming and
Roaming with Local Breakout
...
Steps 8-10 may happen before steps 6-7.
...

* Added commercial 5G

* Add tested Ericsson gNodeBs and eNodeBs

* [DOC] Fixed alphabet order

* Sponsors logo updated to be dark-mode friendly

* Updated favicon.ico in Document

* [GTP/PFCP] TLV length more acceptable (#1780)

Acceptable even if the TLV length is smaller than expected

* [AMF] Add amfInfoList to NFProfile

The actual configured GUAMIs and TAIs are used to form NF profile.
Comparing to SMF the \"info\" section is not introduced into amf.yaml!
Each amf_id (region, set) produces a separate Info in the InfoList.
Guami list consists of all GUAMIs of particular Info.
taiList consists of all TAIs for all PLMNs of particular Info.

If no response is received from the HTTP2 Server,
HTTP2 Client performs the exception handling.

In this commit, HTTP2 client sends Header with setting Max-Rsp-Time to 10 seconds.
However, HTTP2 server has not yet been implemented to process this value.
The server is still processing using hard-corded values (10 seconds).

* Updated SBI module

- Introduced NF_INSTANCE_ID/NF_INSTANCE_TYPE

* [AMF] Increase size of TMSI pool

Each UE context has 'current' and 'next' TMSI values. AMF first
allocates the 'next' value, before confirming it and releasing the
'previous'. This means that we potentially need pool size of 2x the
amount of maximum configured UE.

Without this change, AMF would crash in case that there are 'x'
configured maximum amount of UE, and there are already 'x' registered
UE.

```
* Initialize pgw_s5u_teid ([open5gs#1559](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/1559))

* [SMF] Gy: Send Multiple-Services-Indicator AVP only during Initial CCR ([open5gs#1616](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1616))

Gy (3GPP TS 32.299 ) refers to AVP in DCCA (RFC4006).

RFC4006 5.1.2:
"[...] by including the Multiple-Services-Indicator AVP in the first
interrogation."

Nokia's infocenter documentation also states it's sent during Initial CCR
only: "(CCR-I only)".

* [SBI] Fix memory leak for nghttp2 session ([open5gs#1618](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1618))

Delete nghttp2 session to prevent memory leaks.
The issue was detected using valgrind.

* [CORE] fsm: Add asserts to validate ogs_fsm_t is not null ([open5gs#1619](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1619))

* Change Default MCC/MNC 901/70 -> 999/70 ([open5gs#1331](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1331))

* [SMF] track and fix scenario where gtp node mempool becomes full ([open5gs#1622](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1622))

* [SMF] Avoid abort() if gtp_node mempool becomes full

Related: [open5gs#1621](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/1621)

* [SMF] metrics: Add new ctr tracking gtp_node allocation failures

This metrics is useful to track whether at some point the mempool went
full, so that config needs to be updated to increase the mempool size.

* [SGWC,SMF] Add specific config opt max.gtp_peer to set gtp_node mempool size ([open5gs#1623](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1623))

This is needed specially for SMFs handling a pool of SGWs.

* [UPF] Avoid crash if no default subnet configured ([open5gs#1624](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1624))

In that case, ogs_pfcp_ue_ip_alloc() will fail with  the error message
"CHECK CONFIGURATION: Cannot find subnet [...]" and the assert will make
upf crash.
That's not desirable, let's keep it running and simply reject the
request. The error log is big enoguh to find out.

* [SMF] pfcp-sm: Fix ogs_fsm_dispatch() on NULL sess ([open5gs#1628](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1628))

It was spotted that if DeleteSessionReq sent by SMF is answered by UPF
with cause="Session context not found", then it contains SEID=0 (this is
correct as per specs). Hence, since SEID=0 session is not looked up, so
sess=NULL.

A follow up commit improves the situation by looking up the SEID in the
originating request message in that case.

3GPP TS 29.244 7.2.2.4.2 documents that the peer will set SEID=0 in the
response when we request something for a session not existing at the peer.
If that's the case, we still want to locate the local session which
originated the request, so let's store the local SEID in the xact when
submitting the message, so that we can retrieve the related SEID and
find the session if we receive SEID=0.

* Fixed a crash when slice/session overflow ([open5gs#1637](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/1637))

* [MISC] Add support for static code analysis

Static code analysis can be executed with following commands:
  meson build
  ninja -C build analyze-cppcheck
  ninja -C build analyze-clang-tidy

These commands are available only if additional tools are installed:
  - cppcheck
  - clang-tidy
  - clang-tools is optional if you want to paralelize the clang-tidy

In case of cppcheck analysis, a file called build/cppchecklog.log is
created with the analysis results.

In case of clang-tidy analysis, some checks are disabled. See file
.clang-tidy, and reenable them if you see fit.
Also it does not scan all the files in the project, since some of them
are imported from other sources. It does not scan any sources under:
  - subprojects/
  - lib/asn1c/
  - lib/ipfw/

* [SBI] fixed wrong request-nf-type ([open5gs#1650](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/1650))

* [AMF] Do not send Deregistration Event to UDM when UE deregisters

According to TS 23.502, 4.2.2.2.2, AMF sends Registration event to UDM
in the following cases:
- If the AMF has changed since the last Registration procedure, or
- if the UE provides a SUPI which doesn't refer to a valid context in
the AMF,
- or if the UE registers to the same AMF it has already registered
to a non- 3GPP access (i.e. the UE is registered over a non-3GPP access
and initiates this Registration procedure to add a 3GPP access).

In case that UE re-registers to the network with a GUTI, it bypasses
authentication check to the AUSF. In this case, AMF does not send
Registration event to UDM.
Consequently, when UE deregisters again, AMF would send a Deregistration
Event to a UDM, which does not have a context for it.

3GPP standard does not say when AMF sends Deregistration Event to UDM,
only that it is optional.

These (De-)Registration events are for (de-)registering AMF to the UDM
for serving the UE. And not for (de-)registering UE itself for purpose
of tracking when UE is registered on the network.

This partially reverts commit [7be7029](https://github.com/securitylab-repository/open5gs_ciot/commit/7be7029ac40b2eecbf70564d5306f85dafa2b848)

* [NAS] modify library to include both directions of deregistration requests

Definitions in NAS library now include both directions of deregistration
requests/accepts - from UE and from network.

* [SBI] Add support for DeregistrationData in SBI messages

* [AMF] Handle namf-callback DeregNotify message from UDM

UDM may send a Deregistration Notification to AMF, to deregister
specific UE from the network - Network-Initiated Deregistration.
Deregistration procedure includes sending Deregistration Request to UE,
starting a timer T3522, releasing PDU sessions from SMF, releasing PCF
policies from PCF, and waiting for Deregistration Accept from UE.

Not yet implemented is:
- to prevent deregistration of UE in case it has any emergency sessions,
- page UE when UE is in IDLE mode.

however it should be:

5GMM cause = 0x3e (No network slices available)

* [SBI] Add function to request NF Instance from NRF by providing it's Instance Id

* [SMF] Send PDU Session Establish Accept to serving AMF

In case there are multiple AMF registered to NRF, SMF would pick only
the first AMF from the list.
In the case of sending PDU Session Establishment Accept from SMF to
AMF, this would mean a high chance of failure since the AMF might
be different than the original requester, and would not know about a
particular UE.

Modify SMF to use ServingNfId field from original request
SmContextCreateData from AMF to determine to which AMF should it send
PDU Session Establishment Accept message.

* Set default Network-Access-Mode to 0

For HSS's which do not include the NAM, the MME should not treat this as a fatal error.  MME should just assume PACKET_AND_CIRCUIT (0), as was decided in a previous PR.

* [MME] Introduce support for S6a Cancel Location Request

- Added diameter dictionary definitions for Cancel Location
- Cancel Location will completely remove UE from MME, allow for a fresh IMSI attach to occur on next attempt.
- T3422 is used for detach request.
- Added new handling for s6a events in mme-sm, as not all s6a messages are at attach now.  Maybe there's something in a state machine I should've been using here instead of a new flag?

- Testing was completed with UE in idle and connected.  With CLR flags indicating re-attach required and without.  Also sending CLR after UE detach.  And then sending again when mme_ue is empty.

Cancel Location Request arriving while UE is idle will not proceed to paging due to this check for S1 connection.  Using new flag "isAnswer" to bypass this check to allow paging to occur when we are not doing a AIA/ULA related procedure.

* No Context Setup is required when sending the detach request.  If the paging was due to wanting to send a Detach Request to the UE, then we fast track to sending the detach request.

* emm-sm.c:
In the case of MME initiated detach while UE is idle, there is no initial conext setup.  We go right from the service request after paging into sending the detach request.  TS23.401

mme-path.c:
Using nas_eps.type in the case of MME Initiated Detach while UE is idle does not work.  nas_eps.type would represent the service request.

mme-s11-handler.c:
After S11 action, no action should be taken.  We want to wait for the detach accept from the UE before proceeding with the S1 release (detach).

The problem occurred in the following scenario:

1. VLR sent PAGING-REQUEST to the MME
2. MME sent S1-Paging to the UE
3. Paging failed
4. MME responded SERVICE-REQUEST to the VLR
5. VLR sent DOWNLINK-UNITDATA to the MME
6. Even though there is no S1 Context,
   MME try to sent DownlinkNASTransport message to the UE.
7. So, the problem occurred.

I've changed the number 4 PAGING-REJECT instead of SERVICE-REQUEST.

* HSS Thread will connect to database and watch change stream
  mongoDB must be configured with a Replica Set to use this
* HSS will send IDR if subscription data changes
* HSS will send CLR to old MME if MME host or realm changes
* Function created to allow ULA and IDR to generate Subscription-Data AVP
* MME Hostname and Realm shown in WebUI

* Resolve freeDiameter errors

During a ULR, if database does not contain a last known MME, a CLR is being sent to a Null destination.  This will ensure that a destination is available in the database before sending the CLR.

* Removed change streams.  Added PUR handling.

* newline needed at end of file.

* Removed temp variable.

* * Change WebUI to 2x2 display
* Including UE Purged indicator
* Using pointers in ogs_subscription_data_t
* better memory mangement with pointers
* Tweak to Destination used by hss_s6a_send_idr to use last known MME

* Check for null mme_host and mme_realms

Do this before trying to compare the strings.

* [SMF] Wait for both N1&N2 release signals before releasing session

When UE would send a request to release PDU session, AMF would
eventually send "PDU Session Resource Release Command" downlink to both
UE (N1) and gNB (N2). Each UE and gNB would then reply with "PDU Session
Resource Release Response" indicating they released their own resources.

Usually the first one to respond would be gNB. SMF made an assumption
that this would always be the case. And it would wait for signal that UE
resources were freed, before releasing session resources. But
occasionally the situation is that UE responds first, and SMF releases
resources prematurely.

This situation does not normally occur. But under high stress (100's of
UE PDU releases at the same time) this happens occasionally.
According to the standard, this situation is perfectly normal.

3GPP TS 23.502 Rel. 16
4.3.4.2 UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Non-Roaming and
Roaming with Local Breakout
...
Steps 8-10 may happen before steps 6-7.

* Added commercial 5G

* Add tested Ericsson gNodeBs and eNodeBs

* [DOC] Fixed alphabet order

* Sponsors logo updated to be dark-mode friendly

* Updated favicon.ico in Document

* [GTP/PFCP] TLV length more acceptable ([open5gs#1780](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/discussions/1780))

Acceptable even if the TLV length is smaller than expected

* [AMF] Add amfInfoList to NFProfile

The actual configured GUAMIs and TAIs are used to form NF profile.
Comparing to SMF the "info" section is not introduced into amf.yaml!
Each amf_id (region, set) produces a separate Info in the InfoList.
Guami list consists of all GUAMIs of particular Info.
taiList consists of all TAIs for all PLMNs of particular Info.

Examle:

TS29.500
Ch 6.11 Detection and handling of late arriving requests

In Open5GS, this part was hard-corded.

HTTP2 Client sends a request and waits for 10 seconds.
If no response is received from the HTTP2 Server,
HTTP2 Client performs the exception handling.

In this commit, HTTP2 client sends Header with setting Max-Rsp-Time to 10 seconds.
However, HTTP2 server has not yet been implemented to process this value.
The server is still processing using hard-corded values (10 seconds).

AMF subscribes to UDM for each registered UE.

At the moment, UDM does not send callback to AMF when any of the UE's
properties in the database changes.
At the moment, AMF does properly parse the ModificationNotification, but
does not do anything useful.

* Updated SBI module

- Introduced NF_INSTANCE_ID/NF_INSTANCE_TYPE
- Skip SCP in configuration validation

* [AMF] Increase size of TMSI pool

Each UE context has 'current' and 'next' TMSI values. AMF first
allocates the 'next' value, before confirming it and releasing the
'previous'. This means that we potentially need pool size of 2x the
amount of maximum configured UE.

Without this change, AMF would crash in case that there are 'x'
configured maximum amount of UE, and there are already 'x' registered
UE.

* [SBI] Client Request timeout

TS29.500
Ch 6.11 Detection and handling of late arriving requests

In Open5GS, this part was hard-corded.

HTTP2 Client sends a request and waits for 10 seconds.
If no response is received from the HTTP2 Server,
HTTP2 Client performs the exception handling.

In this commit, HTTP2 client sends Header with setting Max-Rsp-Time to 10 seconds.
However, HTTP2 server has not yet been implemented to process this value.
The server is still processing using hard-corded values (10 seconds).

* [AMF,UDM] Add support to subscribe to SDM changes

AMF subscribes to UDM for each registered UE.

At the moment, UDM does not send callback to AMF when any of the UE's
properties in the database changes.
At the moment, AMF does properly parse the ModificationNotification, but
does not do anything useful.

* [SMF] Update PFCP report error situation (#1819)

* Revert the previous commit on #1797

* Updated SBI module

- Introduced NF_INSTANCE_ID/NF_INSTANCE_TYPE
- Skip SCP in configuration validation

* [AMF] Increase size of TMSI pool

Each UE context has 'current' and 'next' TMSI values. AMF first
allocates the 'next' value, before confirming it and releasing the
'previous'. This means that we potentially need pool size of 2x the
amount of maximum configured UE.

Without this change, AMF would crash in case that there are 'x'
configured maximum amount of UE, and there are already 'x' registered
UE.

Also move variable declarations to inner blocks, to prevent some
accidental usage out of wanted scope.

* [UPF] Add metrics support

Expose metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
UPF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

5qi is not available in UPF.
To present 5qi to the user, MN will have to maintain a table qfi->5qi
for each QoS flow (will have to get information from SMF).
So UPF has to expose qfi. qfi itself is not useful. When used, UPF will
have to expose additional label to define the session (e.g. source
interface).

Label dnn is set to value of APN/DNN received in Establishment.
Since SMF does not add APN/DNN to Establishment, the label is empty.
When APN/DNN will be set by SMF, it should be added to sess in UPF
and used in metrics on Modification and Deletion.

Both datavolumeqosleveln3upf are exposed in bytes.
MN is providing the transformation to kbits.

fivegs_upffunction_upf_qosflows should expose the number of QFIs used in
sessions, but exposes number of QER rules, which is currently equal to
QFIs.
The label snsssai is not provided since the slice is not available on UPF.

Exposed metrics example:
Standard counters:
fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_indatapktn3upf 28637
fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_outdatapktn3upf 14729
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabreq 4

fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"72\"} 15
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"75\"} 3

fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_outdatavolumeqosleveln3upf{qfi=\"1\"} 737548
Nonstandard gauge (added for controlling purposes -
same metric as existing metric on AMF and SMF):
fivegs_upffunction_upf_sessionnbr 1
Standard gauge:
fivegs_upffunction_upf_qosflows{dnn=\"\"} 1

* [PCF] Add metrics support

Expose metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
PCF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

AM policy:
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq and
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassosucc do not expose snssai label
since it is not available at the time of exposure.
plmnid is defined during AM policy processing, so not to lose the
difference to ...succ, the basic metric
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq is preserved.

SM policy:
snssai is defined during SM policy processing, so not to lose the
difference to ...succ, the basic metric
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq is preserved.

Those 2 basic metrics retain their position but are exposed with empty
labels.
Metrics with labels are called later, when the label values are known.

Exposed metrics example:
-standard counters:
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq{plmnid=\"\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq{plmnid=\"99970\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassosucc{plmnid=\"99970\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq{plmnid=\"\",snssai=\"\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq{plmnid=\"99970\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassosucc{plmnid=\"99970\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 3

-nonstandard gauge (added for controlling purposes -
same metric as existing metric on AMF and SMF):
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_sessionnbr{plmnid=\"99970\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 0

* Follow-up on #1940

* [SMF] fix crash due free-ing invalid pointer

In case that database is (manually) corrupted for a specific UE, SSC
mode and ARP preemption vulnerability fields are not set correctly,
SMF will crash when trying to build a request to create PCF association.

Function smf_npcf_smpolicycontrol_build_create() will end prematurely,
and when cleaning up resources it will try to free() up invalid pointer,
which was not set to 0 at beginning of the function.

* [AMF] Add RM metrics support

Expose RM metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
AMF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

RegInitFail is exposed as an alternative to RegInitReq and RegInitSucc
counters so cause label can be provided. It counts rejected registrations
and rejected authentications.
Rejected authentications are counted under label cause=\"0\".

Exposed metrics example:
-standard gauge:
fivegs_amffunction_rm_registeredsubnbr{plmnid=\"00101\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 1

-nonstandard counter:
fivegs_amffunction_rm_reginitfail{cause=\"3\"} 4

* [SMF] Add SM metrics support

Expose SM metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
SMF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>
Existing gauge sessions_active is renamed!

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

Exposed metrics example:
-standard gauges:
fivegs_smffunction_sm_sessionnbr{plmnid=\"00101\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 0
fivegs_smffunction_sm_qos_flow_nbr{plmnid=\"00101\",snssai=\"1000009\",fiveqi=\"9\"} 0

* Add NF load to NRF Heartbeat

The current load percentage of the NF Service Consumer is provided
in the payload body of the PATCH request when periodically
contacting the NRF (heart-beat).

AMF: ratio between currently connected ran_ue and maximum number of them
SMF: ratio between current PDU sessions and maximum available
PCF: ratio between current AM+SM policy associations and maximum available
     or ratio between currently connected UEs and maximum number of them
     (the load which is higher)
AUSF, UDM: ratio between currently connected UE and maximum number of them
BSF: ratio between current sessions and maximum available
NSSF: ratio between currently used NSIs and maximum number of them

NRF currently doesn't determine that the NF Profile has changed.

* [SMF] Fix metric bearers_active

Metric 'bearers_active' was incremented in only one code path
(smf_bearer_add() for 4G only), while it was decremented from two paths
(smf_bearer_remove() for both 4G and 5G).
Increment metric also for 5G path (smf_qos_flow_add()), so it won't get
decremented into negative values.

* [mongo] Use \"ping\" command instead of \"serverStatus\"

\"serverStatus\" on the \"admin\" database may fail due to insufficient privileges.

    MOBILE_REACHABLE is set when NAS connection for the UE is released.
    IMPLICIT_DEREGISTRATION is set when MOBILE_REACHABLE expires.

    On MOBILE_REACHABLE expiry Paging is ignored.
    On IMPLICIT_DEREGISTRATION expiry:
    -UE's RM_State is set to DEREGISTERED
    -UE is Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribed
    -UE is Nudm_UECM_Deregistered
    -PDU sessions are released
    -AM policies are deleted

    Existing flag amf_ue->network_initiated_de_reg is used.

Other NF instances are obtained through NRF
or created directly through configuration files.

Other NFs created by the config file should not be passed

'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x97 in position 3948: invalid start byte
Python3 requires input character data to be perfectly encoded;
it also requires perfectly correct system encoding settings.
Unfortunately, your data and/or system settings are not.

* [AMF] Network-Initiated Deregister (#2014, #2021)

Fixed a bug network-initiated implicit/explict deregistration

* [Gx/Gy] MAX_CC_REQUESTER_NUMBER(32->64) (#2038)

Incrased MAX_CC_REQUESTER_NUMBER from 32 to 64

* [NF] Fix double-free crash when NF is under heavy load

<nf>/init.c:<nf>_main() :
ogs_pollset_poll() receives the time of the expiration of next timer as
an argument. If this timeout is in very near future (1 millisecond),
and if there are multiple events that need to be processed by
ogs_pollset_poll(), these could take more than 1 millisecond for
processing, resulting in the timer already passed the expiration.

In case that another NF is under heavy load and responds to an SBI
request with some delay of a few seconds, it can happen that
ogs_pollset_poll() adds SBI responses to the event list for further
processing, then ogs_timer_mgr_expire() is called which will add an
additional event for timer expiration. When all events are processed
one-by-one, the SBI xact would get deleted twice in a row, resulting in
a crash.

* Fix UL and DL URR Usage Report

* Follow-on up #1793

* [AMF] Fix for switching state when sending Deregistration Request fails

Provide pointer to state machine, instead of pointer to timer structure.
Bug was noticed when switching compiler optimization to -O2.

* [SBI] Client Request timeout

TS29.500
Ch 6.11 Detection and handling of late arriving requests

In Open5GS, this part was hard-corded.

HTTP2 Client sends a request and waits for 10 seconds.
If no response is received from the HTTP2 Server,
HTTP2 Client performs the exception handling.

In this commit, HTTP2 client sends Header with setting Max-Rsp-Time to 10 seconds.
However, HTTP2 server has not yet been implemented to process this value.
The server is still processing using hard-corded values (10 seconds).

* [AMF,UDM] Add support to subscribe to SDM changes

AMF subscribes to UDM for each registered UE.

At the moment, UDM does not send callback to AMF when any of the UE's
properties in the database changes.
At the moment, AMF does properly parse the ModificationNotification, but
does not do anything useful.

* [SMF] Update PFCP report error situation (#1819)

* Revert the previous commit on #1797

* Updated SBI module

- Introduced NF_INSTANCE_ID/NF_INSTANCE_TYPE
- Skip SCP in configuration validation

* [AMF] Increase size of TMSI pool

Each UE context has 'current' and 'next' TMSI values. AMF first
allocates the 'next' value, before confirming it and releasing the
'previous'. This means that we potentially need pool size of 2x the
amount of maximum configured UE.

Without this change, AMF would crash in case that there are 'x'
configured maximum amount of UE, and there are already 'x' registered
UE.

OpenAPI dictates that certain arrays should have at least one item,
otherwise they should not be present.
This includes lists for IPv4/v6 addresses, TAI/TAC lists, ...

Add a check if there is at least 1 item, before creating an array.
Also move variable declarations to inner blocks, to prevent some
accidental usage out of wanted scope.

* [UPF] Add metrics support

Expose metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
UPF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

5qi is not available in UPF.
To present 5qi to the user, MN will have to maintain a table qfi->5qi
for each QoS flow (will have to get information from SMF).
So UPF has to expose qfi. qfi itself is not useful. When used, UPF will
have to expose additional label to define the session (e.g. source
interface).

Label dnn is set to value of APN/DNN received in Establishment.
Since SMF does not add APN/DNN to Establishment, the label is empty.
When APN/DNN will be set by SMF, it should be added to sess in UPF
and used in metrics on Modification and Deletion.

Both datavolumeqosleveln3upf are exposed in bytes.
MN is providing the transformation to kbits.

fivegs_upffunction_upf_qosflows should expose the number of QFIs used in
sessions, but exposes number of QER rules, which is currently equal to
QFIs.
The label snsssai is not provided since the slice is not available on UPF.

Exposed metrics example:
Standard counters:
fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_indatapktn3upf 28637
fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_outdatapktn3upf 14729
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabreq 4
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"66\"} 1
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"71\"} 68
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"68\"} 4
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"72\"} 15
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"75\"} 3
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"65\"} 4
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionreport 0
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionreportsucc 0
fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_indatavolumeqosleveln3upf{qfi=\"1\"} 39792997
fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_outdatavolumeqosleveln3upf{qfi=\"1\"} 737548
Nonstandard gauge (added for controlling purposes -
same metric as existing metric on AMF and SMF):
fivegs_upffunction_upf_sessionnbr 1
Standard gauge:
fivegs_upffunction_upf_qosflows{dnn=\"\"} 1

* [PCF] Add metrics support

Expose metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
PCF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

AM policy:
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq and
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassosucc do not expose snssai label
since it is not available at the time of exposure.
plmnid is defined during AM policy processing, so not to lose the
difference to ...succ, the basic metric
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq is preserved.

SM policy:
snssai is defined during SM policy processing, so not to lose the
difference to ...succ, the basic metric
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq is preserved.

Those 2 basic metrics retain their position but are exposed with empty
labels.
Metrics with labels are called later, when the label values are known.

Exposed metrics example:
-standard counters:
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq{plmnid=\"\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq{plmnid=\"99970\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassosucc{plmnid=\"99970\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq{plmnid=\"\",snssai=\"\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq{plmnid=\"99970\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassosucc{plmnid=\"99970\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 3

-nonstandard gauge (added for controlling purposes -
same metric as existing metric on AMF and SMF):
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_sessionnbr{plmnid=\"99970\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 0

* Follow-up on #1940

* Follow-up on #1940 - Fixed compile error

* [SMF] fix crash due free-ing invalid pointer

In case that database is (manually) corrupted for a specific UE, SSC
mode and ARP preemption vulnerability fields are not set correctly,
SMF will crash when trying to build a request to create PCF association.

Function smf_npcf_smpolicycontrol_build_create() will end prematurely,
and when cleaning up resources it will try to free() up invalid pointer,
which was not set to 0 at beginning of the function.

* [AMF] Add RM metrics support

Expose RM metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
AMF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

RegInitFail is exposed as an alternative to RegInitReq and RegInitSucc
counters so cause label can be provided. It counts rejected registrations
and rejected authentications.
Rejected authentications are counted under label cause=\"0\".

Exposed metrics example:
-standard gauge:
fivegs_amffunction_rm_registeredsubnbr{plmnid=\"00101\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 1

-nonstandard counter:
fivegs_amffunction_rm_reginitfail{cause=\"3\"} 4

* [SMF] Add SM metrics support

Expose SM metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
SMF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>
Existing gauge sessions_active is renamed!

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

Exposed metrics example:
-standard gauges:
fivegs_smffunction_sm_sessionnbr{plmnid=\"00101\",snssai=\"1000009\"} 0
fivegs_smffunction_sm_qos_flow_nbr{plmnid=\"00101\",snssai=\"1000009\",fiveqi=\"9\"} 0

-nonstandard counters:
fivegs_smffunction_sm_n4sessionestabfail{cause=\"71\"} 68
fivegs_smffunction_sm_n4sessionreport 1
fivegs_smffunction_sm_n4sessionreportsucc 1

* [AMF] Fix deletion of auth data from AUSF

* free socket fd

* Update document

* Update document

* Add NF load to NRF Heartbeat

The current load percentage of the NF Service Consumer is provided
in the payload body of the PATCH request when periodically
contacting the NRF (heart-beat).

AMF: ratio between currently connected ran_ue and maximum number of them
SMF: ratio between current PDU sessions and maximum available
PCF: ratio between current AM+SM policy associations and maximum available
     or ratio between currently connected UEs and maximum number of them
     (the load which is higher)
AUSF, UDM: ratio between currently connected UE and maximum number of them
BSF: ratio between current sessions and maximum available
NSSF: ratio between currently used NSIs and maximum number of them

NRF currently doesn't determine that the NF Profile has changed.

* [SMF] Fix metric bearers_active

Metric 'bearers_active' was incremented in only one code path
(smf_bearer_add() for 4G only), while it was decremented from two paths
(smf_bearer_remove() for both 4G and 5G).
Increment metric also for 5G path (smf_qos_flow_add()), so it won't get
decremented into negative values.

* [mongo] Use \"ping\" command instead of \"serverStatus\"

\"serverStatus\" on the \"admin\" database may fail due to insufficient privileges.

* Introduced Subscription identifier de-concealing

Incrased MAX_CC_REQUESTER_NUMBER from 32 to 64

* [NF] Fix double-free crash when NF is under heavy load

<nf>/init.c:<nf>_main() :
ogs_pollset_poll() receives the time of the expiration of next timer as
an argument. If this timeout is in very near future (1 millisecond),
and if there are multiple events that need to be processed by
ogs_pollset_poll(), these could take more than 1 millisecond for
processing, resulting in the timer already passed the expiration.

In case that another NF is under heavy load and responds to an SBI
request with some delay of a few seconds, it can happen that
ogs_pollset_poll() adds SBI responses to the event list for further
processing, then ogs_timer_mgr_expire() is called which will add an
additional event for timer expiration. When all events are processed
one-by-one, the SBI xact would get deleted twice in a row, resulting in
a crash.

  most changes to take effect

* Memory issue on IDR exceptions

* Remove of handling MSIDSN change until DSR is used

* Follow-on up [open5gs#1794](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1794)

* [SBI] Client Request timeout

TS29.500
Ch 6.11 Detection and handling of late arriving requests

In Open5GS, this part was hard-corded.

HTTP2 Client sends a request and waits for 10 seconds.
If no response is received from the HTTP2 Server,
HTTP2 Client performs the exception handling.

In this commit, HTTP2 client sends Header with setting Max-Rsp-Time to 10 seconds.
However, HTTP2 server has not yet been implemented to process this value.
The server is still processing using hard-corded values (10 seconds).

* [MME] Cancel Location while Idle ([open5gs#1797](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1797))

* [AMF,UDM] Add support to subscribe to SDM changes

AMF subscribes to UDM for each registered UE.

At the moment, UDM does not send callback to AMF when any of the UE's
properties in the database changes.
At the moment, AMF does properly parse the ModificationNotification, but
does not do anything useful.

* [SMF] Update PFCP report error situation ([open5gs#1819](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1819))

* Revert the previous commit on [open5gs#1797](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1797)

* Updated SBI module

- Introduced NF_INSTANCE_ID/NF_INSTANCE_TYPE
- Skip SCP in configuration validation

* [AMF] Increase size of TMSI pool

Each UE context has 'current' and 'next' TMSI values. AMF first
allocates the 'next' value, before confirming it and releasing the
'previous'. This means that we potentially need pool size of 2x the
amount of maximum configured UE.

Without this change, AMF would crash in case that there are 'x'
configured maximum amount of UE, and there are already 'x' registered
UE.

* [AMF] Reject registration requests when pool for UE contexts is empty

AMF does not crash anymore when a new UE registration request arrives,
and there is no available space left in UE context pool. Now it just
rejects the request with an error.

* [SBI] Do not send empty arrays when registering to NRF

OpenAPI dictates that certain arrays should have at least one item,
otherwise they should not be present.
This includes lists for IPv4/v6 addresses, TAI/TAC lists, ...

Add a check if there is at least 1 item, before creating an array.
Also move variable declarations to inner blocks, to prevent some
accidental usage out of wanted scope.

* [SBI] Case-Insensitive inside MIME message ([open5gs#1939](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/1939))

* [UPF] Add metrics support

Expose metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
UPF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

5qi is not available in UPF.
To present 5qi to the user, MN will have to maintain a table qfi->5qi
for each QoS flow (will have to get information from SMF).
So UPF has to expose qfi. qfi itself is not useful. When used, UPF will
have to expose additional label to define the session (e.g. source
interface).

Label dnn is set to value of APN/DNN received in Establishment.
Since SMF does not add APN/DNN to Establishment, the label is empty.
When APN/DNN will be set by SMF, it should be added to sess in UPF
and used in metrics on Modification and Deletion.

Both datavolumeqosleveln3upf are exposed in bytes.
MN is providing the transformation to kbits.

fivegs_upffunction_upf_qosflows should expose the number of QFIs used in
sessions, but exposes number of QER rules, which is currently equal to
QFIs.
The label snsssai is not provided since the slice is not available on UPF.

Exposed metrics example:
Standard counters:
fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_indatapktn3upf 28637
fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_outdatapktn3upf 14729
fivegs_upffunction_sm_n4sessionestabreq 4

fivegs_ep_n3_gtp_outdatavolumeqosleveln3upf{qfi="1"} 737548
Nonstandard gauge (added for controlling purposes -
same metric as existing metric on AMF and SMF):
fivegs_upffunction_upf_sessionnbr 1
Standard gauge:
fivegs_upffunction_upf_qosflows{dnn=""} 1

* [PCF] Add metrics support

Expose metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
PCF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

AM policy:
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq and
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassosucc do not expose snssai label
since it is not available at the time of exposure.
plmnid is defined during AM policy processing, so not to lose the
difference to ...succ, the basic metric
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq is preserved.

SM policy:
snssai is defined during SM policy processing, so not to lose the
difference to ...succ, the basic metric
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq is preserved.

Those 2 basic metrics retain their position but are exposed with empty
labels.
Metrics with labels are called later, when the label values are known.

Exposed metrics example:
-standard counters:
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq{plmnid=""} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassoreq{plmnid="99970"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policyamassosucc{plmnid="99970"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq{plmnid="",snssai=""} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassoreq{plmnid="99970",snssai="1000009"} 3
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_policysmassosucc{plmnid="99970",snssai="1000009"} 3

-nonstandard gauge (added for controlling purposes -
same metric as existing metric on AMF and SMF):
fivegs_pcffunction_pa_sessionnbr{plmnid="99970",snssai="1000009"} 0

* [SMF] fix crash due free-ing invalid pointer

In case that database is (manually) corrupted for a specific UE, SSC
mode and ARP preemption vulnerability fields are not set correctly,
SMF will crash when trying to build a request to create PCF association.

Function smf_npcf_smpolicycontrol_build_create() will end prematurely,
and when cleaning up resources it will try to free() up invalid pointer,
which was not set to 0 at beginning of the function.

* [AMF] Add RM metrics support

Expose RM metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
AMF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

RegInitFail is exposed as an alternative to RegInitReq and RegInitSucc
counters so cause label can be provided. It counts rejected registrations
and rejected authentications.
Rejected authentications are counted under label cause="0".

Exposed metrics example:
-standard gauge:
fivegs_amffunction_rm_registeredsubnbr{plmnid="00101",snssai="1000009"} 1

-nonstandard counter:
fivegs_amffunction_rm_reginitfail{cause="3"} 4

* [SMF] Add SM metrics support

Expose SM metrics with labels according to ETSI TS 128 552 V16.13.0 in
SMF by using hash.

The metrics are named respecting the rule:
<generation>_<measurement_object_class>_<measurement_family_name>_<metric_name_as_in_TS_128_552>
Existing gauge sessions_active is renamed!

Since slice itself is not unique, the plmnid label is exposed in
addition to snssai.

Exposed metrics example:
-standard gauges:
fivegs_smffunction_sm_sessionnbr{plmnid="00101",snssai="1000009"} 0
fivegs_smffunction_sm_qos_flow_nbr{plmnid="00101",snssai="1000009",fiveqi="9"} 0

* Add NF load to NRF Heartbeat

The current load percentage of the NF Service Consumer is provided
in the payload body of the PATCH request when periodically
contacting the NRF (heart-beat).

AMF: ratio between currently connected ran_ue and maximum number of them
SMF: ratio between current PDU sessions and maximum available
PCF: ratio between current AM+SM policy associations and maximum available
     or ratio between currently connected UEs and maximum number of them
     (the load which is higher)
AUSF, UDM: ratio between currently connected UE and maximum number of them
BSF: ratio between current sessions and maximum available
NSSF: ratio between currently used NSIs and maximum number of them

NRF currently doesn't determine that the NF Profile has changed.

* [SMF] Fix metric bearers_active

Metric 'bearers_active' was incremented in only one code path
(smf_bearer_add() for 4G only), while it was decremented from two paths
(smf_bearer_remove() for both 4G and 5G).
Increment metric also for 5G path (smf_qos_flow_add()), so it won't get
decremented into negative values.

* [mongo] Use "ping" command instead of "serverStatus"

"serverStatus" on the "admin" database may fail due to insufficient privileges.

* Introduced Subscription identifier de-concealing

Incrased MAX_CC_REQUESTER_NUMBER from 32 to 64

* [NF] Fix double-free crash when NF is under heavy load

<nf>/init.c:<nf>_main() :
ogs_pollset_poll() receives the time of the expiration of next timer as
an argument. If this timeout is in very near future (1 millisecond),
and if there are multiple events that need to be processed by
ogs_pollset_poll(), these could take more than 1 millisecond for
processing, resulting in the timer already passed the expiration.

In case that another NF is under heavy load and responds to an SBI
request with some delay of a few seconds, it can happen that
ogs_pollset_poll() adds SBI responses to the event list for further
processing, then ogs_timer_mgr_expire() is called which will add an
additional event for timer expiration. When all events are processed
one-by-one, the SBI xact would get deleted twice in a row, resulting in
a crash.

If the "active flag" is set in the TAU request message or
the MME chooses to establish radio bearers when there is pending downlink
UP data or pending downlink signalling, radio bearers will be established
as part of the TAU procedure and a KeNB derivation is necessary.
