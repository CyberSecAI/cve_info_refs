Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Videojs HTML5 Player plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before displaying them on a page. Specifically, the `url` attribute of the `[videojs_video]` shortcode is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not sanitize the input provided through the shortcode attributes.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** The plugin outputs the unsanitized shortcode attributes directly into the HTML of the page without proper encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website by including crafted shortcodes.
*   When a user views the page containing the malicious shortcode, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser.
*   This allows the attacker to potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker leverages the plugin's shortcode functionality by inserting a specially crafted `[videojs_video]` shortcode into a page or post.
*   The vulnerable attribute is `url`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role in WordPress. This allows them to create and modify posts/pages containing the malicious shortcode.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Shortcode:** `[videojs_video url='" onerror=alert(/XSS/) "']`
*   The vulnerability lies in the way the plugin processes the `url` attribute in the shortcode.  The attacker injects `'" onerror=alert(/XSS/) "'` as a value for this attribute, which triggers the XSS when rendered.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.9 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79, which refers to Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
*   The CVSS score is 6.8 (medium).
