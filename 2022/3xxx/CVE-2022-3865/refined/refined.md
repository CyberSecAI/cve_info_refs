- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or other malicious activities within the database.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/users.php?page=wpus_merger` with a malicious `ID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a user with at least the 'admin' role.
