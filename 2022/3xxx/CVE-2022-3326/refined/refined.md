Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3326:

**Summary:** The provided content details the implementation of a password strength validation using the `zxcvbn` library in the `rdiffweb` application. This commit addresses CVE-2022-3326.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of a strong password policy. Previous versions of `rdiffweb` did not enforce a minimum password strength. The commit adds validation using `zxcvbn` to ensure that newly created or changed passwords meet a specified complexity score.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate password complexity enforcement

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Weak passwords could be easily guessed or cracked, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise of user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Brute-force attacks: Attackers can use readily available tools and techniques to try common and weak passwords.
- Dictionary attacks: Attackers could use word lists and common passwords to try gaining access to accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the system login and try password combinations.

**Technical Details:**
- **zxcvbn Integration:** The commit integrates the `zxcvbn` library into `rdiffweb`. This library estimates password strength based on various factors like common patterns, dictionary words, and character combinations.
- **Password Score Configuration:** A new configuration option, `password-score`, is introduced, which allows administrators to set a minimum score a password must achieve to be considered valid. This value is between 0 and 4, with higher values representing greater complexity requirements. The default value is set to 2 in the configuration.
- **Password Validation:**
  - During user creation and password changes, the system now calls the `zxcvbn` library to calculate the password score.
  - If the calculated score is below the configured `password-score`, the system rejects the password, returning an error message to the user.
  - The error message also includes feedback from `zxcvbn`, indicating what is weak about the password and suggesting improvements.
- **Code Changes:**
  - The following files were modified to implement this fix: `README.md`, `debian/control`, `doc/configuration.md`, `rdiffweb/controller/page_admin.py`, `rdiffweb/controller/pref_general.py`, `rdiffweb/controller/tests/test_page_admin.py`, `rdiffweb/controller/tests/test_page_prefs.py`, `rdiffweb/core/config.py`, `rdiffweb/core/store.py` and `setup.cfg`.
  - The `debian/control` file was modified to include `python3-zxcvbn` as a dependency.
  - The `doc/configuration.md` file is updated to describe the `password-score` configuration option.
  - The files `rdiffweb/controller/page_admin.py` and `rdiffweb/controller/pref_general.py` were modified to remove password length validation and perform validation with zxcvbn score.
  - The `rdiffweb/controller/tests/test_page_admin.py` and `rdiffweb/controller/tests/test_page_prefs.py` were modified to reflect the changes.
  - The `rdiffweb/core/config.py` was modified to add configuration options for password validation.
  - The `rdiffweb/core/store.py` was modified to add `zxcvbn` password validation during set and update user password functions.
  - The `setup.cfg` file was modified to add `zxcvbn` as a required dependency.

**Additional Notes:**
- This fix also includes a change to the `README.md` file referencing this CVE.
- This commit addresses both CVE-2022-3326 and CVE-2022-3292
