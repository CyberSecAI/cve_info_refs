- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the plugin's settings without the victim's consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the plugin's settings by tricking a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request. Specifically, they can add IP addresses to the block list, potentially causing denial-of-service to legitimate users, or other malicious modifications to the settings of the "Login Block IPs" plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the plugin's settings update endpoint. This page is then delivered to the victim, who must be a logged-in administrator on the affected WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to get a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious web page controlled by the attacker. They do not need any authentication or access to the WordPress site.
