| Summary Hi, developers of Bento4: I tested the binary Avcinfo with my fuzzer, and a crash incurred—heap-buffer-overflow. The following is the details. I think this error is different from both [#731](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/issues/731) and [#610](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/issues/610). Bug Detected heap-buffer-overflow in Avcinfo.  ``` root@4w41awdas71:/# ./Bento4/cmakebuild/avcinfo fuzz-avcinfo/out/crashes/POC_avcinfo_15644345 ================================================================= ==708228==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x602000000011 at pc 0x0000004fb133 bp 0x7ffea9099cb0 sp 0x7ffea9099ca8 READ of size 1 at 0x602000000011 thread T0     #0 0x4fb132 in main (/Bento4/cmakebuild/avcinfo+0x4fb132)     #1 0x7fa90b673c86 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21c86)     #2 0x41d5a9 in _start (/Bento4/cmakebuild/avcinfo+0x41d5a9)  0x602000000011 is located 0 bytes to the right of 1-byte region [0x602000000010,0x602000000011) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x4f58a8 in operator new[](unsigned long) /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_new_delete.cpp:102     #1 0x4fb503 in AP4_DataBuffer::SetDataSize(unsigned int) (/Bento4/cmakebuild/avcinfo+0x4fb503)  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow (/Bento4/cmakebuild/avcinfo+0x4fb132) in main Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c047fff7fb0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c047fff7fc0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c047fff7fd0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c047fff7fe0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c047fff7ff0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0c047fff8000: fa fa[01]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8010: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8020: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8030: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8040: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8050: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb   Shadow gap:              cc ==708228==ABORTING   ``` POC [POC\_avcinfo\_15644345.zip](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/files/9658653/POC_avcinfo_15644345.zip) Environment Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (docker) clang 12.0.1 clang++ 12.0.1 Bento4 master branch([5b7cc25](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/commit/5b7cc2500d514717a64675fcf631939494c074ce)) && Bento4 release version([1.6.0-639](https://www.bok.net/Bento4/binaries/Bento4-SDK-1-6-0-639.x86_64-unknown-linux.zip)) Credit Xudong Cao ([NCNIPC of China](http://www.nipc.org.cn/)) Jiayuan Zhang ([NCNIPC of China](http://www.nipc.org.cn/)) Han Zheng ([NCNIPC of China](http://www.nipc.org.cn/), [Hexhive](http://hexhive.epfl.ch/))  Thank you for your time! |
