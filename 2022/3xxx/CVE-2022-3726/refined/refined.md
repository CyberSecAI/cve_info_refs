  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The sanitization of a swagger openapi viewer does not exclude the `form` tag.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-provided OpenAPI specifications, which allows for the inclusion of HTML `form` tags. This enables attackers to inject arbitrary HTML forms into the rendered OpenAPI documentation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can trick users into performing unintended actions by crafting malicious OpenAPI documents that include HTML forms. When a user interacts with these forms (e.g., clicking 'Try it out' and 'Execute'), they unknowingly submit requests to the server with attacker-controlled parameters. This could lead to account privilege escalation (e.g., adding the attacker to admin or private group), adding SSH keys, or other unauthorized actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious OpenAPI specification. An attacker crafts a YAML file containing the malicious form, uploads it to a GitLab project, and then tricks another user into viewing it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to upload files to a GitLab project (or otherwise influence the content of OpenAPI documents). They also need to convince a victim to view the crafted file and interact with it."
