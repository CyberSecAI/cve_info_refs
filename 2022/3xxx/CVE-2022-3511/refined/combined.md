## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Awesome Support < 6.1.2 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Exported Tickets Download

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that the exported tickets archive to be downloaded belongs to the user making the request, allowing a low privileged user, such as subscriber to download arbitrary exported tickets via an IDOR vector

### Proof of Concept

As a low privilege user, open a ticket and export it (via the Profile page), then copy its download URL and change the file parameter to download other user ticket exports
