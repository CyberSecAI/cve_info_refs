- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly verify if the exported tickets archive being requested belongs to the user making the request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). A low-privileged user can access resources that do not belong to them by manipulating the file parameter in the download URL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low-privileged user (e.g., subscriber) can download exported tickets of other users, potentially gaining access to sensitive information contained within the tickets.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the "file" parameter in the exported ticket download URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered user with low privileges (e.g., subscriber) and have the ability to export their own tickets to obtain a valid download URL. They then modify the download URL to access other users' exported tickets.
