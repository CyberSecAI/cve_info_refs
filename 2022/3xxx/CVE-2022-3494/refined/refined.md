Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Complianz plugin fails to sanitize translations, allowing a translator to inject arbitrary SQL code through a translation string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The core vulnerability is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by inserting malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the ability to extract user email addresses from the database by using the `group_concat` and `user_email` functions.
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary SQL queries, potentially enabling a complete compromise of the database, leading to data modification, deletion, or further exploitation of the system.
- **Information Leakage**: The results of the SQL injection are displayed on the site's frontend inside the cookie popup, which results in information leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Translation Files:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL through a compromised translation file.
- **Translator Role:** A user with a translator role can inject SQL by editing translations through translation plugins such as Loco Translate or WPML.
- **POST Request to /wp-admin/admin.php:** The attacker crafts a specific POST request to trigger the execution of the injected SQL during the Complianz wizard's last step.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Translator Access:** The attacker must have a user account with a "translator" role on the WordPress site.
- **Ability to Edit Translations:** The attacker needs the capability to edit translations within the WordPress environment, typically through a translation plugin.
- **HTTP Request Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

- **Specific Plugin Settings:** The vulnerability is triggered when specific options are set in the Complianz plugin wizard ("Does your website use cookies for advertising?" = yes and "Are any of your advertising cookies used to show personalized ads?" = yes).
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Complianz Free versions prior to 6.3.4 and Premium versions prior to 6.3.6.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed in the mentioned versions of the plugin.
