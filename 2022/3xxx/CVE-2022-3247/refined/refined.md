- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks for an AJAX action and fails to validate that the requested URL is external.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user, such as a subscriber, can make the server perform requests to internal URLs. This could be leveraged to access internal resources, potentially leading to further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious AJAX request to the `b2s_scrape_url` action and providing an internal URL as the target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (at least a subscriber) and have access to the WordPress admin panel where the plugin's dashboard is located.
