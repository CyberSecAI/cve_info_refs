## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Jeeng Push Notifications < 2.0.4 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Account ID" setting of the plugin and save: "><img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the settings again
