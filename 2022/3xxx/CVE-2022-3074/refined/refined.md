- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize the slider Name field, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of other users when they access the affected page. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting the XSS payload into the "Name" field of a slider within the plugin's admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or higher in the WordPress site. The attacker would need to be able to create or edit a slide.
