- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF checks and does not validate uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  -  Arbitrary File Upload: The vulnerability allows any authenticated user, including a subscriber, to upload arbitrary files.
  -  Missing authorization checks: The plugin does not properly verify if a user is authorized to perform file uploads.
  -  Missing CSRF checks: The plugin does not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
  -  Lack of file validation: The plugin does not validate the type or content of uploaded files, allowing for the upload of malicious files like PHP scripts.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including executable scripts, to the server. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), full server compromise, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves submitting a crafted POST request to the vulnerable admin-ajax.php endpoint with a file to upload. The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least subscriber privileges.
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged in user with at least subscriber role.
