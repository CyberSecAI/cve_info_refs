Implementation

In this step, any necessary immediate measures are implemented, and long-term measures are planned.

Publication

The publication of the results and measures will be available on this page.

## Security Advisory

#### FDS102 for FAdC®/FAdC®i remote code execution vulnerability

Publication Date: 11.12.2023

CVE-ID: CVE-2023-5500

CVSS Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CWE-ID: CWE-94

**Summary**
Frauscher Sensortechnik GmbH FDS102 for FAdC®/FAdC®i v2.10.1 is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via manipulated parameters of the web interface by using an authenticated session cookie.
This could lead to a full compromise of the FDS102 device.

Affected versions
v2.10.0 and v2.10.1 FDS102 versions

**Mitigation**
Security-related application conditions SecRAC
The railway operator must ensure that only authorised personnel or people in the company of authorised personnel have access to the Frauscher Diagnostic System FDS102.
The recommendation is to connect the Frauscher Diagnostic System FDS102 to a network of category 2. If the Frauscher Diagnostic System FDS102 is connected to a network of category 3
(according to EN 50159:2010), then additional protective measures must be added.

**Remediation**
Update to FDS102 v2.10.2 or higher

#### FDS101 for FAdC®/FAdC®i remote code execution vulnerability

#### FDS101 for FAdC®/FAdC®i path traversal vulnerability

#### FDS101 for FAdC®/FAdC®i SQL injection vulnerability

#### FDS001 for FAdC®/FAdC®i path traversal vulnerability

#### FDS102 for FAdC® R2 and FAdC®i R2 configuration upload vulnerability
