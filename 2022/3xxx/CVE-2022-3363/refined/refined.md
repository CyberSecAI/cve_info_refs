The provided content relates to CVE-2022-3363.

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of email notifications when enabling or disabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Absence of user notification for MFA status changes: The system did not notify users via email when their MFA was enabled or disabled. This lack of notification can lead to a security risk, as users might be unaware of changes to their account's security settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential lack of awareness: Users might be unaware of changes to their MFA status, which can leave them vulnerable to unauthorized access if MFA is unexpectedly disabled, or create confusion if it is unexpectedly enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious user or insider: An attacker with access to user management could enable or disable MFA without the user's knowledge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to user management: The attacker must have administrative or privileged access to modify user settings, specifically MFA status.
- Ability to modify system settings: The attacker does not need any specific software or tools but will need the ability to change user settings in the application.
