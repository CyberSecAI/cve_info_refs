  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient input validation on the ‘template’ attribute used in shortcodes. Attackers can supply arbitrary paths using traversal (../../) to access and include files outside of the intended directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
       "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access and include files outside of the intended directory. If an attacker can successfully upload a php file, remote code execution via inclusion may also be possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Shortcode template attribute manipulation"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have at least contributor level permissions to create or modify content with shortcodes."
