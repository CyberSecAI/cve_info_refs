- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or other malicious actions. In this specific PoC, the attacker is able to extract the `user_login` field from the `wp_users` table.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via the `edit_row` parameter in the `wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpcc_add_new` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator.
