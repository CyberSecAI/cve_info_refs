- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks nonce checks, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to create a new page and modify its content.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, creates a new page with attacker-controlled content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the crafted form. This requires no specific privileges other than convincing the admin to load the attacker's crafted page.
