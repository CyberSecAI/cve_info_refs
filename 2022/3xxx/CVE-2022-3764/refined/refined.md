Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization or filtering of user-supplied parameters in the `delete_entries` function of the Form Vibes WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `ids` parameter within the `params` JSON payload is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of unsanitized user input in a SQL query. This vulnerability is present in the `delete_entries` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data within the database (e.g., user information, other form data), modify data, or even take control of the database server.
- The provided proof of concept shows that a successful SQL injection can lead to the deletion of entries. However, the vulnerability can also allow the attacker to perform other actions depending on the database privileges.
- In this specific case, with the provided proof of concept, a successful exploitation can lead to deleting database entries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP requests to the WordPress admin panel.
- Specifically, the vulnerable function `delete_entries` is accessed through a request containing a `params` parameter, which is expected to be a JSON object with an `ids` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (Admin+) to access the Form Vibes tab and trigger the vulnerable `delete_entries` function.
- The attacker needs to intercept and modify HTTP requests to the WordPress admin panel.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter and function (`params` and `delete_entries`).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Form Vibes versions prior to 1.4.6
- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.8
