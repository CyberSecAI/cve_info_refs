## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Form Vibes < 1.4.6 - Admin+ SQLi

### Description

The "delete\_entries" function does not filter parameters from the request. This leads to an SQL Injection vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept

- Create a submission using the Contact From 7 plugin.
- On the Form Vibes tab in the dashboard, click "submissions" and implement the delete function on an entry.
- Intercept the request and send it to repeater in Burp suite.
- Change the parameter "params" to: {"ids":["9) AND (1=2);-- -"]}
- Send the request, we get this response: {"status":"failed","message":"Could not able to delete Entries"}
- Change the parameter "params" to: {"ids":["9) AND (1=1);-- -"]}
- Send the request, the response this time is the following: {"status":"passed","message":"Entries Deleted"}
