This commit fixes a crash in the BlueZ Bluetooth stack monitor when using the J-Link backend.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A regression introduced by a previous commit ("monitor: Fix memory leaks") caused the J-Link shared library handle to be closed prematurely using `dlclose()`. This would lead to a crash when the code attempted to use symbols from the library after it was closed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Premature closing of a shared library handle.
- Use-after-free condition on J-Link library symbols.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the Bluetooth monitor process, possibly leading to service disruption and/or denial of service for the Bluetooth functionality depending on the usage of the monitor.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by using the monitor with the J-Link backend. No specific user interaction is required other than having the monitor enabled using J-Link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to configure and use the Bluetooth monitor with the J-Link backend.
