## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Advanced WP Columns <= 2.0.6 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the plugin setting (in input boxes): "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script> to get the XSS trigger.

### Affects Plugins
