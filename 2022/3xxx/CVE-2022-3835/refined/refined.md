- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, allowing for stored XSS attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users who access those settings. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user (e.g., admin) and inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings through input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin or similar high-level privileges to access and modify the plugin's settings.
