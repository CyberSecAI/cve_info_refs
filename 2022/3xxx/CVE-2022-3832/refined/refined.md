The provided content relates to CVE-2022-3832.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "External Media" does not properly sanitize and escape its settings, specifically within the Google Drive configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with administrative privileges (or other high-privilege users) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings.
- The injected script will execute within the browsers of other users who access the WordPress dashboard or the affected parts of the site, leading to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or arbitrary actions in the context of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have administrative or other high-privilege access to the WordPress dashboard.
- The attacker navigates to the plugin's settings page, specifically the Google Drive configuration.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the "Client ID" and "Application ID" input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- High-privilege user access to the WordPress admin dashboard (e.g., Administrator).
- Ability to access and modify the settings of the "External Media" plugin.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the plugin does not sanitize or escape user-supplied data in the plugin settings.
- This vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved in the database and executed later when the settings page is accessed.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0.36 of the plugin.
