## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# External Media < 1.0.36 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Open the settings page of the plugin.
2. On the setting page of this plugin, Select 'GoogleDrive' on the left side of the page.
3. Enter the following value on both the input box named 'Client ID' and the input box named 'Application ID'. The value is: 123';alert(/XSS/); '
