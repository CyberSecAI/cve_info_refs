## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Livemesh Addons for Elementor < 7.2.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Enter the setting page of this plugin.
2. In the input boxes named "Theme Color" and "Theme Hover Color", enter the following value in the box. The value is: #fc0000" onmouseenter=alert(1) "
3. Click the 'Save Changes' button on the page.
4. Refresh or re-enter the page and move the mouse over the input box to get the XSS trigger.
