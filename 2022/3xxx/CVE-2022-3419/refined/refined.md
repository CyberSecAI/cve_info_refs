Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Automatic User Roles Switcher" lacks proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inadequate Authorization:** The plugin does not properly restrict access to the user role modification functionality.
    *   **Missing CSRF Protection:** Absence of CSRF checks allows malicious requests to be forged and executed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A low-privileged authenticated user (e.g., a subscriber) can escalate their privileges to that of an administrator, gaining full control of the WordPress site.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted request to the profile update page (wp-admin/profile.php). This is demonstrated by simply modifying user role checkboxes and updating the user profile, which in turn makes the user an admin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a valid account on the WordPress site, even a subscriber role will do.
    *   The attacker needs to access the profile page of the WordPress admin panel.
