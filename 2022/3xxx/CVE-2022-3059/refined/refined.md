- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  SQL injection vulnerability due to a vulnerable parameter in the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple instances of SQL injection (both authenticated and unauthenticated) were present. The application also supported stacked queries, which allowed more complex SQL commands to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially extract data from the database using sleep-based inferential SQL injection.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through a vulnerable parameter in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable parameter. The vulnerability was exploitable both with and without authentication.
