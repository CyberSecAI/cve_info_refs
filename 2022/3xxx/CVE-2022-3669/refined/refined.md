Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1 (Memory Leak in `mp4edit`)**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory leak occurs when parsing a specific MP4 file.
*   **Weakness:** Unreleased dynamically allocated memory. Specifically, memory allocated within `AP4_AtomFactory::CreateAtomFromStream` is not being freed properly during the processing of the provided test case.
*   **Impact:** Memory consumption increases, which can lead to application instability or denial of service if the application is processing many of these files.
*  **Attack Vector:** Processing a maliciously crafted MP4 file using `mp4edit`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious MP4 file as an input to `mp4edit`.

**Vulnerability 2 (Memory Leak in `mp4edit`)**

*   **Root Cause:** A different memory leak during the parsing of another crafted MP4 file.
*   **Weakness:** Similar to the first vulnerability, dynamically allocated memory is not properly released. Specifically, the leak is triggered when an `AP4_AvccAtom` is created which involves calls in `AP4_SampleEntry::Read` and `AP4_StsdAtom` processing.
*   **Impact:** Same as the first memory leak - increased memory consumption leading to potential instability or DoS.
*   **Attack Vector:** Providing a specific crafted MP4 file to the `mp4edit` tool.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to `mp4edit`.

**Vulnerability 3 (Heap-buffer-overflow in `mp42hevc`)**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap buffer overflow during the processing of a crafted MP4 input in `mp42hevc`. Specifically, a write operation goes beyond the allocated buffer within the `WriteSample` function, when handling the sample data.
*   **Weakness:**  Out-of-bounds write due to incorrect buffer size calculation in `AP4_DataBuffer::SetDataSize` or when writing to the `AP4_DataBuffer` in  `WriteSample`.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to application crash, arbitrary code execution or other unexpected behavior.
*   **Attack Vector:** Providing a crafted MP4 file to the `mp42hevc` tool.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to `mp42hevc`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes specific crash logs from AddressSanitizer (ASan) which pinpoint the locations of the bugs.
*   The content includes proof-of-concept (POC) files.
*   The issues were discovered using fuzzing techniques.
*   The bugs were found in the Bento4 library, specifically in `mp4edit` and `mp42hevc` tools.
