## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Team Members < 5.2.1 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escapes some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as editors to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example, in a multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the "Teams" section » add a new team and in the "Main color" option, add the payload: " onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//
2. Publish/Update the page » click on the "Main color" option and hover the mouse over the input field to trigger the XSS.
