{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the `noteables_for_type` method in `app/finders/notes_finder.rb` not performing proper project checks when creating notes for personal snippets. By manipulating the `noteable_type` POST parameter to `personal_snippet`, an attacker can bypass the intended project scope and create notes on a victim's private personal snippets.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Inadequate access control leading to unauthorized modification of notes on private personal snippets.",
    "Lack of proper validation of the `noteable_type` parameter, allowing attackers to bypass intended project scope.",
    "Information disclosure through activity feeds, leaking the title of private personal snippets."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create, edit, and delete notes on a victim's private personal snippets. The title of the private snippet is leaked on the attacker's activity feed. This can also be used to potentially target users in a social engineering attack. If the attacker makes their project public or internal and uses a label or references the issue in the comment, the victim will be able to see the label from the attacker's project.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is achieved by manipulating the POST parameters when creating or editing a note via the GitLab web interface. Specifically, changing the `noteable_type` parameter to `personal_snippet` and the `target_id` to the victim's private snippet ID.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a GitLab account and the ability to create a project. They also need to know the ID of the victim's private personal snippet. They do not need to have any prior relationship with the victim."
