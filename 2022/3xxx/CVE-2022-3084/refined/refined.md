This document provides details on multiple vulnerabilities affecting GE CIMPLICITY software, including CVE-2022-3084.

**CVE-2022-3084 Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824)
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability occurs when data from a faulting address controls code flow starting at `gmmiObj!CGmmiRootOptionTable`.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access, user interaction required.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs local access to the system and user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **Affected Product:** GE CIMPLICITY versions 2022 and prior
*   **Mitigation:** GE recommends referring to the CIMPLICITY Secure Deployment Guide, specifically sections 3.5 (Projects) and 4.2 (CimView).

**Additional Vulnerabilities described in the document:**
*   **CVE-2022-2952:** Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824) - Similar to CVE-2022-3084, but with code flow controlled at `gmmiObj!CGmmiOptionContainer`
*   **CVE-2022-2948:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122).
