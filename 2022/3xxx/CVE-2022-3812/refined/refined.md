      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "Memory leaks due to improper resource management in Bento4's MP4 processing tools, specifically within the `AP4_AtomFactory::CreateAtomFromStream`, `AP4_ContainerAtom::ReadChildren`, and related functions.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Memory Leak: Unfreed memory is allocated during the processing of MP4 files, leading to memory exhaustion over time."
        ],
        "impact": "Memory exhaustion can occur if the vulnerable tools are used to process a large number of specially crafted or malformed MP4 files, potentially leading to denial of service.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Malicious MP4 files can be crafted to trigger the memory leaks when processed by affected Bento4 utilities (mp4encrypt, mp4edit, mp4decrypt, mp4mux)."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MP4 file or a series of MP4 files to the vulnerable Bento4 utilities.  The attacker requires access to the system or application that processes MP4 files using the affected Bento4 tools."
