- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some parameters before using them in an SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with admin privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `posts_values[]` parameter in the POST request when exporting a CSV file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator.
