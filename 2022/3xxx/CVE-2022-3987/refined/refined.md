- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user views or previews a page or post containing the crafted shortcode. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, and potentially taking control of the affected website.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a malicious shortcode with crafted attributes into a page or post.
