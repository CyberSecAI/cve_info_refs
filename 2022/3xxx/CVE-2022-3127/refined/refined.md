The provided content is related to a commit in the `drawio` repository, specifically addressing changes in version 20.2.8. The commit message mentions: "Restricts proxy servlet, java disabled by default, all errors are 500 (not distinguishable), allow ports only by config [CSP-633]". This indicates changes to the `ProxyServlet.java` and `Utils.java` files, which handle proxy requests within the drawio application. These changes are related to a security concern, likely related to CVE-2022-3127.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant changes:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure proxy servlet that could potentially be used to make requests to arbitrary URLs. This can be exploited to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Proxy:** The `ProxyServlet` previously allowed fetching content from any URL, as long as it passed a basic sanitization check. This allowed an attacker to potentially bypass network restrictions or access sensitive internal resources.
*   **Lack of Port Restriction:** The proxy servlet did not previously restrict allowed ports, making it more vulnerable to exploitation.
*   **Error Handling:** The servlet returned generic 500 errors for various issues, which could hide specific details of the issue from the attacker, but also from security teams.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could use the proxy to scan internal networks, access internal services, and potentially bypass firewalls.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive information from internal resources could be retrieved via the proxy.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker might exploit the proxy to cause a DoS attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker sends a malicious `url` parameter to the `ProxyServlet` that points to an internal or otherwise sensitive URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the drawio application's proxy servlet.

**Changes Made to Mitigate the Vulnerability:**

*   **Proxy Disabled by Default:** The proxy is now disabled unless the `ENABLE_DRAWIO_PROXY` environment variable is set to "1".
*   **Port Restriction:** The proxy only allows connections to ports that are explicitly configured via the `DRAWIO_PROXY_ALLOWED_PORTS` environment variable.
*   **Error Handling:** All errors now result in an HTTP 500 internal server error, however, logging has been improved to assist in identifying any problems with the proxy.

**Specific Code Changes (Relevant to CVE-2022-3127):**

*   **`ProxyServlet.java`**:
    *   The proxy is disabled by default using `if (!"1".equals(System.getenv("ENABLE_DRAWIO_PROXY")))`.
    *   Error handling is modified to return an HTTP 500 error for various issues and logs were added to the errors.
*   **`Utils.java`**:
    *   A new `allowedPorts` set is introduced to specify allowed ports via the `DRAWIO_PROXY_ALLOWED_PORTS` environment variable.
    *   The `sanitizeUrl` method is updated to check if the target URL's port is within the allowed ports set.

These changes provide more control over the proxy servlet and significantly reduce the risk of SSRF attacks.
