Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-3065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insufficient restriction of the proxy servlet in the drawio application. Specifically, the proxy servlet was not properly restricting access to specific ports, and it also did not have proper error handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unrestricted Proxy Servlet:** The proxy servlet was not configured to allow connections only to a specific set of ports. It seems that there was some initial attempt to restrict via environment variables, but the restriction was not in place by default, and errors were handled too broadly.
2.  **Lack of Granular Error Handling**: The proxy servlet was returning generic 500 Internal Server Errors for most issues, masking specific error conditions, such as not found or unsupported type.
3.  **Java Proxy Enabled By Default**: The Java proxy was enabled by default, adding to the attack surface and making it easier for attackers to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially use the unrestricted proxy servlet to make requests to arbitrary internal servers/ports accessible to the drawio application. This could lead to:
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could make requests to internal resources not intended to be exposed, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, or perform internal actions.
    *   **Port Scanning:** By using the proxy to make requests to various ports, an attacker could scan the internal network for open services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through crafted URL parameters provided to the proxy servlet. By manipulating the "url" parameter, an attacker could direct the proxy to make requests to unintended targets.
*   The vulnerability is exposed via HTTP requests to the proxy servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the drawio application where the vulnerable proxy servlet is exposed.
*   The attacker would need a basic understanding of how to construct URLs to target internal resources.
*   The attacker would not need to be inside of the network where the vulnerable server runs.

**Additional Information:**

The provided diffs show that a fix was implemented by:

*   Disabling the Java proxy by default.
*   Restricting the proxy servlet to only allow connections to ports specified in the `DRAWIO_PROXY_ALLOWED_PORTS` environment variable.
*   Changing error responses to be more specific.

The commit message "[CSP-633] Restricts proxy servlet, java disabled by default, all errors are 500 (not distinguishable), allow ports only by config" accurately describes the fix.
