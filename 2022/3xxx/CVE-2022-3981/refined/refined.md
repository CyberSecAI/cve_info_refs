Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Icegram Express plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter (`list_id` and `status[]`) before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this specific PoC, the attacker uses `sleep(5)` to cause a delay, which confirms the vulnerability. The impact is rated as High (CVSS score 7.7) because of the potential to gain access to sensitive database information.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, by sending a crafted request with malicious SQL code within the `list_id` and `status[]` parameters.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated as a subscriber or higher privileged WordPress user.
