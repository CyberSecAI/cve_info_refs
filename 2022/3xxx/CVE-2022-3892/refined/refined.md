- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape Client IDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (Client ID field) when editing or displaying clients.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker, with admin privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Client ID" field when editing a client. This payload is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the client list or edits the client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges or higher to edit clients within the "OAuth Server > Clients" section of the WordPress plugin.
