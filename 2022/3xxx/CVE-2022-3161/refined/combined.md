#### **3.2.1    [STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)**

The APDFL.dll contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that could be triggered while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

[CVE-2022-3159](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3159) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### **3.2.2    [HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)**

The APDFL.dll contains an out-of-bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

[CVE-2022-3160](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3160) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### **3.2.3 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)**

The APDFL.dll contains a memory corruption vulnerability while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

[CVE-2022-3161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3161) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Michael Heinz and Nafiez reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions:

* JT2Go: [Update to V14.1.0.5 or later version](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html).
* Teamcenter Visualization V13.3: [Update to V13.3.0.8 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/).
* Teamcenter Visualization V14.0: [Update to V14.0.0.4 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/).
* Teamcenter Visualization V14.1: [Update to V14.1.0.5 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/).

Siemens identified the following specific workaround and mitigation user can apply to reduce risk:

* Do not open untrusted PDF files in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.

As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Siemens also provides [additional information on industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity).

For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products, users should contact [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories).

For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-360681 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-360681.html) and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-360681.json).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Do not open untrusted PDF files in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT, VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management (PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enterprise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (<https://www.first.org/cvss/>). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
<https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-3159
The APDFL.dll contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that could be triggered while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |

| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow |

Vulnerability CVE-2022-3160
The APDFL.dll contains an out of bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |
