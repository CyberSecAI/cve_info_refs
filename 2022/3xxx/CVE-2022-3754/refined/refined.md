The provided content relates to a commit that addresses a vulnerability in phpMyFAQ, specifically regarding password length requirements.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient minimum password length requirement during password changes and initial setup. The original code allowed passwords shorter than 8 characters, which is considered weak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient password length enforcement. The original code had a minimum password length of 6 characters during installation and no minimum length restriction when changing password using the `pwd.change.php` form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Weak passwords can be easily guessed or brute-forced, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and the application itself.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this by creating a user account with a very short and easily guessable password or changing existing user passwords to short passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authorized user or be in a position to register a new account through the installation page to exploit this vulnerability
- The attacker can exploit the password reset form when logged in to update their password

**Details from the provided diff:**
- **`phpmyfaq/admin/pwd.change.php`:** The commit changes the password validation to check for a minimum password length of 8.
- **`phpmyfaq/src/phpMyFAQ/Installer.php`:** The commit modifies the password length check to ensure new passwords are at least 8 characters long during installation.
