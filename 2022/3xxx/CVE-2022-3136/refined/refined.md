The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3136.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Social Rocket plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high privilege user, like an administrator, can inject malicious scripts that will be stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected pages, even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, and more.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress backend as an administrator. They can then navigate to the plugin's settings page and inject malicious code into the "Text" field of a social button under "Floating Buttons."
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress backend.
