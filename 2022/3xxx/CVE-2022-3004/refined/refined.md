  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The commit introduces multiple instances of missing output escaping in various template files within the YetiForce CRM application. Specifically, user-controlled data such as field names, values, and conditions are inserted into HTML attributes without proper escaping. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Output Sanitization",
      "Missing Output Escaping"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through crafted input, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and other malicious activities when a user interacts with the application. This could result in a range of security issues, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and the spread of malware.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted workflow conditions",
      "Injected field mappings",
      "Manipulated task summaries"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would require the ability to create or modify workflow rules/tasks within the YetiForce CRM. The specific capabilities depend on the application's permissions model.",
    "details": "The commit `cd82ecc` focuses on improving the workflow panel, and introduces several changes to template files such as `AdvanceFilterCondition.tpl`, `CreateEntity.tpl`, `EditTask.tpl`, and `FieldExpressions.tpl`. It adds escape functions to some variables, such as those used in input fields or selected options, but also introduces new unescaped variables directly into HTML attributes. For instance, in `AdvanceFilterCondition.tpl` the `{$FIELD_MODEL->$columnNameApi()}` is used directly in `<option value="...">`, while `{$CONDITION}` is used in `<input type="hidden" name="column_condition" value="...">`. Similar issues exist within the `CreateEntity.tpl`, `EditTask.tpl`, and `FieldExpressions.tpl` templates. These changes result in XSS vulnerabilities."
