- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to actions performed in the context of a victim's browser session such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing a payload that gets executed by the browser when the user visits the page. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `pm_add_group` page is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. No authentication is explicitly required, but it does affect the WordPress admin page, so access to the admin interface is likely to be a requirement. The attack can be performed remotely.
