Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a potential security issue related to the use of Data Source Names (DSN) in the TiDB project, specifically within the `br/pkg/lightning` and `dumpling` components. The commit replaces the direct usage of DSN strings with a more secure configuration object.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The primary issue is that DSN strings, which are used to specify database connection parameters, can potentially expose sensitive information like passwords if not handled carefully. Storing the DSN directly can also make managing complex configurations more challenging and less secure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Exposure of Credentials**: Storing and directly using DSN strings can inadvertently log or expose passwords.
-   **Complexity**: DSN strings can become unwieldy and difficult to manage for more complex connection parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If an attacker gains access to a system where DSN strings are stored or logged, they can potentially gain unauthorized access to the databases, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Configuration File Access:** An attacker could access configuration files or other locations where the DSN strings are stored.
-   **Log Exposure:** The DSN string could be logged, exposing credentials to unauthorized users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker would need access to the system where TiDB or the related utilities are running, or access to logs or configuration files containing the DSNs.

**Technical Details:**

*   The commit introduces a `MySQLConnectParam` struct to encapsulate the various parameters needed to connect to a MySQL database. This includes user, password, host, port, SQL mode, max allowed packet size, and TLS settings. It also includes a `Vars` map for additional connection parameters.
*   The `ToDriverConfig` method on `MySQLConnectParam` creates a `mysql.Config` object, which is a more structured and secure way to manage connection parameters.
*   The `ConnectMySQL` function is modified to accept the `mysql.Config` object and use the `mysql.NewConnector` function for creating database connections rather than the string-based `sql.Open`.
*   The change also adds base64 decoding for the password. If a password is base64 encoded, it will try to decode it before connecting.
*   The changes are applied to the `br/pkg/lightning` and `dumpling` components in areas that deal with database connection initialization.
*   The commit updates the checkpoint and importer components to use `MySQLParam` instead of DSN to handle database connection parameters.
*   The test cases are adjusted to reflect the new approach for creating database connections.

This commit replaces the insecure use of DSN strings with a more secure, configurable, and maintainable approach using `mysql.Config`, preventing potential exposure of credentials.
