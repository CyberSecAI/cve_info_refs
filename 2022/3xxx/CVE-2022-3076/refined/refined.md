{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not properly validate allowed file extensions during upload, allowing admin users to add executable extensions like 'php'.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient validation of file extensions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with admin privileges can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP files, leading to remote code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the plugin's settings interface, where allowed file extensions can be modified. Malicious files are then uploaded via the 'Add New' download functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress site."
