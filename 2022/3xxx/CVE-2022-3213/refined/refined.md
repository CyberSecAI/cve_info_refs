Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-3213

**Root Cause:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in ImageMagick when processing a malformed TIFF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow in `coders/tiff.c` when handling stripped TIFF images. Specifically, the calculation of memory allocation size for `strip_pixels` is flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to undefined behavior, a crash, and a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted, malformed TIFF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malformed TIFF file to an application using ImageMagick.
- User interaction is required as the user has to open or process the malicious TIFF file.
- The attacker does not require any privileges to trigger the vulnerability
- The attack vector is considered local.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is present in the `ReadTIFFImage` function within `coders/tiff.c`. The size of the buffer allocated for `strip_pixels` was incorrectly calculated as `extent=4*(samples_per_pixel+1)*TIFFStripSize(tiff);`. The fix changes this calculation to `extent=4*((image->depth+7)/8)*(samples_per_pixel+1)*TIFFStripSize(tiff);`. The fix takes the image depth into account when calculating the allocation size.

**Affected Versions:**
- ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.0-47
- ImageMagick 6 versions prior to 6.9.12-62

**Patched Versions:**
- ImageMagick 7.1.0-47
- ImageMagick 6.9.12-62

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.5/10, with a high impact on availability, while confidentiality and integrity are not impacted.
- The EPSS score is 0.067%, which is in the 32nd percentile.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).
- The provided content contains the specific code changes that address this vulnerability, highlighting the fix in the memory allocation calculation.
