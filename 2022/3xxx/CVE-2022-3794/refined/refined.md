Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-3794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks in the Jeg Elementor Kit plugin for WordPress when handling various AJAX actions. This means that authenticated users, even those with low privileges, can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-level users. The plugin relies on easily obtainable nonce values instead of proper capability checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated users can bypass intended authorization controls.
- **Inadequate Capability Checks:** The plugin fails to properly verify user permissions before executing AJAX actions.
- **Reliance on Nonces:** The plugin uses nonces for security, which can be easily obtained and reused by authenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with an authenticated user account can:
- Create header templates.
- Make changes to the site.
- Potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network via AJAX requests.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site, but does not require admin privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the site.
- The attacker needs to be able to obtain a valid nonce.
