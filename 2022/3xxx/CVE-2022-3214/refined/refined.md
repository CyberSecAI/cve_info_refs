- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of hard-coded credentials within the Delta Electronics DIAEnergie software. Specifically, hard-coded bearer authorization is used to upload executable files to certain directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798), which are used for authorization, allowing unauthorized access and actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution. An attacker could upload and execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (remote), and the attack complexity is low.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
