- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the program exceeding its maximum allowed iterations when processing long chains of Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper handling or limitation of CA chain lengths within the OctoRPKI application. This allows an attacker to construct a chain that exceeds the `max iterations` parameter, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The program crashes and fails to complete the validation process, thereby impacting its intended function.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can create long chains of CAs, specifically designed to surpass the program's maximum iteration limit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be capable of creating and introducing a manipulated chain of CAs that the vulnerable software will attempt to process. The attacker must have the ability to influence the CA chain that the program processes.
