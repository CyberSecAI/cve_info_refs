- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-controlled input in its settings, specifically the "A custom location" setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the plugin settings page. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, stealing sensitive data, or further compromising the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator and have access to the plugin settings page. The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript payload in the "A custom location" setting. The XSS is triggered when a user accesses the plugin settings page again and moves their mouse over the affected input box.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges.
