The provided content describes two SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `go-ibax` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of `fmt.Sprintf` to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization of user-supplied inputs. Specifically, the `form.Table_name` and `form.Order` parameters are directly inserted into the SQL query string, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it constructs SQL queries using unsanitized user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can potentially modify data in the database by injecting malicious SQL queries (not explicitly demonstrated in provided PoC).
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided PoC demonstrates the use of `pg_sleep` to delay server responses, indicating a potential for DoS attacks.
- **Potential for Full Compromise:** With sufficient SQL injection knowledge and depending on the database permissions, a complete database compromise is possible.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Requests:** Both vulnerabilities are exploitable through HTTP POST requests to specific API endpoints:
  - `https://testnet-hk1.ibax.network:5079/api/v2/open/tablesInfo`
  - `https://testnet-hk1.ibax.network:5079/api/v2/open/columnsInfo`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker must know the vulnerable parameters (`table_name` and `order`) in the HTTP request bodies to inject malicious SQL.
- **Understanding of SQL:** Some basic understanding of SQL is needed to craft the injection payloads.

**Vulnerable Code Locations:**
- `go-ibax/packages/api/database.go#L92`: Vulnerable when querying table information.
- `go-ibax/packages/api/database.go#L120`: Vulnerable when querying column information.

**Example Exploits (POC):**
- TablesInfo endpoint:
`page=1&limit=1&order=1; select pg_sleep(3)--`

- ColumnsInfo endpoint:
`table_name=1; select pg_sleep(3)--`
