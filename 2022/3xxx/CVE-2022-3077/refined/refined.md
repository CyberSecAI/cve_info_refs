The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3077. The commit message and code diff directly address a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `data->block[0]` variable, which comes from the user, is used to determine the size of data written to the `dma_buffer`. This variable was not properly capped, leading to a potential write beyond the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The user-provided `data->block[0]` was not checked against `I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX` before being used to calculate the `wr_len_cmd`.
- Potential buffer overflow: A large value for `data->block[0]` could cause `desc->wr_len_cmd` to exceed the size of the allocated DMA buffer leading to out of bound write, causing memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds write, potentially leading to system instability, crashes, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can provide a malicious value for `data->block[0]` via the I2C interface through the `I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_PROC_CALL` transaction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send I2C commands, specifically an `I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_PROC_CALL` with a carefully crafted `data->block[0]` value to the target system. This implies some level of access to the I2C bus.
