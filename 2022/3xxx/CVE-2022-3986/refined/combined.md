## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Stripe Checkout < 1.2.2.21 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put the following shortcode in a page/post
[wp\_stripe\_checkout item\_name='test' amount='1' currency='" onload=alert(/XSS/) "']
The XSS will be triggered when viewing/previewing the page/post

### Affects Plugins
