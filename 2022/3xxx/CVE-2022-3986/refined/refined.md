- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them onto the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page or post. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting a crafted shortcode into a WordPress page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to add the malicious shortcode.
