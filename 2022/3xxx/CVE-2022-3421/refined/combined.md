# Google Drive for desktop release notes

These release notes reflect additions and improvements in each version of [Google Drive for desktop](/a/answer/7491144) (formerly Drive File Stream). If you see a number between the listed releases, that version has no significant difference from the prior release.

We typically wait until a new version of Drive for desktop is 100% rolled out to existing customers before providing the new app for download. Until we reach 100% roll-out, the Drive for desktop download link provides the prior version.

**Note**: To avoid compatibility issues and service interruptions with Drive for desktop, stay on a version that Google released within the last 12 months. For details, go to [Manage Drive for desktop updates for your users](/a/answer/10514878).
