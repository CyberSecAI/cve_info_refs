Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-3183:

**CVE-2022-3183**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, a function within the Dataprobe iBoot-PDU firmware does not sanitize user-provided input, which can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution on the Dataprobe iBoot-PDU device.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (remote) with low attack complexity.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

This document provides more technical details than the standard CVE description. It specifies that a lack of input sanitization in a particular function of the Dataprobe iBoot-PDU firmware allows for OS command injection. The document also specifies the CVSS v3 score of 9.8 for this vulnerability.
