## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Jetpack CRM < 5.4.3 - Admin+ Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

1. In the settings of the plugin, in the three input boxes are named "Second Address Label", "Login Logo Override", and "Custom CRM Header", enter the payload: 1" onmouseenter=alert(1) "
2. Refresh the page and hover the mouse on the input boxes to get the XSS trigger.
