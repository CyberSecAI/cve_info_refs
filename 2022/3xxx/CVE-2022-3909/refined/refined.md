- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which are then executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This can lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user, such as an administrator, to access the plugin settings page and inject the malicious script. The unfiltered_html capability must be disallowed.
