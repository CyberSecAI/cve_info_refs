## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Add Comments <= 1.0.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,\*/\*;q=0.8

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://testing.local/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=addComments
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 209
Origin: http://testing.local
Connection: close
Cookie: <snip>
