```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `HTTPRequestDecompressor` and `HTTPResponseDecompressor` in SwiftNIO Extras failed to detect when the decompressed body was considered complete. They would repeatedly attempt to decompress trailing junk data after the actual compressed body, leading to an infinite loop.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper detection of complete HTTP body decompression",
    "Infinite loop due to repeated decompression attempts on trailing junk data"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition where the affected process becomes unavailable due to an infinite loop, potentially causing a slow exhaustion of memory resources. The process doesn't immediately crash but becomes unresponsive, and may require manual intervention or an automated circuit breaker to recover.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a compressed HTTP message with trailing junk data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a compressed HTTP message, which is commonly the case for HTTP servers. It is also possible if users have configured decompression for HTTP requests as well. No specific privilege or system access is required to trigger the vulnerability."
