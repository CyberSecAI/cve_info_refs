The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Booking Calendar" WordPress plugin. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The plugin fails to properly validate uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:**  The primary vulnerability is the ability for an unauthenticated user to upload arbitrary files, including potentially malicious PHP files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing a PHP file, an attacker can achieve RCE, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site and its associated server, including data breaches, defacement, and further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of the nonce:** The attacker must extract a valid nonce value from the main WordPress page source to successfully perform the upload.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP POST requests with multipart/form-data encoding.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable plugin version is any version below 3.2.2.
- The file is uploaded to `"/wp-content/uploads/booking_calendar/<filename>"`.
- The vulnerability also affects the "booking-calendar-pro-payment" plugin, fixed in version 21.1.
