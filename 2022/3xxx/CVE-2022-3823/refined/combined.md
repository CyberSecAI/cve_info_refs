## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Beautiful Cookie Consent Banner < 2.9.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

The PoC will be displayed once the issue has been remediated.
