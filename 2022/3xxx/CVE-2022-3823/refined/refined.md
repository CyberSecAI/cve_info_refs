- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be a high privilege user such as an admin. They can then inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will be executed when other users access the affected pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin or similar high-level privileges on the WordPress site.
