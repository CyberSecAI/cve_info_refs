- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugins lack CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting files uploaded at the checkout.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, allowing an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a logged-in shop manager or admin to delete files uploaded during the checkout process. This could lead to data loss or disruption of order processing.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a CSRF attack. The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when visited by a logged-in shop manager or admin, triggers the file deletion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in shop manager or admin into visiting the malicious URL. This usually involves social engineering tactics like sending a link via email or embedding it on a website the victim might visit.
