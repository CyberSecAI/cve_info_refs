## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Evaluate <= 1.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escapes some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example, in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Settings » Evaluate » Add New.
2. Add the payload: <script>alert(1)</script>, and the payload trigger.

### Affects Plugins
