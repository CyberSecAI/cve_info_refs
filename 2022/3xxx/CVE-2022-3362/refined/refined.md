Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of session invalidation upon a user's password change. This means that even after a user changes their password, their existing sessions remain active, posing a security risk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Fixation/Persistence:** The primary vulnerability is the persistence of user sessions after a password change, which allows an attacker to potentially continue using an old session even after the user has changed their password. This is due to the lack of a mechanism to invalidate the old sessions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker who had gained access to a user's account before a password change could potentially maintain access using the old, unexpired session. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could gain access to a user's session through various means like eavesdropping on network traffic or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
- Once the attacker obtains a session, they would maintain access despite password change, until the session naturally expires or is revoked by other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid session for the target user prior to the user changing their password.
-  No specific position in the network or system is mentioned, however, the attacker must have means to obtain session information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit introduces changes to address this vulnerability by revoking a user's previous session upon a password change, preventing the exploitation of persistent sessions.
- The fix includes modifications in `rdiffweb/controller/page_pref_general.py` to refresh and commit the user object, which invalidates the old session after a password change.
- Corresponding changes and tests were also implemented in various modules to handle session revocation and account management.
