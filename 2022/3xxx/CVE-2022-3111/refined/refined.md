Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3111:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `free_charger_irq()` function within the `drivers/power/supply/wm8350_power.c` file of the Linux kernel.
- Specifically, the `free_charger_irq()` function was missing a call to `wm8350_free_irq()` for the `WM8350_IRQ_CHG_FAST_RDY` interrupt, which was previously registered in the `wm8350_init_charger()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. The interrupt `WM8350_IRQ_CHG_FAST_RDY` is allocated but not freed in the `free_charger_irq` function when the charger is disabled. This leads to an accumulation of unfreed memory over time.
- **Missing Resource Release:** The core issue is the lack of proper resource management where a resource (IRQ) allocated for use isn't released after its use is complete.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The memory leak can potentially lead to resource exhaustion over time. If the charger is frequently enabled and disabled, the unreleased memory accumulates and could impact the stability and performance of the system by using up available memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by enabling and disabling the charger functionality handled by the `wm8350_power` driver. An attacker would need to cause these events repeatedly.
- This is a local vulnerability within the kernel, so the attacker would need to have a way to interact with the power management subsystem to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to interact with the power management subsystem to trigger the charger enable/disable functionality.
- **Kernel Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the kernel to cause the memory leak. This implies some level of privileges.

**Additional Details**
- The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in the Linux kernel version 5.18-rc1.
- The upstream commit fixing this issue is: `6dee930f6f6776d1e5a7edf542c6863b47d9f078`
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions up to 5.16-rc6.
- The bug report in Red Hat Bugzilla also confirms the nature of the vulnerability and the upstream fix.
