The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3320, not CVE-2022-3512.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `warp-cli set-custom-endpoint` subcommand within the Cloudflare WARP client. This command allows users to set a custom endpoint for the WARP client. By providing an unreachable endpoint, an attacker can cause the WARP client to disconnect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the client's behavior when provided with an invalid/unreachable custom endpoint which causes disconnection and bypasses configured policies for Zero Trust Secure Web Gateway.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass administrative restrictions enforced by the Zero Trust Secure Web Gateway on an enrolled endpoint. This can result in a loss of integrity and availability for systems protected by Zero Trust.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the affected machine to run the `warp-cli` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must have low-level privileges and user interaction is required, as they need to execute the `warp-cli` command on the target machine.
