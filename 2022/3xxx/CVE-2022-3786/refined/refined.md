{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `ossl_a2ulabel()` function, which handles the conversion of ASCII to Unicode labels in X.509 certificates, has a buffer overflow vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The function does not properly check the output buffer size when processing a domain name with punycode.",
      "The output buffer is not guaranteed to be NUL-terminated in all cases."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a crash (denial of service).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious actor can craft a certificate with a specially crafted email address containing a long sequence of '.' characters within a punycode label.",
      "This can be triggered in a TLS client by connecting to a malicious server, or in a TLS server if client authentication is enabled and a malicious client connects."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to either have a CA sign the malicious certificate or the application must continue certificate verification despite not being able to construct a path to a trusted issuer."

  "additional_details": {
        "affected_versions": "OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.6 are vulnerable.",
