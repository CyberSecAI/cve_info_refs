- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the Google Analytics ID field is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker, with admin privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected pages. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have admin privileges on the WordPress site to inject the malicious payload into the plugin's settings. The payload is injected into the Google Analytics ID field within the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative access to the WordPress site.
