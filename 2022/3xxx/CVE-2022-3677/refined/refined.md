- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Advanced Import plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when installing and activating plugins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability allowing unauthorized plugin installation and activation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to install arbitrary plugins from WordPress.org and activate arbitrary plugins already present on the blog, potentially leading to complete site compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via CSRF. An attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted form via a malicious web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
