- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF protection for certain AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization and CSRF protection in AJAX actions. This allows any logged-in user, including subscribers, to execute these actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disable the app functionality by exploiting the vulnerability via the affected AJAX action.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user (even a low-privileged subscriber role is enough). They need to be able to make requests to the WordPress site.
