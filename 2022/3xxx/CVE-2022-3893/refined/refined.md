- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied HTML when editing custom navigation menu items.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with admin rights can inject arbitrary HTML, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the administrative interface for editing navigation menu items.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative privileges to edit custom navigation menus.
