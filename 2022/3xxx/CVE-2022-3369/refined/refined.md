- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of registry symbolic links. The `bdservicehost.exe` component in Bitdefender Engines doesn't properly validate registry symbolic links.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Access Control. An attacker can manipulate registry symlinks to point to privileged registry keys.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete privileged registry keys, leading to a loss of system integrity and potentially causing system instability or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attack vector, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create registry symbolic links, which typically requires user interaction or elevated privileges. However, the vulnerability description states that no privileges are needed, but user interaction is required which indicates the attacker would need to trick a user.
