- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin suffers from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin allows an attacker to change the password of arbitrary users, not just their own. This is due to a lack of proper access control when updating user profiles.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the password of any user, including administrator accounts, potentially leading to full account takeover and site compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=update_user_profile` parameter. The request includes a `user[ID]` parameter specifying the target user's ID, along with new password values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user (Subscriber+) of the WordPress site. They do not need any special privileges other than being a basic user.
