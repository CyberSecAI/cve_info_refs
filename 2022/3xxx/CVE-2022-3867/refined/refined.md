Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly verify the validity of ACL tokens with TTLs when used to subscribe to Nomad's event stream. Specifically, after the TTL of an ACL token expired, the token was not re-verified and the stream continued to send events to the subscriber until the token was garbage collected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The vulnerability lies in the lack of continuous authorization checks for ACL tokens with a TTL when used to subscribe to the event stream.
-  Nomad's ACL token TTL verification logic was not applied to each event being sent down the stream.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor or third party with authenticated access and an ACL token with a TTL can potentially continue to receive event updates beyond their authorized time frame, up until garbage collection of the token. This could lead to unauthorized monitoring of state changes in Nomad's FSM.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An authenticated user obtains an ACL token with a TTL
-  The user uses the token to subscribe to Nomad's event stream.
-  After the token's TTL expires, the user continues to receive events, exceeding the authorized access window.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to Nomad with the ability to obtain an ACL token with an expiry TTL.
- Ability to subscribe to Nomad's event stream.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves modifying Nomad's ACL token TTL verification logic to authorize the subscriber's ACL token before sending each event down the stream, enforcing the TTL.
- The issue was found during internal testing by the Nomad engineering team.
- The affected versions are Nomad and Nomad Enterprise 1.4.0 up to 1.4.1; fixed in 1.4.2.
