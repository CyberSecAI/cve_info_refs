- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the MAC address filter implementation prevents it from being active after a device reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The MAC address filtering mechanism fails to be re-enabled after a reboot. This constitutes an "Expected Behavior Violation" (CWE-440).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can bypass the MAC address filtering, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the network the filter was intended to protect.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely over the network. Specifically, it involves triggering a device reboot.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to communicate with the device over the network and cause it to reboot. After reboot, they can circumvent the MAC filtering.
