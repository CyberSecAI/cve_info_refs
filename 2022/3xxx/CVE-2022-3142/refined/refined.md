Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-3142:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper use of prepared statements in the `print_chart` function of the `includes/classes/class.dashboard.php` file within the NEX Forms WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `form_id` variable is concatenated directly into the SQL query string after calling `prepare` instead of being passed as a parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The direct concatenation of the `form_id` variable into the SQL query allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. Although WordPress escapes single quotes, double quotes and backslashes, it does not prevent SQL injection via whitespace. The `form_id` variable is expected to be an integer, but no validation or sanitization is done to prevent inserting characters such as a space which allow for arbitrary code injection.
*   **Incorrect Prepared Statement Usage:**  The use of `prepare` is not effective here, making the application vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data stored in the database could be exposed.
*   **Full System Access:** The attacker could potentially use the SQL injection to gain full access to the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `form_id` parameter in the HTTP GET request sent to the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nex-forms-dashboard` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the `NF_USER_LEVEL` capability (by default, an administrator). The user does not need to have purchased the pro version of NEX Forms.

**Technical Details:**
*   The `print_chart` function is called when the user visits the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nex-forms-dashboard` page.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is within the `print_chart` function located in `includes/classes/class.dashboard.php`.
*   The vulnerable SQL query is constructed similar to this: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE form_id = <form_id_variable>`. The `<form_id_variable>` is concatenated without proper sanitization.
*   The attacker can inject SQL by adding a space and then the injection payload after the integer. e.g. `&form_id=1 AND (SELECT 42 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))b)--`.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like `sqlmap`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection, because the vulnerable page may not show any output unless a pro version of the plugin is purchased.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.9.7 of the NEX Forms plugin.
*   The proof of concept is provided as: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nex-forms-dashboard&form_id=1%20AND%20(SELECT%2042%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))b)--`
