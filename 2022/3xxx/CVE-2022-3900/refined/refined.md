Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `cooked-pro` WordPress plugin fails to properly validate or sanitize the `recipe_args` parameter before unserializing it. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious PHP objects.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary PHP objects through the `recipe_args` parameter, which is then unserialized without proper validation.
    *   **Insecure Deserialization:** The plugin uses the `unserialize()` function on user-provided data without proper safeguards, making it vulnerable to object injection.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including, but not limited to, arbitrary code execution on the server. The specific impact depends on the classes and methods available within the application and the injected object.
    *   The CVSS score of 7.4 (High) indicates a significant potential impact.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is conducted via an HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`, targeting the `cooked_loadmore` action.
    *   **`recipe_args` Parameter:** The malicious serialized PHP object is passed through the `recipe_args` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They can send the crafted request from any location accessible to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable plugin, its affected version, and the specific parameter to target. They also need to be able to create a malicious PHP object for injection.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-502, which is related to insecure deserialization.
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Marcin Motwicki.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.5.7 of the Cooked Pro plugin.
