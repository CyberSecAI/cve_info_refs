The provided content describes a vulnerability in the WPQA WordPress plugin, which is a companion plugin used with the Discy and Himer themes. This content is relevant to CVE-2022-3343.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin incorrectly validates that a user already follows another in the `wpqa_following_you_ajax` action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing validation allows a user to inflate their score on the site by repeatedly triggering the "follow" action.
- The vulnerability is classified as an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and is related to broken access control.
- The plugin fails to properly verify if the follow action is legitimate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate their score on the site by repeatedly triggering the follow action from another user.
- This can lead to a user gaining an unfair advantage or reputation within the platform.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed through a crafted POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- An attacker can submit a form with a hidden input for the `wpqa_following_you` action and the target user's ID, thereby simulating a follow action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to know the user ID of the target user they want to reward.
- For versions prior to 5.9.1, no nonce was required.  For 5.9.1 and later, a valid nonce would be required, but it can be obtained if the user has a valid account on the site.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is in the `wpqa_following_you_ajax` action of the plugin.
- The vulnerability affects WPQA versions less than 5.9.3, Discy theme versions less than 5.5.3 and Himer theme versions less than 1.9.3.
- The vulnerability is fixed in WPQA 5.9.3, Discy 5.5.3, and Himer 1.9.3.
