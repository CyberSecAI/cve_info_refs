- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Advanced Comment Form plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a malicious script within the plugin settings, a high privilege user like an admin can trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a user with high privileges such as admin to inject the malicious script into the plugin's settings.
