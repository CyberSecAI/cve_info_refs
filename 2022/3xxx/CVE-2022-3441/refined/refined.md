- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically within the "Cor de fundo" text field under the Popup tab.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the plugin settings page or other parts of the WordPress admin panel where the injected code is rendered. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The XSS can be executed even when unfiltered\_html is disabled.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's settings interface. An attacker needs to navigate to the plugin's settings, specifically the "Popup" tab and then the "Cor de fundo" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges within the WordPress installation.
