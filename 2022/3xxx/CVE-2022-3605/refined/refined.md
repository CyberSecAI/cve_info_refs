Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-3605:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin "WP CSV Exporter" does not properly sanitize or escape fields when exporting data to a CSV file. This allows for the injection of malicious formulas.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSV Injection: Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data before it is included in a CSV file. This allows the injection of spreadsheet formulas, which may be automatically executed when the file is opened in a spreadsheet application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user opens the exported CSV file using spreadsheet software like Excel or LibreOffice, injected formulas will be executed. This may lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or other malicious activities, depending on the user's spreadsheet application and its settings.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the export of post data as a CSV file, specifically through user-controlled input in the post title.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify content (e.g., a post title) in the WordPress instance, inserting a formula to be executed when the CSV is exported and opened.
- The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role to create posts.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the "WP CSV Exporter" plugin prior to 1.3.7.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 3.4 (low), indicating its severity.
- This vulnerability is related to CWE-1236, which is "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File."
