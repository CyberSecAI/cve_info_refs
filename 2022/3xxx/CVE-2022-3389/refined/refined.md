Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue. It arises from improper handling of file paths when serving static files. Specifically, the application was not adequately validating the requested paths, allowing an attacker to potentially access files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the file paths used in the `staticfile` handler.  An attacker could manipulate the path (e.g. by using `..` sequences) to access sensitive files outside the designated static directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Access:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that the application user has access to. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or other system data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the `staticfile` handler, where the attacker crafts a malicious path within the URL (e.g. `/static//../../test.txt`) .

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker requires network access to the rdiffweb server to send HTTP requests. No specific authentication is required to trigger this specific path traversal vulnerability since the vulnerable handler has `@cherrypy.tools.auth_form(on=False)` decorator.

**Technical Details (extracted from the code diff):**
- **Vulnerable Code:**
    - The original `staticfile` handler in `rdiffweb/controller/dispatch.py` is vulnerable:
      ```python
        def staticfile(path):
            ...
            @cherrypy.expose
            @cherrypy.tools.auth_form(on=False)
            @cherrypy.tools.sessions(on=False)
            @cherrypy.tools.secure_headers(on=False)
            @cherrypy.tools.staticfile(filename=path)
            def handler(*args, **kwargs):
                if cherrypy.request.method not in ('GET', 'HEAD'):
                    return None
                filename = os.path.join(path, *args)
                assert filename.startswith(path)
                if not os.path.isfile(filename):
                    return None
                return serve_file(filename, content_type)
            return handler
      ```
      It tries to validate the path with `assert filename.startswith(path)` but this is easily bypassed using `..` sequences. It also checks if the file exists `if not os.path.isfile(filename)`, this does not prevent reading the content of existing files outside the static directory.
- **Fix:**
    - The fix involves removing the direct call to `os.path.join` and using cherrypy's `staticfile` tool to handle file serving, this tool likely has its own path sanitization logic.
      ```python
        def staticfile(path):
            ...
            @cherrypy.expose
            @cherrypy.tools.auth_form(on=False)
            @cherrypy.tools.sessions(on=False)
            @cherrypy.tools.secure_headers(on=False)
            @cherrypy.tools.staticfile(filename=path)
            def handler(*args, **kwargs):
                if cherrypy.request.method not in ('GET', 'HEAD'):
                   return None
                return None
      ```
- **Test Case:**
  - A test case was added (`test_path_traversal`) in `rdiffweb/controller/tests/test_controller.py` to check the fix.
  ```python
        def test_path_traversal(self):
            self.getPage('/static//../../test.txt')
            self.assertStatus(403)
  ```

**Additional Notes:**

-   The commit message "Mitigate path traversal vulnerability #227" and the changelog entry explicitly mention CVE-2022-3389.
-   The provided diff includes changes in `README.md`, `rdiffweb/controller/dispatch.py`, `rdiffweb/controller/tests/test_controller.py` and `rdiffweb/rdw_app.py`, indicating the vulnerability was in the static file serving mechanism and the fix involved modifications to the affected files.
