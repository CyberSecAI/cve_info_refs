## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Broken Link Checker < 1.11.20 - Admin+ Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Youtube API Key settings and save: test"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>.
The XSS will be triggered when viewing the settings page again

### Affects Plugins
