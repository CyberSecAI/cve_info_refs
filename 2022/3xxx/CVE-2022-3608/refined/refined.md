Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the changes related to the mentioned CVE:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit introduces a verification mechanism for backup files in phpMyFAQ. The vulnerability likely stems from the absence of this verification in previous versions, which could potentially allow malicious actors to inject harmful data into backup files, which could then be used to compromise the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Backup File Verification:** Prior to this commit, there was no validation of backup files during the import process. This would have allowed an attacker to upload malicious backups, potentially containing modified data or even executable code, leading to various security breaches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify the backed-up data (e.g., FAQ content, user information, configuration settings) and then restore it, leading to various forms of data manipulation and potentially compromising the integrity of the application and the data it hosts.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A carefully crafted backup file could potentially contain malicious code that could be executed upon import, leading to complete compromise of the application server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Backup File Upload:** The primary attack vector involves uploading a maliciously crafted backup file through the import functionality of phpMyFAQ.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:**  The attacker would likely need administrative access or credentials to access the backup import functionality in phpMyFAQ.
- **Ability to craft a malicious backup file:** The attacker also has to be able to craft a backup file that can exploit the lack of verification.

**Additional details:**
The commit message mentions "added verification of backup files". The code changes reflect:
-  Changes to `backup.export.php` and `backup.import.php` files.
- Introduction of verification using `SodiumException` for backup files.
- Checks for file encoding and version during backup import.
- Addition of the `phpMyFAQ/Backup.php` file, which contains `verifyBackup` and `createBackup` functions.
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry: "- added verification of backup files (Thorsten)".

This detailed information indicates that the primary goal of this commit was to address the vulnerability caused by the lack of backup file verification. The vulnerability was due to the potential for malicious users to upload crafted SQL dumps. It has been addressed by adding verification to both the backup creation process and the import functionality.
