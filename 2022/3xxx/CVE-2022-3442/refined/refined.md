Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input in the `ebics.aspx` server-side script of the CREALOGIX EBICS server. Specifically, the `Version` parameter within the XML EBICS request is not properly sanitized when included in an error message, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The server reflects the unsanitized `Version` parameter back to the client within the error message.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The server fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `Version` field before including it in the HTML response, which allows arbitrary HTML and JavaScript injection.
- **Verbose Error Messages:** The server exposes detailed error messages that include the unsanitized user-provided data, which enables the exploitation of the XSS.
- **Incorrect Content-Type Header:** The server responds with `text/html` content type when an error occurs, which makes the reflected XSS exploitable within a browser environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of the vulnerable EBICS server.
- The attacker could potentially perform actions such as stealing user session information, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing other unauthorized actions.
- The article highlights that the impact is potentially elevated if the EBICS subdomain is also used by other web applications or if the vulnerable XSS is exploitable via an EBICS client. This includes possibilities for exploiting the EBICS client if implemented as a web application or by using IPC mechanisms.
- If the deployment is not on a separate EBICS subdomain, the domain might be in use for other web applications, thereby affecting other web applications origins.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is via HTTP requests to the EBICS server's `ebics.aspx` endpoint.
- **Reflected Attack:** The XSS payload is included within an EBICS request, which is reflected back to the client in the server's response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious EBICS requests that include a malicious payload in the `Version` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user to visit a malicious website which submits a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs the victim to use a browser to send the malicious request or to open a response with the malicious content.

**Additional Details:**

- The article provides examples of specific XSS payloads that bypass WAF rules, including a payload that executes `print(1)` and a more complex payload capable of executing arbitrary javascript using the URLs hash part.
- It also includes a complete HTML example to demonstrate how the attack can be launched from a malicious website using a crafted form submission.
- The vulnerability exists in the ebics.aspx script and doesn't affect the ebicsweb script.
- The advisory mentions that the issue was fixed in version 7.1 of the Crealogix software.
