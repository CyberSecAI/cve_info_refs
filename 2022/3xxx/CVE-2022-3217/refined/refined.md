{
  "CVE-2022-3217": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way VBASE obfuscates login messages when logging in via Web-Remote. It uses XOR with a static initial key.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of static key for obfuscation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker who can capture a login session can obtain the login credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access",
      "Capture of login session traffic"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to capture network traffic between the client and server during login"
     ],
    "details": "The login process is as follows:\n1. Client sends 'LOGINREQUEST' XORed with a static initial key.\n2. Server sends 'LOGINREQUEST$' XORed with the same initial key.\n3. Client decodes the server's message to get a new XOR key.\n4. Client sends 'LOGIN$username$password' XORed with the new key.\n5. Server decodes the client's message to get credentials.\n6. If successful, it returns 'LOGIN_OK$', otherwise 'LOGIN_FAILED'."
