- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a URL before outputting it within an HTML attribute. This occurs when a specific widget ("Capture box | Rock Convert") is present on a page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL. By appending a malicious script to the URL, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when a user visits the page containing the vulnerable widget. For example: `https://example.com/?"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious javascript payload and entice the user to click on the link to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
