## Description

![@enj](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7001223?u=7723cbf95d18de87098abaa1a99a43cbfc31f69c&v=4&size=48)[enj](https://github.com/enj)opened [on Sep 16, 2022](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112513#issue-1375935782)

CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L) (5.1, medium)

A security issue was discovered in kube-apiserver that allows an aggregated API server to redirect client traffic to any URL. This could lead to the client performing unexpected actions as well as forwarding the client's API server credentials to third parties.

This issue has been rated medium and assigned CVE-2022-3172

### Am I vulnerable?

All Kubernetes clusters with the following versions that are running aggregated API servers are impacted. To identify if you have aggregated API servers configured, run the following command:

```
kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io -o=jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.spec.service)]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'
```
#### Affected Versions

* kube-apiserver v1.25.0
* kube-apiserver v1.24.0 - v1.24.4
* kube-apiserver v1.23.0 - v1.23.10
* kube-apiserver v1.22.0 - v1.22.13
* kube-apiserver <= v1.21.14

### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

Aside from upgrading, no direct mitigation is available.

Aggregated API servers are a trusted part of the Kubernetes control plane, and configuring them is a privileged administrative operation. Ensure that only trusted cluster administrators are allowed to create or modify `APIService` configuration, and follow security best practices with any aggregated API servers that may be in use.

#### Fixed Versions

* kube-apiserver v1.25.1 - fixed by [Automated cherry pick of #112193: Add an option for aggregator #112330](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112330)
* kube-apiserver v1.24.5 - fixed by [Automated cherry pick of #112193: Add an option for aggregator #112331](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112331)
* kube-apiserver v1.23.11 - fixed by [Automated cherry pick of #112193: Add an option for aggregator #112358](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112358)
* kube-apiserver v1.22.14 - fixed by [Automated cherry pick of #112193: Add an option for aggregator #112359](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112359)

**Fix impact:** The fix blocks all 3XX responses from aggregated API servers by default. This may disrupt an aggregated API server that relies on redirects as part of its normal function. If all current and future aggregated API servers are considered trustworthy and redirect functionality is required, set the `--aggregator-reject-forwarding-redirect` Kubernetes API server flag to `false` to restore the previous behavior.

To upgrade, refer to the documentation: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-upgrade>

### Detection

Kubernetes audit log events indicate the HTTP status code sent to the client via the `responseStatus.code` field. This can be used to detect if an aggregated API server is redirecting clients.

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io
