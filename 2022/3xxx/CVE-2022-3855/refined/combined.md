## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# 404 to Start <= 1.6.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. In the settings of the plugin, enter the following value in all the input boxes. The value is: 1" onmouseenter="alert(/XSS/)".
2. Click the 'Save Changes' button on the page.
3. Refresh or re-enter the page and move the mouse over the input box to get the XSS trigger.
