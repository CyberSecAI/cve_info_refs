The provided content describes two SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `go-ibax` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from the use of `fmt.Sprintf` to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization of user-supplied inputs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly embeds user-provided data into SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the `table_name` and `order` parameters are concatenated directly into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) uses `pg_sleep(3)` to demonstrate the ability to inject and execute arbitrary SQL. A successful attack could lead to data exfiltration, data modification, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending HTTP POST requests to the `/api/v2/open/tablesInfo` and `/api/v2/open/columnsInfo` endpoints.
- The vulnerable parameters are `table_name` and `order` within the request's data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints with malicious payloads.
- No specific position or authentication is needed since the endpoints are `/open/` and are likely intended for public access.
