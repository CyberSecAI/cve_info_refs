- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a use-after-free that occurs in the `btf_dump_name_dups` function. The function stores a string address as a key in a hash table (`name_map`). The memory for this string is allocated using `realloc()`. When the memory is resized later by `realloc()`, the old memory might be freed, causing the address in `name_map` to become a dangling pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. This occurs because the hashmap is storing pointers to memory that can be freed/reallocated elsewhere.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to a crash due to accessing freed memory, which may have security implications if the crash can be triggered by external input.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered through the BTF dumping functionality. Specifically, when adding duplicate strings using `btf_dump_name_dups` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to use the BTF dumping functionality and be able to trigger the conditions where duplicate strings are added, causing memory re-allocation and subsequent use-after-free in hashmap.

The provided patch fixes the issue by storing a copy of the duplicated string's address in the hashmap. Additionally, the patch adds a new function `btf_dump_free_names` to free allocated memory.
