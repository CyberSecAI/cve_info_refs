- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Popup Maker plugin does not sanitize and escape certain popup options, specifically the cookie name field when creating a new trigger.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Contributor role (or higher) can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when an administrator edits the popup trigger. This can lead to various malicious actions including but not limited to session hijacking, admin account compromise, or further attacks against other users.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is exploited by creating a new popup, adding a trigger, and injecting the XSS payload into the "cookie name" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site.
