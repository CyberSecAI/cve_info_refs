The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the "Simple Cold Storage Management System v1.0".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user input before storing it in the database and displaying it back to the user. Specifically, the "Name" parameter when adding new storage is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input, leading to the injection of malicious scripts into the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of other users who access the application.
- This can be used to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the application, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious payload through the "Name" field when adding new storage via the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with sufficient privileges to add new storage.
- The attacker requires network access to the application.
