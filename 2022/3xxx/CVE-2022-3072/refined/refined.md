Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE-2022-3072:**
The provided content is related to a fix for a stored XSS vulnerability, however, without the CVE description, it is difficult to determine with certainty if it relates to CVE-2022-3072. The commit message and code changes suggest that this is a security fix.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the allowance of unsanitized SVG files to be uploaded, which can lead to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: The application allowed users to upload SVG files without sanitizing them, which means that if a malicious SVG file is uploaded, it can execute arbitrary JavaScript code when viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as:
   - Stealing user session cookies
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Defacing the website
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user
   - Data exfiltration

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted SVG file to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to upload files to the application. The specific permissions needed to upload files are not clear from the information provided.
- No specific user-level privileges are mentioned, but it is assumed the attacker requires permissions to upload files within the application.

**Additional Information:**
- The commit message explicitly mentions that the fix is for a stored XSS vulnerability related to SVG files in "FileUpload.fnc.php".
- The code diff shows that the `.svg` extension has been removed from the allowed file extensions list in `FileUpload.fnc.php`. This means that SVG files are no longer permitted.
- The CHANGES.md file confirms this fix and provides credit to @scgajge12 and @crowdoverflow.
