| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2128923#c0)  Terry Wilson    2022-09-22 01:26:47 UTC  ``` Description of problem: After the fix for [bz2123014](show_bug.cgi?id=2123014 "CLOSED ERRATA - Unable to complete OVSDB transaction due to timeout on the TRY_AGAIN retries") merged, occasionally neutron could enter a loop continually retrying transactions and flooding logs with messages like:  OVSDB transaction returned TRY_AGAIN, retrying do_commit /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ovsdbapp/backend/ovs_idl/transaction.py:107   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  17.0.0  How reproducible: Variable in the real world, 100% in the lab  Steps to reproduce: 1) start neutron w/ debug=True and allow to complete loading/downloading ovn db data 2) iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 6641 -j DROP 3) openstack network create test1  Actual Results: Lots of very fast TRY_AGAIN log messages  Expected results: A single (or very few) TRY_AGAIN message and upon removing the blocking iptables rule the transaction should proceed (providing connectivity is restored before the ovsdb_connection_timeout)  The issue is that the wait_for_change() method that ovsdbapp calls is actually being monkeypatched by neutron code and the version in the neutron codebase has an indentation error which makes the method a NoOp.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2128923#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-01-25 12:30:26 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory (Moderate: Red Hat OpenStack Platform 17.0 (openstack-neutron) security update), and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.

This happens before some workers, such as maintenance, are spawned.  This requires connection to the Northbound database that partially downloads DB content. It may take a fair amount of time to download the data which may slow down lots of things.

This patch is in the code since U/S version Queens (OSP13). This check has been replicated to other Network commands too.  This is the output when the related command is executed (using a OSP16.2 deployment):   $ openstack security group list --project None   No project with a name or ID of 'None' exists.   When an admin user calls the CLI script checks the existence of the project "None" before sending the command to the Neutron server. If the project does not exists, the CLI returns this error message.  If the user is a regular user and the project does not exist or can't be seen from this user, the CLI does not return anything (to avoid providing information to a unauthorized user):   $ openstack security group list --project <non_existing_project>   (empty line)   $ openstack security group list --project <admin_project>   (empty line)   Can you check when this is happening and what version are you using?

# Neutron should not create security group with project==None

Bug #1988026 reported by

on 2022-08-29

### Bug Description

When a non-admin user tries to list security groups for project\_id "None", Neutron creates a default security group for that project and returns an empty list to the caller.

To reproduce:

openstack --os-cloud devstack security group list --project None

openstack --os-cloud devstack-admin security group list

The API call that is made is essentially

GET /networking/v2.0/security-groups?project\_id=None

The expected result would be an authorization failure, since normal users should not be allowed to list security groups for other projects.

Note that the opensearch link only shows the failures that occur when two tasks try to delete that same security group in parallel. This used to succeed earlier (most of the time?), but is failing most of the time since a couple of days. The issue in this bug seems to have been existing for quite some time and is not directly related.

See [https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tempest/+/854973](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tempest/%2B/854973) for a patch that will prevent Tempest from triggering the issue, but a proper fix in Neutron would still be warranted IMO.

It's actually worse that just the None case Jens mentioned, I can use any random string and create a default security group for it as 'None' is what is actually being used for the project ID, not the python None.

And I verified that quotas will not catch this, I was able to create default SGs for more than 10 "project IDs" successfully.

I started looking at the code but it's end-of-day here so will look further tomorrow.

But I'll change this to Critical to get some eyes on it.

After a brief discussion with Brian Haley, it seems like this represents a minor to moderate security risk: an authenticated user can create an unbounded number of empty security groups because they're not limited by the project quota (since these are not created for their project). I'm adding an incomplete security advisory task for now to indicate that the VMT is following this, and subscribing the neutron-coresec team for added visibility. When a fix is devised, if it's a backportable solution, we can further discuss whether this is severe enough to warrant broad distribution of an advisory statement as well.

Oh, nice. This even works when supplying valid project IDs of different projects. The result isn't different though then what would happen when the project does their own initial contact with Neutron, so I think there is no additional exploit hidden there.

Note however that in the default configuration, the created security groups will not be empty, but contain four rules (allow outgoing and remote=self for both IPv4 and IPv6), that will slightly increase the resource usage impact.

So far I agree with a moderate impact assessment. Here is a recap as I understand the situation:

Any non-admin user can cause new security group to be created by listing the security groups of an invalid project\_id. This new security group includes 4 default rules which will consume memory and CPU cycles. This action can be repeated an ulimited number of times as there is no quota limit, which could eventually cause a denial of service.

Would it be appropriate for Red Hat to assign this a CVE?

Nick: From a project standpoint, we can't prevent anyone from assigning a CVE to any particular bug, but take no position on whether someone should. All we ask is that you let us know (by updating this bug report) what CVE number gets assigned so that if we or someone else later decide it needs a CVE we don't end up with duplicate assignments. The main question to the project is whether this warrants a broadly circulated advisory. Resource consumption bugs only reachable by authenticated users tend to straddle the line on practical exploit vs security hardening opportunity.

If there are other known ways for authenticated users to create resources which can fill up databases as quickly (regardless of whether they would "get billed" for them: someone who is malicious enough to do this likely has no intent of paying a bill anyway), then publishing an advisory would send a misleading signal that we don't expect authenticated users to be able to consume resources. The speed at which they can fill a reasonable sized database in a production deployment and whether or not this activity is likely to be detected by typically employed API rate limiters or resource monitoring systems also informs the decision on whether this rises to the level of a security advisory.

Neutron maintainers: What's your take on these factors?

As mentioned earlier, the number of Neutron resources a user/project can create is usually stricly limited by quotas, the default limit is 10 security groups and 100 rules in them [0]. Because of this, it is also unlikely that deployments use additional resource monitoring systems for this, since they can expect the quotas to be respected.

Also, since the trigger is just a GET query, not a PUT/POST, creating an empty response, I'd assume API rate limiters to also usually not be too strict about this, if they are at all.

Lastly, the main DoS vector likely is not the database size itself filling up, but performance issues in the lookup of security groups and rules, though I have no idea how fast this would happen and how severe the impact might be. Maybe some testing on this might be needed. But I would consider a plausible result could be that other rules fail to get applied in the expected way.

All in all I think that an advisory could be warranted, but would also be very interested to hear other Neutron maintainers' opinions.

I have reserved CVE-2022-3277. Sounds like some exploratory testing is needed to get a better handle on impact.

Since I'm the Neutron maintainer that triaged and fixed this I'm a little biased, but will just repeat some of the above for clarity:

1. You must be an authenticated user of the cloud to make the request

2. This is a GET request that in essence has the effect of a POST because it creates a resource

3. The resource created does not affect the quota of the user making the request

4. The DoS vector is going to consume API and DB resources, albeit a "small" amount

5. There is no action taken by the system - no agent will be triggered to instantiate the fake

   security groups

I think if #5 was true it would warrant more cause for alarm, since something like the OVS agent doing a SG recalculation could consume more CPU resources.

The severity of the bug (critical) was more an indication fixing it should be prioritized over other bugs for the week, especially once I realized it got around the quota limit.

So IMHO it's at most a security advisory, but am open to other maintainer's opinions.

Following Brian's post 2 years ago, there didn't seem to be any appetite for issuing an OSSA on this due to the low risk of exploitation and limited impact (even though it did eventually get fixed and backported in the ensuing months). As such, I'm closing the Security Advisory task as Won't Fix, but if there are any dissenting opinions I'm happy to reopen and revisit that decision.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2023%3A0275)

## Topic

An update for openstack-neutron is now available for Red Hat OpenStack
Platform 17.0 (Wallaby).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a virtual network service for OpenStack.
Just as OpenStack Compute (nova) provides an API to dynamically request and
configure virtual servers, OpenStack Networking provides an API to
dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks connect
'interfaces' from other OpenStack services (e.g. virtual NICs from Compute
VMs). The OpenStack Networking API supports extensions to provide advanced
network capabilities (e.g. QoS, ACLs, network monitoring, etc.)

Security Fix(es):

* unrestricted creation of security groups (CVE-2022-3277)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE
page listed in the References section.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2022%3A8855)

## Topic

An update for openstack-neutron is now available for Red Hat OpenStack
Platform 16.2.4 (Train) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.4.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a virtual network service for OpenStack.
Just as OpenStack Compute (nova) provides an API to dynamically request and
configure virtual servers, OpenStack Networking provides an API to
dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks connect
'interfaces' from other OpenStack services (e.g. virtual NICs from Compute
VMs). The OpenStack Networking API supports extensions to provide advanced
network capabilities (e.g. QoS, ACLs, network monitoring, etc.)

Security Fix(es):

* unrestricted creation of security groups (CVE-2022-3277)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2022%3A8870)

## Topic

An update for openstack-neutron is now available for Red Hat OpenStack
Platform 16.1.9 (Train) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a virtual network service for OpenStack.
Just as OpenStack Compute (nova) provides an API to dynamically request and
configure virtual servers, OpenStack Networking provides an API to
dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks connect
'interfaces' from other OpenStack services (e.g. virtual NICs from Compute
VMs). The OpenStack Networking API supports extensions to provide advanced
network capabilities (e.g. QoS, ACLs, network monitoring, etc.)

Security Fix(es):

* unrestricted creation of security groups (CVE-2022-3277)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE
page listed in the References section.

## Solution

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2107602#c0)  Andreas Karis    2022-07-15 13:58:28 UTC  ``` Description of problem: neutron revision_number does not bump on network update  neutron revision_number does not bump on network update  I tested the exact same mechanism with the subnet resource and an update to the same field (description) and it works like a charm. For the network resource, the revision number is not updated when updating the description field, instead there's an inconsitency checker which fixesthe inconsistency from time to time  Please see [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1981817](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1981817) for full details   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): [stack@standalone gophercloud-test]$ sudo podman ps | grep neutron c0f71c87753a  registry-proxy.engineering.redhat.com/rh-osbs/rhosp16-openstack-neutron-server-ovn:16.2_20220609.1          kolla_start           4 days ago    Up 4 days ago            neutron_api 8002f415d5c4  registry-proxy.engineering.redhat.com/rh-osbs/rhosp16-openstack-neutron-metadata-agent-ovn:16.2_20220609.1  kolla_start           4 days ago    Up 4 days ago            ovn_metadata_agent 0bc5974e8fb8  registry-proxy.engineering.redhat.com/rh-osbs/rhosp16-openstack-neutron-metadata-agent-ovn:16.2_20220609.1  /bin/bash -c HAPR...  4 days ago    Up 4 days ago            neutron-haproxy-ovnmeta-b9cfe6b5-831b-419c-bc25-49ba01a33c84 578bb7cab9d2  registry-proxy.engineering.redhat.com/rh-osbs/rhosp16-openstack-neutron-metadata-agent-ovn:16.2_20220609.1  /bin/bash -c HAPR...  38 hours ago  Up 38 hours ago          neutron-haproxy-ovnmeta-ed889e25-f8fa-4684-a9c4-54fff8de37b8   How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.  Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2107602#c1)  Miguel Lavalle    2022-07-18 14:01:33 UTC  ``` Next step is to analyze how subnets updates also require an update in the network. If that is confirmed, this bz is not a bug and can be closed along with the corresponding U/S Launchpad bug   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2107602#c2)  Slawek Kaplonski    2022-07-28 10:34:56 UTC  ``` I checked in in the neutron code. Subnet's revision is bumped "on puprose". It was done with commit <https://github.com/openstack/neutron/commit/5264ab966d3db7b1cb698190872cbe6feaf48464> to fix bug [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1532695](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1532695) - if we would like to get rid of this network's revision_number bump when subnet is created we would need to solve that bug in some other way which may not be trivial. Later it was also optimized with <https://github.com/openstack/neutron/commit/bc306a5512dc7d46737f1822cd2f827f87b95f9c> but general idea is still the same.  Now, for other resources, I found out that commit <https://github.com/openstack/neutron/commit/e9a7ed8c63ec5bb0fdca3406c8b21071729dd09d> introduced something similar for ports - when port was created or deleted, network's revision number was bumped too. But this was reverted with commit [https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/+/591847](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/%2B/591847) to fix bug [https://bugs.launchpad.net/kuryr-libnetwork/+bug/1787028](https://bugs.launchpad.net/kuryr-libnetwork/%2Bbug/1787028)  So we have 2 possibilities to make all that behaviour consistent across all resources: 1. Stop bumping network's revision number when subnet is created - but that will require to solve [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1532695](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1532695) in different way first, 2. Keep current "subnet and network" behaviour like it is now, identify all other relationships and implement revision bumps for all of them - this can be even harder to do then proposal 1. and may have some unpredictable side effects e.g. for the ovn mechanism driver which relies on revision numbers a lot.  So regarding all of that what I wrote above and giving that this is low priority and severity bug I'm going to close it as "WONTFIX".   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2107602#c4)  Andreas Karis    2022-07-28 11:08:07 UTC  ``` Thanks for the analysis Slawek. I think there's a misunderstanding here: I found a bug where the revision number does not increase at all on the network resource, even though I change the network's description field.  Check the upstream bug for a reproducer instruction. It didn't happen to me all of the time, but during that specific test that I posted upstream, the following series would lead to the same revision number:  $ openstack net create net0 -f value -c revision_number 1 $ openstack net set net0 --description foo $ openstack net show net0 -f value -c revision_number    # revision number stays the same   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2107602#c5)  Andreas Karis    2022-07-28 11:09:52 UTC  ``` Omg, bad typo, sorry for that.  In the description field, it should have been: "I tested the exact same mechanism with the subnet resource and an update to the same field (description) and it works like a charm. For the network resource, the revision number is not updated when updating the field, instead there's an inconsitency checker which fixes the inconsistency from time to time"   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2107602#c6)  Andreas Karis    2022-07-28 11:13:44 UTC  ``` Also just further clarifition: I found this issue with RHOSP 16.2, see the first comment for the container versions.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2107602#c7)  Slawek Kaplonski    2022-08-01 11:10:08 UTC  ``` Thx Andreas for explanation. I took another look at it and it seems that it's the same issue like reported in [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1865173](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1865173) for router object. I proposed patch [https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/+/851733](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/%2B/851733) which should fix both of those issues together.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=2107602#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-07 19:27:22 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory (Moderate: Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.2.4 (openstack-neutron) security update), and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.
