- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL query via a REST endpoint accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-json/woo-aliexpress/v1/product-sku` REST endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges. The attacker needs to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
