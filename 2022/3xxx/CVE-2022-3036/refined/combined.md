## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Gettext override translations < 2.0.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a translation and put the following payload in the "Original (translated) text" field: </textarea><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>

### Affects Plugins
