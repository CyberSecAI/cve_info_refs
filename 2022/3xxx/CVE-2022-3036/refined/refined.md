- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "Original (translated) text" field when creating or editing a translation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (like an admin) can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users accessing the WordPress site. This can lead to actions such as unauthorized data access, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by creating or editing a translation and inserting the malicious payload in the "Original (translated) text" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high-level administrative privileges (Admin+) on the WordPress site to access the translation settings. The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, such as in multisite setups.
