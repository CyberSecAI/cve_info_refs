- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugins do not sanitize and escape their settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A high privilege user such as an admin can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the backend (in the Testimonial list and when editing the related testimonial) and in page/posts where the shortcode is embedded. This can lead to arbitrary actions performed in the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can inject the malicious script via the "Position" or "Testimonial Text" fields when creating a new testimonial.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g. admin) with the ability to create testimonials.
