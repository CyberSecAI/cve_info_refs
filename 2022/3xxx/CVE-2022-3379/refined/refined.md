Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-3379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied data when processing a specially crafted FNT file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787):**  The software fails to properly validate the input data, allowing an attacker to write outside the allocated memory buffer. This vulnerability can be triggered by opening a maliciously crafted FNT file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. The attacker needs to have the victim open a malicious FNT file using the vulnerable Cscape software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to deliver a malicious FNT file to a user of the vulnerable software and trick them into opening it.  This suggests that the attack is not remote and requires user interaction. The CVSS vector string ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)) confirms this: Local access (AV:L), low complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N) but user interaction is required (UI:R).

**Additional Details:**

- The affected product is Horner Automation's Cscape software (versions 9.90 SP 6 and prior, and version 9.90 SP7 for this specific vulnerability).
- The vulnerability is present in how the software handles user-supplied data, specifically related to the handling of FNT files.
- The provided content also lists two other related vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-3378 and CVE-2022-3377, which are also triggered by maliciously crafted FNT files.
- The recommended mitigation is to update Cscape to version 9.90 SP8.
