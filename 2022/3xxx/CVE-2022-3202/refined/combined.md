jfs: prevent NULL deref in diFree

```
Add validation check for JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap to prevent a NULL deref
in diFree since diFree uses it without do any validations.
When function jfs_mount calls diMount to initialize fileset inode
allocation map, it can fail and JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap won't be
initialized. Then it calls diFreeSpecial to close fileset inode allocation
map inode and it will flow into jfs_evict_inode. Function jfs_evict_inode
just validates JFS_SBI(inode->i_sb)->ipimap, then calls diFree. diFree use
JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap directly, then it will cause a NULL deref.
