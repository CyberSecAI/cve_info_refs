- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape imported data before using them in SQL statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification or deletion of data, or taking complete control of the application and underlying system.
- **Attack vectors:** By importing a specially crafted CSV file via the plugin's import functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, to exploit the vulnerability. They also need to have the "Import all XML, CSV & TXT into WordPress" plugin installed, as well as the Polylang plugin installed.
