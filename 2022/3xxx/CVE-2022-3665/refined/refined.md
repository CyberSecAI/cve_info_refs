Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a heap buffer overflow in the `avcinfo` tool of the Bento4 library. This occurs due to incorrect size handling when processing AVC (Advanced Video Coding) bitstreams.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how `AP4_BitStream::WriteBytes` and `AP4_DataBuffer` manage allocated memory when writing data.  The `PrintSliceInfo` function is also implicated in one of the overflow occurrences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash of the `avcinfo` tool, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer (ASAN) error reports.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Heap buffer overflows can often be exploited further for arbitrary code execution or other malicious purposes, though this is not directly demonstrated in the provided information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious AVC Bitstream:** The attack vector is a specially crafted AVC bitstream that triggers the overflow when processed by `avcinfo`. The provided "poc" files (`avcinfo_poc1.zip` and `avcinfo_poc2.zip`) contain these malicious inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input to `avcinfo`:** An attacker would need to provide the malicious AVC bitstream as input to the `avcinfo` tool. This could involve the user processing a malicious file or by other means of supplying input to the tool.
- **No privilege is mentioned** as being needed for this.

**Additional Details:**
- **Specific Locations:** The provided ASAN output indicates the following specific locations:
    - `AP4_BitStream::WriteBytes` in `Bento4/Source/C++/Codecs/Ap4BitStream.cpp:133`
    - `PrintSliceInfo` in `Bento4/Source/C++/Apps/AvcInfo/AvcInfo.cpp:84`
    - `main` in `Bento4/Source/C++/Apps/AvcInfo/AvcInfo.cpp:166, 172`
    - `AP4_DataBuffer::ReallocateBuffer` in `Bento4/Source/C++/Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp:210`
    - `AP4_DataBuffer::SetDataSize` in `Bento4/Source/C++/Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp:151`
- **Fuzzing:** The vulnerabilities were discovered through fuzzing with ASAN, which is a memory error detector.
- **Reproducibility:** The provided steps describe how to reproduce the crash using the provided poc files in a specified environment.
- **Multiple Bugs:** There are at least two distinct heap overflow bugs identified within the issue.
- **ASAN Output Interpretation:** The ASAN output details the exact memory location of the overflow, the size of the read that caused the error, and the call stack that lead to the overflow. This is useful for debugging and patching.
