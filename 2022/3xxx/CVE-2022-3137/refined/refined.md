- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TaskBuilder plugin does not properly validate and sanitize file attachments, specifically SVG files, allowing for malicious content to be uploaded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization for file attachments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a malicious SVG file as a task attachment. The XSS payload is activated when a user clicks on the attachment to view it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber, within the WordPress site to upload the malicious file.
