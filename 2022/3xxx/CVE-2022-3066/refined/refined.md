Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2022-3066**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the `Boards::IssuesController` when creating issues for a board list.
- The authorization check is performed on the board's parent project. However, the issue is created using a user-supplied `project_id` parameter, which is not properly validated. This allows an attacker to specify any project ID, bypassing the intended authorization.
-  The supplied `project_id` parameter takes precedence over the project derived from the board, allowing creation of issues in arbitrary projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system relies on user-provided `project_id` without proper authorization or validation, enabling attackers to manipulate resource access.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `project_id` parameter is not validated against the user's access rights or the context of the board.
- **Spam Check Bypass:** Issues created via this method bypass the spam/CAPTCHA check, potentially leading to abuse.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Issue Creation:** Attackers can create issues in any private or public project, regardless of their access level.
- **Information Disclosure:** By iterating through different project IDs, attackers can map project IDs to namespaces and discover the paths of private projects.
- **Spamming:** Attackers can spam arbitrary projects with issues, potentially disrupting project management and operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to the `/boards/BOARD_ID/lists/LIST_ID/issues` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `issue[project_id]` parameter in the request body to point to a target project.
- **CSRF Token & Session Cookie:** The attacker needs a valid CSRF token and session cookie to make the request, which they can obtain from their own GitLab session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs a valid GitLab account.
- **Knowledge of Board ID and List ID:** The attacker needs to know the board and list ID of a board they have access to.
- **CSRF token and session cookie:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid csrf token and a valid session cookie.
