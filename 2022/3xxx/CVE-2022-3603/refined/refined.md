The provided content relates to CVE-2022-3603.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not validate data when outputting it back in a CSV file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
CSV Injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-provided data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The CSV injection can lead to execution of arbitrary code or commands when the exported CSV file is opened with spreadsheet software.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can inject malicious formulas within customer data fields (e.g., first\_name) that are later exported to a CSV file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to place a WooCommerce order, inserting the malicious payload into a customer data field. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any specific privileges. The user must then export the data as a CSV and open the file with spreadsheet software.
