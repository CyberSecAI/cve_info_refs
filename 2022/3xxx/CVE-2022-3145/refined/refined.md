- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An open redirect vulnerability exists in Okta OIDC Middleware prior to version 5.0.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open Redirect (CWE-601). The software redirects a user to a URL that is constructed based on user-controlled input, without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect a user to an arbitrary URL, potentially leading to phishing attacks or the exposure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends a victim a malformed URL containing a target server they control. After the user completes the login process, they are redirected to the attacker-controlled site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL. The attacker does not require any privileges on the system. User interaction is required, meaning a victim has to click on the malicious link.
