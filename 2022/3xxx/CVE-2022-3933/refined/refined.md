The provided content relates to CVE-2022-3933.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Essential Real Estate WordPress plugin fails to sanitize and escape some parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `columns_gap` parameter, allowing for injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to account hijacking, data theft, and other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript in the `columns_gap` parameter of an AJAX request to `admin-ajax.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without requiring any prior authentication to the website. Any user who visits the crafted URL would be affected if they have admin privileges.
