## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SEO Smart Links <= 3.0.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Whitelisted domains for nofollow exclusion" settings of the plugin: </textarea><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>

### Affects Plugins
