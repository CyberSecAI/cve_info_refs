- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then execute in the browsers of other users who access those settings. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the lack of sanitization when saving plugin settings. Specifically, they can input malicious code (in this example, an img tag with an onerror handler) into the "publisher name" field through the admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access or another high privilege role within WordPress to access the plugin settings and inject the malicious script.
