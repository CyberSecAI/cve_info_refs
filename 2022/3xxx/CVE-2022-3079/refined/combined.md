#### Impact

CPX-CEC-C1 and CPX-CMXX allow unauthenticated access to critical webpage functions (e.g. reboot) which may cause a denial of service of the device

#### Solution

**Remediation**

Currently no fix is planned.

Replace **CPX-CEC-C1** with follow-up product **CPX-CEC-C1-V3**.

Replace **CPX-CMXX** with follow up product **CPX-CEC-M1-V3**.

**General recommendations**

As part of a security strategy, Festo recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:

* Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside
* Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
* Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
* Activate and apply user management and password features
* Use encrypted communication links
* Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
* Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions

Festo strongly recommends to minimize and protect network access to connected devices with state of the art techniques and processes.
For a secure operation follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
