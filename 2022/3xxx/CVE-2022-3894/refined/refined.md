- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP OAuth Server" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting a client. Additionally, it doesn't validate if the object to be deleted is indeed a client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - CSRF vulnerability: The plugin does not implement proper checks to ensure that the delete client action is initiated by the user, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
  - Lack of input validation: The plugin doesn't verify if the provided ID corresponds to a valid client object before deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary clients and potentially posts.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated administrator into submitting it (e.g., via a crafted link or website), the attacker can trigger the deletion of arbitrary client and posts without the admin's consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request, requiring the attacker to target authenticated user sessions on the vulnerable website.
