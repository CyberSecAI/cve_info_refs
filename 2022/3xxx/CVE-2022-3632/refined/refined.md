- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF checks in some AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Specifically, the `unlink_auth_code` AJAX action is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions, such as unlinking authorization codes, by tricking them into visiting a malicious page.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing JavaScript that sends a POST request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`). The victim, while logged into the WordPress site, visits this page, and the malicious request is executed in the victimâ€™s session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in user to visit a malicious page or inject the attack code into a site the user visits. The attacker does not need prior access to the target website, but requires a logged-in user to execute the exploit.
