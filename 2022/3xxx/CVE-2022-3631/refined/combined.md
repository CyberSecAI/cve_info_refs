## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# OAuth Client by DigitialPixies <= 1.1.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escapes some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example, in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in any of the plugin's settings (e.g "Name of Service") and save: "> <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>

### Affects Plugins
