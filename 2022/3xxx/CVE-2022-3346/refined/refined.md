      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the go-resolver library not properly validating the owner name of RRSIG RRs during DNSSEC validation.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The library does not verify if the RRSIG record's owner name matches the queried domain, allowing forgeries.",
          "The library does not validate root DNSSEC public keys, allowing an attacker to use a self-signed root key and delegation chain."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can forge DNS responses, causing the library to report successful validation for invalid, attacker-controlled records. This can lead to a compromise in the integrity of DNS resolution, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack is network-based, targeting the DNS resolution process. An attacker can intercept or manipulate DNS traffic.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate DNS responses. This could involve an attacker being able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network path or controlling a malicious DNS server.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to present a valid RRSIG for an attacker-controlled domain in a response for any other domain by skipping the check that verifies if the RRSIG owner name is the same as the domain name requested. This means an attacker can effectively impersonate a valid DNS response. Additionally, the lack of root key validation allows an attacker to present an entirely forged trust chain."
