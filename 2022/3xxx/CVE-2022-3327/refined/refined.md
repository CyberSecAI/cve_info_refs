Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3327:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a lack of explicit session timeout configurations, specifically an idle timeout and an absolute timeout. The original code lacked proper enforcement of session expiration, potentially leading to sessions remaining active for extended periods, even when the user was no longer actively using the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Lack of Idle Session Timeout:**  Without an idle timeout, a user's session could remain active indefinitely as long as the user did not explicitly logout, even if the user is not actively using the application.
-   **Lack of Absolute Session Timeout:** Without an absolute timeout, the user session could remain active indefinitely as long as the user did not explicitly logout, even if the user closed the browser or did not use the application for a long time.
-   **Inadequate Session Management:** The session management did not properly enforce timeouts, and did not provide options for configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session if it remains active for an extended period, especially on a public computer.
-   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the application by leveraging an active session that was not properly terminated due to the lack of timeouts.
-   **Data Exposure:** If a user’s session was hijacked, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker gains access to an active session on the victim’s machine, such as public computer.
-   **Brute-force attacks:** Although rate limiting is in place, an attacker can attempt to brute force user credentials for an extended period of time due to the lack of session timeouts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Access to an Active Session:**  The attacker must be able to gain access to an active session cookie. This could be done through various means, including intercepting network traffic, or physically gaining access to a computer with an active session.
-   **User Impersonation:** The attacker needs to be able to use the stolen cookie to impersonate the user.

**Additional Details:**

-   The commit addresses the vulnerability by introducing new configuration options:
    -   `session-idle-timeout`: Defines the amount of time a session remains active without activity.
    -   `session-absolute-timeout`: Defines the maximum time a session can be active.
    -   `session-persistent-timeout`: Defines the maximum amount of time to remember a device when "remember me" is used.
-   The fix implements changes in `rdiffweb/core/config.py`, `rdiffweb/rdw_app.py`, and `rdiffweb/tools/auth_form.py`. It introduces session timeout parameters and updates the session timeout logic, ensuring that sessions are invalidated after the specified idle or absolute timeout.
-   The fix correctly applies `max-age` and `expires` properties to the cookie for persistent sessions.
