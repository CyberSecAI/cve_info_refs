- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cloudflare WARP mobile client on iOS allowed users to delete the VPN profile, even when the "Lock WARP switch" feature was enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient protection of the VPN profile from deletion, bypassing the intended restriction of the "Lock WARP switch" feature.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation allows users to bypass policies and restrictions enforced by the Zero Trust platform for enrolled devices. This results in loss of control and monitoring of devices managed by Zero Trust.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the user interface of the Cloudflare WARP mobile client on iOS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the WARP client on an iOS device enrolled in a Zero Trust platform with the "Lock WARP switch" enabled. They also need to have the ability to interact with the mobile device to delete the VPN profile.
