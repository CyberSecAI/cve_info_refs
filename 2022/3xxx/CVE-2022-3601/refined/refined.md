- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** High-privilege users, like admins, can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions. This can occur even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code through the plugin's settings. This payload is then stored and executed when a user visits a page containing the shortcode generated for the malicious setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges within the WordPress site.
