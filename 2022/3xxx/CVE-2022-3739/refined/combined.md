## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Best Quiz <= 1.0 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as Author to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Quiz » Add Categories.
2. Inset a category with the payload as name: <script>alert(1)</script>.
3. The XSS will be trigged when accessing the Add Categories dashboard again.

### Affects Plugins
