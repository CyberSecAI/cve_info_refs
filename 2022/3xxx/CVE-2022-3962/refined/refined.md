{
  "CVE-2022-3962": {
    "Description": "A content spoofing vulnerability was found in Kiali. It was discovered that Kiali does not implement error handling when the page or endpoint being accessed cannot be found. This issue allows an attacker to perform arbitrary text injection when an error response is retrieved from the URL being accessed.",
    "Root cause": "The Kiali UI does not properly handle error responses, specifically when a requested page or endpoint is not found. Instead of displaying a standard error, it allows arbitrary text injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Content spoofing"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary text into the Kiali UI by requesting a non-existent page/endpoint, potentially misleading users or creating a phishing-like scenario.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when accessed, causes Kiali to return an error, which the attacker can then manipulate to inject text into the Kiali UI.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs to send to the Kiali instance. No special privileges are required."
