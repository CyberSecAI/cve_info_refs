{
  "CVE-2022-3265": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input used as the color attribute for scoped labels. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "CSP Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session. This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including session hijacking, information theft, and performing actions on behalf of the user. It can also lead to denial-of-service attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker imports a project from a Github server with a malicious scoped label color.",
      "The malicious code is then stored and executed when the victim views a page where the label is rendered, such as issue/MR requests pages."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "A GitLab premium account.",
      "Ability to import a project from a Github server.",
       "Control over a Github server or the ability to inject malicious data there."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous fix for a similar issue with label colors, demonstrating a failure to account for scoped labels. The injected JavaScript can execute arbitrary REST API calls on behalf of the victim and can even perform a fake account takeover by changing the username and then registering a new account with the old username.",
     "remediation": "Mitigation should include proper input sanitization and validation of the label color attribute to prevent injection of malicious code."
