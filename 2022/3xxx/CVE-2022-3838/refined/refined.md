- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPUpper Share Buttons plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape its settings inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  High privilege users, such as administrators, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which is then executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, phishing, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting a crafted XSS payload into a vulnerable input field within the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (or other high privileges that have access to plugin settings). The attacker also needs the ability to save changes to the plugin settings.
