Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-3521:

**Root Cause:**
- A race condition exists in the Kernel Connection Multiplexor (KCM) subsystem.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Race condition leading to a null pointer dereference.
- Specifically, the `kcm_tx_work()` function might access `sk->sk_socket` after it has been freed. This can occur if another thread concurrently calls `kcm_release()` which calls `sock_orphan(sk)` while `sk` is not locked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to a null pointer dereference, leading to a denial-of-service.
- The provided KASAN report shows a null-ptr-deref in `instrument_atomic_write` which is triggered by a call to `clear_bit` in the `kcm_tx_work` function when `sk->sk_socket` is NULL.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between the `kcm_tx_work` function and the `kcm_release` function in the KCM subsystem.
- This race can occur when a socket is being closed/orphaned by `kcm_release`, potentially when a socket's reference count drops to zero. Meanwhile, `kcm_tx_work` is still in progress and attempts to access `sk->sk_socket`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- This is a local vulnerability that can be triggered by the race condition.
- The attacker would need to somehow trigger the `kcm_release` and `kcm_tx_work` functions concurrently, exploiting the race window.
- The Debian security advisories mention that this subsystem is not enabled by default in their configurations.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided git commit message includes a KASAN stack trace and details of the bug that was found by syzbot.
- The fix was to add `lock_sock(sk)` call in `kcm_release` function before calling `sock_orphan(sk)`. This prevents `kcm_tx_work` from racing and accessing the `sk_socket` pointer after it has been potentially freed.
- The Debian advisories indicate that this CVE affects Linux kernel versions 5.10 and 4.19.
