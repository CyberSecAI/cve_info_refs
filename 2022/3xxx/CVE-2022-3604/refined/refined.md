The provided content describes a CSV Injection vulnerability in the "Contact Form Entries" WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize user-submitted data before exporting it to a CSV file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation/sanitization when creating a CSV file.
- CSV injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user opens the exported CSV file using a spreadsheet application, any injected formulas within the CSV data will be executed. This can be used to perform actions like:
   - Disclosure of local file contents.
   - Execution of arbitrary code by exploiting other vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet program.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user submits a form with a malicious value (e.g., `=5+5`).
- The administrator exports the collected form data as a CSV file.
- Opening the exported CSV file with a spreadsheet program triggers the execution of the injected formula.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit form data that will be included in the exported CSV file. This would typically involve being a visitor to a website with the vulnerable plugin installed.
- The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the WordPress site. The vulnerability is triggered when the CSV is opened by a user, usually an administrator.
