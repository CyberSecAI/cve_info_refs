The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3070.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin "Generate PDF using Contact Form 7" does not sanitize or escape its settings, which allows for stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and escaping of input fields.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities. The impact is that even if unfiltered_html capability is disallowed, stored XSS attacks can be performed by high privilege users.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into input fields within the plugin settings page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin-level privileges (or another high-privilege user role) to access the plugin settings page and inject the malicious script.
