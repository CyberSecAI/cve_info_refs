The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3691.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The DeepL Pro API Translation plugin stores sensitive information, specifically the DeepL API key, in publicly accessible log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Sensitive Data Exposure: The plugin exposes the DeepL API key, which is considered sensitive data.
- Insecure Storage: The plugin stores sensitive data in publicly accessible log files.
- Lack of Access Control: The log files are accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the DeepL API key can allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions using the victim's DeepL account.
- The attacker could potentially incur costs or gain unauthorized access to data through the DeepL API.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct access to publicly accessible log files through a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the path to the log files on the vulnerable website. This path is usually predictable since it follows the WordPress uploads directory structure, i.e., `/wp-content/uploads/wpdeepl/`.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to access the log files.
