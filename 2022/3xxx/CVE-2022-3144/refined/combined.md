This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges, to inject JavaScript code into the setting that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

## Installation

Secure your website using the following steps to install Wordfence:

1. Install Wordfence automatically or by uploading the ZIP file.
2. Activate the Wordfence through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress. Wordfence is now activated.
3. Go to the scan menu and start your first scan. Scheduled scanning will also be enabled.
4. Once your first scan has completed, a list of threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.
5. Visit the Wordfence options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.
6. Optionally, change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual scanning and protection options for your site.
7. Click the “Live Traffic” menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.

To install Wordfence on WordPress Multi-Site installations:

1. Install Wordfence via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.
2. Network Activate Wordfence. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option disappears.
3. Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence will not appear on any individual site’s menu.
4. Go to the “Scan” menu and start your first scan.
5. Wordfence will do a scan of all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites.
6. Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB.
7. Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures. Crawler traffic is counted between blogs, so if you hit three sites in the network, all the hits are totalled and that counts as the rate you’re accessing the system.

### Do I need a security plugin like Wordfence if I’m using a cloud based firewall (WAF)?

Wordfence provides true endpoint security for your WordPress website. Unlike cloud based firewalls, Wordfence executes within the WordPress environment, giving it knowledge like whether the user is signed in, their identity and what access level they have. Wordfence uses the user’s access level in more than 80% of the firewall rules it uses to protect WordPress websites. Learn more about the [Cloud WAF identity problem here](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/10/endpoint-vs-cloud-security-cloud-waf-user-identity-problem/). Additionally, cloud based firewalls can be bypassed, leaving your site exposed to attackers. Because Wordfence is an integral part of the endpoint (your WordPress website), it can’t be bypassed. Learn more about the [Cloud WAF bypass problem here](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/10/endpoint-vs-cloud-security-cloud-waf-bypass-problem/). To fully protect the investment you’ve made in your website you need to employ a defense in depth approach to security. Wordfence takes this approach.

### What blocking features does Wordfence include?

* Real-time blocking of known attackers. If another site using Wordfence is attacked and blocks the attacker, your site is automatically protected.

* Choose whether you want to block or throttle users and robots who break your WordPress security rules.
* Premium users can also block countries and schedule scans for specific times and a higher frequency.

### What differentiates Wordfence from other WordPress Security plugins?

* Wordfence Security provides a WordPress Firewall developed specifically for WordPress and blocks attackers looking for vulnerabilities on your site. The Firewall is powered by our Threat Defense Feed which is continually updated as new threats emerge. Premium customers receive updates in real-time.
* Wordfence verifies your website source code integrity against the official WordPress repository and shows you the changes.
* Wordfence scans check all your files, comments and posts for URLs in Google’s Safe Browsing list. We are the only plugin to offer this very important security enhancement.

### Will Wordfence slow down my website?

No. Wordfence Security is extremely fast and uses techniques like caching its own configuration data to avoid database lookups and blocking malicious attacks that would slow down your site.

### What if my site has already been hacked?

Wordfence Security is able to repair core files, themes and plugins on sites where security is already compromised. You can follow this guide on [how to clean a hacked website using Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/). If you are cleaning your own site after a hack, note that site security cannot be assured unless you do a full reinstall if your site has been hacked. We recommend you only use Wordfence Security to get your site into a running state in order to recover the data you need to do a full reinstall. If you need help with a security issue, check out [Wordfence Care](https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-care/), which offers hands-on support from our team, including dealing with a hacked site. For mission-critical sites, check out [Wordfence Response](https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-response/).

### Does Wordfence Security support IPv6?

Yes. We fully support IPv6 with all security functions including country blocking, range blocking, city lookup, whois lookup and all other security functions. If you are not running IPv6, Wordfence will work great on your site too. We are fully compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6 whether you run both or only one addressing scheme.

### Does Wordfence Security support Multi-Site installations?

Yes. WordPress Multi-Site is fully supported. Using Wordfence you can scan every blog in your network for malware with one click. If one of your customers posts a page or post with a known malware URL that threatens your whole domain with being blocklisted by Google, we will alert you in the next scan.

I use Wordfence for all my client websites, and I couldn’t be happier with their service. The security features are top-notch, offering peace of mind with comprehensive protection. What really sets Wordfence apart, though, is their outstanding support team—they consistently go above and beyond to help with any issues. Whether it’s addressing a specific concern or offering guidance, they’re always responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Wordfence for anyone looking for reliable website security and exceptional customer service!

### [Free version is USELESS!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/free-version-is-useless-103/)

I had malicious code on my website that the free version of Wordfence didn’t detect. After contacting support, I received this reply:
“Thank you for reaching out. The malware sample you shared is detected by Wordfence Premium since last month. Signatures will be available to free users next week, as per our policy.”
So, essentially, if you’re using the free version, you’re vulnerable to known threats for over a month until signatures are released. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of the free version—what’s the point of installing it if it leaves users unprotected for so long?
