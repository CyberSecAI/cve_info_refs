Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `page_id` parameter when adding or editing metadata. Specifically, the code was using `FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW` which does not sanitize input, before this commit, allowing potentially malicious characters in the `page_id`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `page_id` was not being properly sanitized when it was received from user input.
*   **Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of sanitization on page\_id could allow injection of malicious scripts, if the value is later displayed unsanitized on a page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** If the `page_id` value is later displayed without proper output encoding, a malicious attacker could potentially inject and execute JavaScript code in the context of other user's browsers. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `page_id` parameter in requests to `ajax.config.php`, `meta.edit.php`, and `meta.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints with crafted `page_id` parameters. This likely requires being authenticated as an admin to access these functions.

**Additional Details:**

* The fix involves changing `FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW` to `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS` for the `page_id` parameter in `ajax.config.php`.
* The fix also adds `maxlength="48"` to the `page_id` input field in both `meta.edit.php` and `meta.php`, which could prevent excessively long inputs.
* The commit message "fix: add missing check on special characters for page ID" confirms the vulnerability and the implemented fix.
