The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3912.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly restrict file uploads via an AJAX action, making it possible for unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper file type validation: The plugin fails to properly validate the type of files being uploaded, allowing the upload of potentially malicious files such as PHP scripts.
- Unauthenticated access: The AJAX action responsible for handling file uploads is accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file upload: An attacker can upload malicious files, such as PHP files, to the server.
- Remote code execution (RCE): By uploading a PHP file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication required for exploiting the arbitrary file upload. A subscriber account is only needed to obtain a nonce required for the upload.
- The attacker needs to know the target URL of the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific POST request to trigger the vulnerable functionality.
