Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3995:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content includes a section specifically mentioning "TeraWallet – For WooCommerce <= 1.4.3 – Insecure Direct Object Reference" with the assigned CVE ID **CVE-2022-3995**. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the user-controlled `user_id` parameter in the `lock_unlock_terawallet` AJAX action within the TeraWallet plugin.
   - **Weakness:** The core weakness is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). This means the plugin doesn't properly verify if the current user has the permission to modify the specified user's wallet lock status before doing so.
   - **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to lock or unlock the wallets of other users, regardless of their own permissions, potentially disrupting legitimate users.
   - **Attack Vector:** The attack is performed through the `lock_unlock_terawallet` AJAX action.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions. They don't need administrative access to perform the attack.

**3. Technical Details from the Code:**

   - The `lock_unlock_terawallet` function in `class-woo-wallet-ajax.php` does have a `check_ajax_referer()` and sanitizes the `user_id` parameter.
   - However, the key issue lies in that it only verifies if the current user `current_user_can( 'edit_user', $user_id )` and not the user whose wallet is being locked/unlocked.
   - It updates user metadata using `update_user_meta` and `delete_user_meta` functions with the user ID provided in POST data.
   - The vulnerability exists because the function doesn't verify if the user performing the action has the necessary permissions to lock/unlock the specified user's wallet, allowing any authenticated user to manipulate other users' wallet states.

**4. Additional Information:**

   - The `readme.txt` file in the provided diff notes a fix for "Security issue on the function `lock_unlock_terawallet`." in version 1.4.4, which confirms that this vulnerability was addressed in the 1.4.4 release of the plugin.
   - The `woo-wallet.php` file also shows the version change from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4
   - The Wordfence advisory specifically highlights the vulnerability as an "Insecure Direct Object Reference."

**Summary**

The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) due to the insufficient validation of user permissions when locking/unlocking user wallets. This allows lower-privileged users to lock or unlock the wallets of other users, which should be restricted to administrator-level users.
