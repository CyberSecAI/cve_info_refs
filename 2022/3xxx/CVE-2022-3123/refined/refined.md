Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `difftype` parameter in DokuWiki's `inc/Ui/PageDiff.php` file. Specifically, the code was using the parameter directly in the HTML output without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `difftype` parameter, which controls the display of page differences, was not being sanitized before being included in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can be executed in the victim's browser.
- **Session hijacking:** The attacker could steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the victim's DokuWiki account.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website or display fake content within the DokuWiki page.
- **Malware delivery:** The attacker could potentially install malware on the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the injected JavaScript code within the `difftype` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker could trick a user into clicking the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `difftype` parameter.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit this URL (e.g., through a link on a webpage or email).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in the DokuWiki version 2022-07-31a "Igor", where the fix was implemented by applying HTML escaping using the `hsc()` function to the `difftype` parameter before outputting it into the HTML.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of DokuWiki and Fedora operating systems as indicated by the Fedora update notifications.
- The fix involves a single line change within the `inc/Ui/PageDiff.php` file.
- The related commit in the Dokuwiki Github repository has a commit hash of `63e9a247c072008a031f9db39fa496f6aca489b6`
