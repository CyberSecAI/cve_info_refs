- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Easy Video Player plugin fails to sanitize and escape specific parameters, leading to the possibility of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with Contributor or higher role can inject the malicious payload using a specific shortcode `[evp_embed_video url='" onerror=alert(/XSS/) "']` within a post. When a user previews the post, the XSS payload is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Contributor or higher user role on the vulnerable WordPress website.
