## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Video Player < 1.2.2.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escapes some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a new post and add the payload there: [evp\_embed\_video url='" onerror=alert(/XSS/) "']
2. Preview the post, and the XSS will trigger.

### Affects Plugins
