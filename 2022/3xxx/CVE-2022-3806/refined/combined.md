# Bluetooth HCI Error Handling Double Free

Low

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-w525-fm68-ppq3
Jan 19, 2023

## Package

zephyr
(west)

## Affected versions

<= 3.2

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Inconsistent handling of error cases in bluetooth hci may lead

to a double free condition of a network buffer.

# Details

In a bluetooth driver, when sending a packet via `bt_send` fails in the

lower driver's send function (such as `bt_spi_send`), then the

convention is that the ownership remains with the caller of `bt_send`.

This means that in the error case, the caller of `bt_send` will clean up

all references to the netbuf it provided to `bt_send(net_buf *buf)`.

This convention is observed by most driver functions. For example:

`h4_send` handles sending packets by indicating success in all cases

initially, and then cleaning up the reference itself.

* Indicating success in `h4_send`

  [zephyr/drivers/bluetooth/hci/h4.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861/drivers/bluetooth/hci/h4.c#L489)

  Line 489
  in
  [8a26265](/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
* Un-referencing the buffer in the processing loop `process_tx`:

  [zephyr/drivers/bluetooth/hci/h4.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861/drivers/bluetooth/hci/h4.c#L442)

  Line 442
  in
  [8a26265](/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861)

  |  | net\_buf\_unref(tx.buf); |
  | --- | --- |

This is, however, not always adhered to. For example:

1. `bt_spi_send` netbuf is unreferenced in the error case

   `bt_spi_transceive` fails:

   [zephyr/drivers/bluetooth/hci/spi.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861/drivers/bluetooth/hci/spi.c#L446)

   Line 446
   in
   [8a26265](/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861)

   |  | goto out; |
   | --- | --- |

   (however, other error cases do not unreference the netbuf. For example,

   the case of a too long buffer:

   [zephyr/drivers/bluetooth/hci/spi.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861/drivers/bluetooth/hci/spi.c#L429)

   Line 429
   in
   [8a26265](/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861)

   |  | } while ((rxmsg[STATUS\_HEADER\_READY] != READY\_NOW || |
   | --- | --- |

   )
2. `bt_esp32_send` unreferences the netbuf in the timeout error case:

   [zephyr/drivers/bluetooth/hci/hci\_esp32.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861/drivers/bluetooth/hci/hci_esp32.c#L269)

   Line 269
   in
   [8a26265](/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861)

   |  | err = -ETIMEDOUT; |
   | --- | --- |

   (for the other error case "unknown type", however, the function

   indicates a zero result, in which case the convention is not broken. So

   only the presumably much less frequently observed timeout case breaks

   the convention)

Bug trigger source code references:

* `bt_spi_send` unref despite error case

  [zephyr/drivers/bluetooth/hci/spi.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861/drivers/bluetooth/hci/spi.c#L446)

  Line 446
  in
  [8a26265](/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861)

  |  | goto out; |
  | --- | --- |
* `hci_tx_thread->process_events->send_cmd` buffer un-referencing for

  `bt_send` error:

  [zephyr/subsys/bluetooth/host/hci\_core.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861/subsys/bluetooth/host/hci_core.c#L2435)

  Line 2435
  in
  [8a26265](/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/8a262651af83d4a3257a5e0acbe0b3609ca6c861)

  |  | net\_buf\_unref(buf); |
  | --- | --- |

For completeness, the different hci implementations should be re-checked

for exhibiting this issue depending on error code paths.

A possible attack scenario here could be an attacker who compromised a

radio chip and then proceeds to attack the bluetooth host stack via the

HCI interface. Such an attacker could also be in a position to induce

SPI errors on the sending side such as spamming traffic or indicating

errors to the sender (e.g., in spi flow control). An attacker which is

able to induce errors in different SPI bluetooth sending functions can

cause a double free scenario on a network buffer. I have not checked the

exploitability of this specific situation, but apart from a simple crash

(DoS), double frees are typically a strong primitive for an attacker to

achieve more with this, such as RCE.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
