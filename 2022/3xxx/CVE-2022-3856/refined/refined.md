- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `id` parameter in the `admin.php` page with the `cbms_weekly_picks_admin` page and `update_picks` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least admin level privileges.
