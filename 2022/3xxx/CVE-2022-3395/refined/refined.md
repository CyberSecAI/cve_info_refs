- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin directly uses the contents of the `cc_sql` POST parameter as a database query without sanitization or proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious SQL query in the `cc_sql` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the permission to perform exports. By default, only administrators have this permission, but this can be delegated to lower privileged users.
