- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'Ask Me' theme allows post deletion via a crafted link without requiring a nonce or confirmation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into deleting a post on the site without their consent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious link to a specific post deletion endpoint of the vulnerable theme and sends it to the victim. If the victim is logged into the target site and clicks the link, the post is deleted without their knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the delete post request of the vulnerable theme and have the ability to send a crafted link to a logged-in user of the target site. The attacker also needs to know the ID of the post they want to delete.
