# Ask Me < 6.8.7 - Post Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin has a CSRF vulnerability that allows the deletion of a post without using a nonce or prompting for confirmation.

### Proof of Concept

An attacker can log in to their own account, grab the link structure of the post-deletion request, and then forge it to the victim's post ID and send it to the victim. As soon as the victim accesses the link, the post will be deleted without asking for confirmation or using a nonce.
