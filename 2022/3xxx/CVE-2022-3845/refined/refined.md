The provided content relates to CVE-2022-3845.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input during import previews. Specifically, the vulnerability was present in the `app/admin/import-export/import-load-data.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of proper input sanitization/escaping of user-provided data within the import preview functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the import preview, which would be executed within the browsers of users who access the compromised preview. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or other browser-based attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves uploading a malicious CSV/XLS file or crafting a specific payload that will cause malicious javascript to execute during the import preview, due to lack of sanitization of data coming from the uploaded files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to upload a CSV or XLS file and preview it to exploit the vulnerability. This requires the attacker to have access to the import functionality of the application and the ability to upload arbitrary files.
