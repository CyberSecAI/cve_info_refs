## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Highlight Focus <= 1.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in any of the plugins settings (Settings > Highlight Focus): "><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>

### Affects Plugins
