  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-3896",
    "description": "The WP Affiliate Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via $_SERVER[\"REQUEST_URI\"] in versions up to, and including, 6.3.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is unlikely to work in modern browsers.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `$_SERVER[\"REQUEST_URI\"]` variable.",
    "vulnerability": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
     "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in the victim's browser if they can trick the victim into clicking a specially crafted link. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or the execution of malicious code on the victim's machine",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `$_SERVER[\"REQUEST_URI\"]` variable.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
