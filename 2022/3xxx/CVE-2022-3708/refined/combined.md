**Publication Date:** 2022-11-14

The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized setting changes by unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient validation of settings on the ‘tp\_translation’ AJAX action which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any restrictions and influence the data shown on the site. Please note this is a separate issue from CVE-2022-2461. Notes from the researcher: When installed Transposh comes with a set of pre-configured options, one of these is the “Who can translate” setting under the “Settings” tab. However, this option is largely ignored, if Transposh has enabled its “autotranslate” feature (it’s enabled by default) and the HTTP POST parameter “sr0” is larger than 0. This is caused by a faulty validation in “wp/transposh\_db.php.”

### Description

The Web Stories plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.24.0 due to insufficient validation of URLs supplied via the 'url' parameter found via the /v1/hotlink/proxy REST API Endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated users to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.

## FAQ

Thank you for being an early adopter of Web Stories for WordPress! We’re working around the clock to improve your experience and add editing capabilities. If you find any issues, please reach out by visiting the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/web-stories/) to ask any questions or file feature requests.

### What browsers are supported?

**For an optimal Web Story creation experience**, we recommend using the latest version of commonly popular web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Is Web Stories for WordPress compatible with other WordPress plugins?

Because the Web Story format is new to the web ecosystem, some WordPress plugins may need extra support. We are working to improve compatibility with the Web Story editor and encourage you to file any bugs and requests in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/web-stories/).

### Can I use Web Stories for WordPress on a touch screen?

The Web Story editor is not currently supported on touch screen devices, such as a smartphone or tablet.

### How do I make Web Stories appear in Google and other search engines?

For better chances of being discovered, after publishing your Web Story, we encourage you to embed it into a regular article or post on your site by using the Web Stories Gutenberg block.

While the default sitemaps in WordPress and most popular plugins handle it automatically, we encourage you to check that your Web Stories are included in your XML sitemaps.

### How can I optimize Web Stories to show up on search engines?

Web Stories created using Web Stories for WordPress use what’s provided in the Document tab inside the editor to generate schema.org and social meta-data automatically. Ensure you review and update all requested metadata, including cover image, excerpt and publisher logo. Please see [SEO for Web Stories](https://blog.amp.dev/2020/02/12/seo-for-amp-stories/) for further SEO guidance.

### How do I implement Analytics in my Web Stories?

There are two ways to include analytics in your Web Stories:

* Add your Google Analytics ID in the “Settings”.
* If you use the [Site Kit by Google](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-site-kit/) WordPress plugin, you can set up Google Analytics there.

### What do I do about an AMP validation issue in Search Console?

Web Stories are powered by [AMP](https://amp.dev/), which adds some restrictions on a page’s allowed markup. In some cases, other WordPress plugins use disallowed markup. We recommend temporarily disabling these plugins and reaching out to our [support forum](https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-stories/).

### Where can I report bugs?

For help requests, support questions, or general feedback, please reach out via the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-stories/).

Reproducible bug reports can be filed [on GitHub](https://github.com/googleforcreators/web-stories-wp/).

To report a vulnerability in this plugin, please contact the Google Security Team at [g.co/vulnz](https://g.co/vulnz).

I’m using the Web Stories plugin on my WordPress site, but I’m encountering an issue where images I upload are disappearing after a short time. They’re successfully added initially, but when I check back, they’re removed without any notification or error message. I’ve tried troubleshooting this with caching and image optimization settings but haven’t been able to pinpoint the cause. Has anyone else experienced this or have suggestions for resolving it?

[NaomiLiz](https://profiles.wordpress.org/naomiliz/ "Posts by NaomiLiz")
August 20, 2023

The interface is intuitive and this has the potential to be a great plugin, but it’s so incredibly slow and buggy. Sometimes it takes me a solid 30-40 seconds to simply move a slide to another position – just one example of many things that should be quick and easy, but take FOREVER. I love being able to create web stories in this easy format (4-5 stars for that), but the user experience makes it extremely painful (2 stars for the slowness). I am sure I could create these 2 – 3x as fast if it weren’t for how glitchy the plugin is.
All that said, I’m continuing to use it as I don’t know of a better alternative, and I would absolutely LOVE to update this to a 5 star review eventually if they can streamline and speed things up (significantly).
Please, Google. Help us out.

### [Publish stories turn to code and no story](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/publish-stories-turn-to-code-and-no-story/)

I created story for an hour because I used it for the first time. I was excited to publish it but after I publish, I see the story for the first time however, when I share it to someone the link display code and no story created. After I refresh, the story is empty that looks like I need to create it again, however, I’m tired so I just uninstall it.

## FAQ

Thank you for being an early adopter of Web Stories for WordPress! We’re working around the clock to improve your experience and add editing capabilities. If you find any issues, please reach out by visiting the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/web-stories/) to ask any questions or file feature requests.

### What browsers are supported?

**For an optimal Web Story creation experience**, we recommend using the latest version of commonly popular web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Is Web Stories for WordPress compatible with other WordPress plugins?

Because the Web Story format is new to the web ecosystem, some WordPress plugins may need extra support. We are working to improve compatibility with the Web Story editor and encourage you to file any bugs and requests in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/web-stories/).

### Can I use Web Stories for WordPress on a touch screen?

The Web Story editor is not currently supported on touch screen devices, such as a smartphone or tablet.

### How do I make Web Stories appear in Google and other search engines?

For better chances of being discovered, after publishing your Web Story, we encourage you to embed it into a regular article or post on your site by using the Web Stories Gutenberg block.

While the default sitemaps in WordPress and most popular plugins handle it automatically, we encourage you to check that your Web Stories are included in your XML sitemaps.

### How can I optimize Web Stories to show up on search engines?

Web Stories created using Web Stories for WordPress use what’s provided in the Document tab inside the editor to generate schema.org and social meta-data automatically. Ensure you review and update all requested metadata, including cover image, excerpt and publisher logo.

### How do I implement Analytics in my Web Stories?

There are two ways to include analytics in your Web Stories:

* Add your Google Analytics ID in the “Settings”.
* If you use the [Site Kit by Google](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-site-kit/) WordPress plugin, you can set up Google Analytics there.

### What do I do about an AMP validation issue in Search Console?

Web Stories are powered by [AMP](https://amp.dev/), which adds some restrictions on a page’s allowed markup. In some cases, other WordPress plugins use disallowed markup. We recommend temporarily disabling these plugins and reaching out to our [support forum](https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-stories/).

### Where can I report bugs?

For help requests, support questions, or general feedback, please reach out via the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-stories/).

Reproducible bug reports can be filed [on GitHub](https://github.com/googleforcreators/web-stories-wp/).

To report a vulnerability in this plugin, please contact the Google Security Team at [g.co/vulnz](https://g.co/vulnz).

### [Images Automatically Disappearing in Web Stories Plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/images-automatically-disappearing-in-web-stories-plugin/)

I’m using the Web Stories plugin on my WordPress site, but I’m encountering an issue where images I upload are disappearing after a short time. They’re successfully added initially, but when I check back, they’re removed without any notification or error message. I’ve tried troubleshooting this with caching and image optimization settings but haven’t been able to pinpoint the cause. Has anyone else experienced this or have suggestions for resolving it?

<p class=””>I don’t know if anyone else is facing this issue but, the interface is extremely slow. Any click on any item takes around 8-10 seconds to react. Not sure if this will ever get resolved?</p>

### [Intuitive interface but incredibly slow, buggy, clunky](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/intuitive-interface-but-incredibly-slow-buggy-clunky/)

The interface is intuitive and this has the potential to be a great plugin, but it’s so incredibly slow and buggy. Sometimes it takes me a solid 30-40 seconds to simply move a slide to another position – just one example of many things that should be quick and easy, but take FOREVER. I love being able to create web stories in this easy format (4-5 stars for that), but the user experience makes it extremely painful (2 stars for the slowness). I am sure I could create these 2 – 3x as fast if it weren’t for how glitchy the plugin is.
All that said, I’m continuing to use it as I don’t know of a better alternative, and I would absolutely LOVE to update this to a 5 star review eventually if they can streamline and speed things up (significantly).
Please, Google. Help us out.

I created story for an hour because I used it for the first time. I was excited to publish it but after I publish, I see the story for the first time however, when I share it to someone the link display code and no story created. After I refresh, the story is empty that looks like I need to create it again, however, I’m tired so I just uninstall it.
