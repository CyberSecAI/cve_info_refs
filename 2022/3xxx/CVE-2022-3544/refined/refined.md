This commit fixes a memory leak in the Linux kernel's DAMON (Data Access Monitoring) subsystem.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `damon_sysfs_add_target` function within the DAMON sysfs interface.
- When `damon_sysfs_add_target` fails to find a proper task (identified by a PID), it allocates a `damon_target` structure but does not register it.
- If the function returns due to not finding the task, this newly allocated memory cannot be freed by `damon_sysfs_destroy_targets` because it was never registered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Memory leak: Unreleased memory leads to resource exhaustion over time.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Repeatedly triggering the failure condition in `damon_sysfs_add_target` would lead to a gradual memory leak, potentially causing a denial of service by exhausting system memory.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `damon_sysfs_add_target` function with an invalid process id through the sysfs interface. This interaction could occur through local access or potentially via a network service that exposes the sysfs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to interact with the `damon_sysfs` interface, which typically requires local access with appropriate permissions to write to the relevant sysfs files.
- The attacker must provide an invalid PID to trigger the allocation and leak.

**Technical details:**

- The fix moves the `damon_add_target(ctx, t);` call immediately after the memory allocation of the `damon_target` structure to ensure the target structure is registered, even if the task check subsequently fails. This enables the structure to be properly freed by the `damon_sysfs_destroy_targets` function if needed.

- The relevant code change is moving the `damon_add_target(ctx, t);` call before the check for the pid (`damon_target_has_pid`)
