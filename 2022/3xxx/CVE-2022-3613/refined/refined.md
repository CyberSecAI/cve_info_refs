Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control and query sanitization in the Grafana integration proxy endpoint within GitLab. This allows unauthenticated users (for public projects) to send arbitrary PromQL queries to the configured Prometheus server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The `/grafana/proxy/` endpoint does not properly restrict access based on user roles. Unauthenticated users can access it for public projects.
*   **Arbitrary Query Execution:** The proxy endpoint passes through user-provided PromQL queries to the Prometheus server without any restrictions or sanitization. This allows attackers to craft complex and resource-intensive queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause a DoS on the Prometheus server by sending heavy PromQL queries. This can lead to high CPU usage, making the server unresponsive and potentially impacting the entire GitLab instance.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The attack can lead to resource exhaustion on the server, particularly CPU, causing instability.
*   **Impact on Monitoring:** The DoS on the Prometheus server disrupts the monitoring capabilities of GitLab which rely on this service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker only requires network access to the GitLab instance.
*   **Public Project:** The vulnerability is exploitable against public projects, even by unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:**  For public projects, the attacker does not need any authentication.
*   **Knowledge of the Project:** The attacker needs to know the project path and the Prometheus datasource ID.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, for example using `curl`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attacker uses a 'cache buster' technique by varying the query string to force the GitLab backend to send each request to the Prometheus server.
*   The vulnerability is not related to the Grafana instance but the GitLab proxy functionality.
*   The exploit can lead to a state where the Prometheus server is so unresponsive it cannot even be stopped via command.

**Proposed Solution (From the report):**

The proposed solution is to elevate the required access levels to `Reporter+` for *public* projects when using the Grafana integration, leaving private/protected projects as-is. This means anonymous users of public projects would not be able to query through the proxy.
