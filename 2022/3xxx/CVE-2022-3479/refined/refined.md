Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-3479:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `CERT_FindUserCertsByUsage` function in the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library. This function can return a NULL certificate list, which is not properly handled by subsequent filtering functions, `CERT_FilterCertListByCANames`. Specifically, a missing NULL check after `CERT_FindUserCertsByUsage` leads to a crash when the client attempts to perform client authentication without a user certificate available in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Null pointer dereference:** The primary weakness is a missing check for a NULL certificate list before passing it to the filtering functions. This results in a null pointer dereference and a crash when the server requests client authentication but the client has no certificates.
- Improper error handling: The filtering functions do not handle NULL CERTCertLists correctly, which leads to the crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of service:** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. The application using the vulnerable NSS library will crash.
- While the specific documentation does not mention this, it is theoretically possible a malicous server could trigger this flaw and crash any client software using the vulnerable NSS.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious server:** A malicious server could request client authentication when the client does not have any certificates, triggering the crash on the client side.
- **Legitimate server:** A legitimate server can inadvertently trigger the vulnerability in clients that have no configured client certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs to be in a position to act as a server that can request client certificate authentication. This can be a MITM attack as well.
- The client must not have a valid user certificate configured.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability primarily affects client applications using the NSS library directly.
- Firefox is not directly affected because it overrides the default user certificate handler. However, other applications relying on NSS's default behavior will be vulnerable.
- The fix involves adding a null check immediately after the `CERT_FindUserCertsByUsage` function call and ensuring that filtering functions can handle NULL certificate lists gracefully.
- The fix is included in NSS 3.87 and later versions.

The provided information indicates the vulnerability can be triggered remotely, leading to a client crash, hence its designation as "high severity" and "exploitable remote".
