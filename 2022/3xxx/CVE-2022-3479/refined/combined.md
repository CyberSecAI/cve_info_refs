The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")â€Ž | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

Attached patch

[nss-3.79-fix-client-cert-crash.patch](attachment.cgi?id=9281679&action=diff)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9281679&action=edit)
â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1774654&attachment=9281679)

The patch for [bug 1552254](/show_bug.cgi?id=1552254 "RESOLVED FIXED - internal_error alert on Certificate Request with sha1+ecdsa in TLS 1.3") contains an error where we check for a empty list, but the list is NULL. This can happen if the server requests a client auth cert, but the client has no certs in it's database. The crash happens in the default auth cert handler, which firefox overrides, so firefox does not have this issue, but other client applications (like tstclient) can crash. I'm including the upstream patch. I'll attach a phabricator patch shortly.

Even though the target milestone is tagged to 3.81, I don't see this fix even on 3.84. It would also be great to have an ESR release with this in, if possible. From a quick glance the codebase looks to match.

Bob can you submit your patch through phab? FWIW, I think the null check needs to be immediately after `CERT_FindUserCertsByUsage`, or we can crash in `CERT_FilterCertListByCANames` in the `!chosenNickName` case. Probably `CERT_FilterCertListByCANames` should also have a null check.

john, You are correct. The patch attached to this bug is old and incomplete. I have a better patch I'll push to fabricator.

â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9307434&action=edit)

The filter functions do not handle NULL CERTCertLists, but CERT\_FindUserCertsByUsage can return a NULL cert list. If it returns a NULL list, we should just

fail at the point (there are no certs available).

Shouldn't this also get uplifted to ESR?

It doesn't need to be. It doesn't affect Firefox. The code in question is a default get UserCert handler which isn't used by Firefox.

The patch applies cleanly to ESR. We've patched the version ourselves now, so we're fine.

But I think *in principle*, NSS ESR is also supported standalone? Therefore it should also get all security fixes that don't affect Firefox.
