| Summary Hi, developers of Bento4: I tested the binary mp4edit and mp42hevc with my fuzzer, and three crashes incurred, including two memory-leaks from mp4edit and a heap-overflow from mp42hevc. And I think Bug1 and Bug2 are different. The following is the details. Bug1 Detected memory leaks in mp4edit.  ``` root@25467sd2gsg311:/fuzz-mp4edit/mp4edit# ./mp4edit poc_mp4edit_111062493 /dev/null WARNING: atom serialized to fewer bytes than declared size WARNING:
