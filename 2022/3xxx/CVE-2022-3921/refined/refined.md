- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Listingo theme does not validate files uploaded via an AJAX action, which is accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a POST request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=listingo_temp_uploader`) with a file to upload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can upload arbitrary files through the publicly accessible AJAX endpoint.
