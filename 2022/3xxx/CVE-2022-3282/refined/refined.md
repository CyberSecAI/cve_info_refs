Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly validate the file upload size limit. Instead of relying on server-side configurations or admin-set limits, the plugin uses a user-supplied `size_limit` parameter in the POST request when submitting the form, leading to a file upload size limit bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **File Upload Size Limit Bypass:** The plugin trusts user-provided input for the file size limit, allowing attackers to bypass the intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Size Uploads:** Attackers can upload files larger than what the administrator intended, potentially leading to resource exhaustion on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the WordPress `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint**: The attacker needs to know the endpoint URL (`admin-ajax.php`) and the required parameters (e.g., `size_limit`, `action`, `type`, `form_id`, `upload_name`).

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can use `curl` to bypass the upload size limit by setting the `size_limit` parameter to a large value (10485760).
*   The affected plugin is "Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload" versions prior to 1.3.6.5.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.6.5.
*   The vulnerability was publicly published on 2022-09-26
