## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Flowplayer Video Player < 1.0.5 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put, the following shortcode in a page/post
[flowplayer src='" onerror=alert(/XSS/) "']
The XSS will be triggered when viewing/previewing the page/post
