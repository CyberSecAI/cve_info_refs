The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3968.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within the `tag` field in `admin/article_save.php`. The original code uses `addslashes` which is inadequate for preventing XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the `tag` field. This script could be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Information disclosure
  - Defacement of the web page
  - Other malicious actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface, by manipulating the `tag` parameter when saving an article.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit articles, which might require administrative or author-level privileges on the system. The attacker also needs to have the knowledge and ability to craft malicious payloads for XSS exploitation.

**Detailed Explanation**
The code change shows the following modification:
```diff
$tagstring = isset($_POST['tag']) ? addslashes(trim($_POST['tag'])) : '';
$tagstring = isset($_POST['tag']) ? strip_tags(addslashes(trim($_POST['tag']))) : '';
```

The original code only uses `addslashes()`, which is intended to escape characters for database queries and not for preventing XSS. The fix replaces this with `strip_tags()`, and only then with `addslashes()`. `strip_tags()` will remove any HTML tags included by a malicious user, which prevents the XSS vulnerability.
