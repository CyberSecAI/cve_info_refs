The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3800.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `/packages/api/database.go` file of the go-ibax project. Specifically, the `table_name` parameter is not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`table_name`) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Spoof identity: An attacker can potentially impersonate other users.
- Tamper with existing data: Attackers can modify or corrupt data stored in the database.
- Disclosure of all data: Sensitive data within the database can be exposed.
- Data destruction: Attackers can delete or make data unavailable.
- Complete compromise of the database server: Attackers can gain administrative access to the database server, allowing full control.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests to the `/api/v2/open/rowsInfo` endpoint.
- The `table_name` parameter is the vulnerable input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication appears to be required in the identified vulnerable endpoint.
