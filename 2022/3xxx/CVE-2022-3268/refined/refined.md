**Relevant Vulnerabilities Addressed in Commit 7b5c7e6:**
The commit message and README.md changes indicate that the following vulnerabilities were addressed:

*   **CSRF on repository deletion and user deletion:**
    *   **Weakness:** CSRF vulnerability during deletion of repositories and users.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions, such as deleting repositories or user accounts.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious website or link could be used to trigger a request that deletes resources while the victim is logged into the application.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious page while they have an active session.
    *   **CVE:** CVE-2022-3232

*   **CSRF in profile's SSH Keys:**
    *   **Weakness:** CSRF vulnerability when managing SSH keys in user profiles.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could add or remove SSH keys from a user's profile, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious website or link could be used to trigger a request that modifies SSH keys while the victim is logged into the application.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious page while they have an active session.
    *   **CVE:** CVE-2022-3221

*   **Insecure Cookie Attribute:**
    *   **Weakness:** Sensitive cookies are not using the `Secure` attribute.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive cookies could be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, which could be intercepted and used by attackers.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network interception of HTTP requests.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be positioned to eavesdrop on the network traffic.
    *   **CVE:** CVE-2022-3174

*   **Stack Trace Leakage:**
    *   **Weakness:** Stack traces are revealed in the default error page.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could use the information to gain more insight into the application's structure, possibly aiding in future attacks.
    *    **Attack Vector:** Triggering an error that causes the application to return a stack trace in the default error page.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to cause an error.
    *   **CVE:** CVE-2022-3175

*   **Missing Password Length Enforcement:**
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of password length restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** Users might set weak passwords, more vulnerable to attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** User choosing an easily guessable password.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can gain access using a brute-force or dictionary attack to guess passwords.
    *    **CVE:** CVE-2022-3179
*   **Missing Clickjacking Defense**
    *   **Weakness:** Missing Clickjacking protection
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could trick an user into performing actions by displaying the application inside a malicious frame.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Displaying the application in an iframe and overlaying deceptive elements.
    *    **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to display the application inside a frame.
    *   **CVE:** CVE-2022-3167

*   **Brute-Force Attack Mitigation:**
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient client IP identification.
    *   **Impact:** Susceptible to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Brute-force login attempts.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send login requests to the application.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use `X-Real-IP` to identify client IP address
