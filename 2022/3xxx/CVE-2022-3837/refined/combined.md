## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Uji Countdown < 2.3.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. In the settings of the plugin add the payload in the input boxes: 123" onmouseenter=alert(/XSS/) " and save the changes.
2. Refresh or re-enter the page and move the mouse over the input box to get the XSS trigger.
