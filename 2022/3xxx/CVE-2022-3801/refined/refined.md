Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `order` parameter in the `/packages/api/database.go` file of the `go-ibax` project. The `order` parameter is directly incorporated into SQL queries without any escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `order` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoof Identity:** Attackers can potentially manipulate data to spoof identities.
*   **Tamper with Data:**  Attackers can modify or corrupt existing data within the database.
*  **Complete Data Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to all data stored within the system's database, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **Data Destruction/Unavailability:** Attackers can delete or render data inaccessible.
*   **Database Server Takeover:**  In a worst-case scenario, the vulnerability could allow attackers to gain administrative access to the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `/api/v2/open/rowsInfo` endpoint.
*   The `order` parameter within the POST data is the primary attack vector.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) shows that by injecting SQL code into the `order` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, for example, using `pg_sleep` to verify SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `/api/v2/open/rowsInfo` endpoint.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported to affect versions starting from commits on Jul 18, 2020
*   The vulnerability is present in two locations within the `database.go` file (lines 186-189).
*   The code constructs SQL queries using `fmt.Sprintf` and directly injects the `order` parameter without any sanitization.
*   The provided POC demonstrates the vulnerability using both a basic SQL injection and also one including a `where` parameter.
* The issue was fixed in commit `b0183d8e550836dc50282ee74ff421ee41b25a37`.
