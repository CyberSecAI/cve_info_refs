Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-2978

    "butt3rflyh4ck", Hao Sun, and Jiacheng Xu reported a flaw in the
    nilfs2 filesystem driver which can lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local use might be able to exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-3521

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the KCM subsystem
    which could lead to a crash.

    This subsystem is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3524

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the IPv6 stack which
    could lead to a memory leak.  A local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3564

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3565

    A flaw was discovered in the mISDN driver which would lead to a
    use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-3594

    Andrew Gaul reported that the r8152 Ethernet driver would log
    excessive numbers of messages in response to network errors.  A
    remote attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3621, CVE-2022-3646

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a null pointer dereference or memory leak.  A user
    permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem images could use these to
    cause a denial of service (crash or resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3628

    Dokyung Song, Jisoo Jang, and Minsuk Kang reported a potential
    heap-based buffer overflow in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi driver.  A user
    able to connect a malicious USB device could exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3640

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3643 (XSA-423)

    A flaw was discovered in the Xen network backend driver that would
    result in it generating malformed packet buffers.  If these
    packets were forwarded to certain other network devices, a Xen
    guest could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    device reset).

CVE-2022-3649

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystem images could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4378

    Kyle Zeng found a flaw in procfs that would cause a stack-based
    buffer overflow.  A local user permitted to write to a sysctl
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-20369

    A flaw was found in the v4l2-mem2mem media driver that would lead
    to an out-of-bounds write.  A local user with access to such a
    device could exploit this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-29901

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel
    processors (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against
    speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in
    some circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code
    execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    More information can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>

CVE-2022-40768

    "hdthky" reported that the stex SCSI adapter driver did not fully
    initialise a structure that is copied to user-space.  A local user
    with access to such a device could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information.

CVE-2022-41849

    A race condition was discovered in the smscufx graphics driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A user able to remove the
    physical device while also accessing its device node could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41850

    A race condition was discovered in the hid-roccat input driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user able to access
    such a device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329 (XSA-424)

    Yang Yingliang reported that the Xen network backend driver did
    not use the proper function to free packet buffers in one case,
    which could lead to a deadlock.  A Xen guest could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2022-42895

    Tam√°s Koczka reported a flaw in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem
    that would result in reading uninitialised memory.  A nearby
    attacker able to make a Bluetooth connection could exploit
    this to leak sensitive information.

CVE-2022-42896

    Tam√°s Koczka reported flaws in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem that
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A nearby attacker able to make a
    Bluetooth SMP connection could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2022-43750

    The syzbot tool found that the USB monitor (usbmon) driver allowed
    user-space programs to overwrite the driver's data structures.  A
    local user permitted to access a USB monitor device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  However, by default only the
    root user can access such devices.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.269-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

nilfs2: fix leak of nilfs\_root in case of writer thread creation failureIf nilfs\_attach\_log\_writer() failed to create a log writer thread, it
frees a data structure of the log writer without any cleanup. After
commit e912a5b66837 ("nilfs2: use root object to get ifile"), this causes
a leak of struct nilfs\_root, which started to leak an ifile metadata inode
and a kobject on that struct.
In addition, if the kernel is booted with panic\_on\_warn, the above
ifile metadata inode leak will cause the following panic when the
nilfs2 kernel module is removed:

Debian Bug     : 1017425 1019248

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-4037

    Christian Brauner reported that the inode_init_owner function for
    the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel allows local users to
    create files with an unintended group ownership allowing attackers
    to escalate privileges by making a plain file executable and SGID.

CVE-2022-0171

    Mingwei Zhang reported that a cache incoherence issue in the SEV
    API in the KVM subsystem may result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-1184

    A flaw was discovered in the ext4 filesystem driver which can lead
    to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1679

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the ath9k_htc driver
    which can lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to
    cause a denial service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2153

    "kangel" reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
    user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-2602

    A race between handling an io_uring request and the Unix socket
    garbage collector was discovered. An attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw for local privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2663

    David Leadbeater reported flaws in the nf_conntrack_irc
    connection-tracking protocol module. When this module is enabled
    on a firewall, an external user on the same IRC network as an
    internal user could exploit its lax parsing to open arbitrary TCP
    ports in the firewall, to reveal their public IP address, or to
    block their IRC connection at the firewall.

CVE-2022-2905

    Hsin-Wei Hung reported a flaw in the eBPF verifier which can lead
    to an out-of-bounds read.  If unprivileged use of eBPF is enabled,
    this could leak sensitive information.  This was already disabled
    by default, which would fully mitigate the vulnerability.

CVE-2022-3028

    Abhishek Shah reported a race condition in the AF_KEY subsystem,
    which could lead to an out-of-bounds write or read.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption), to obtain sensitive information, or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3061

    A flaw was discovered in the i740 driver which may result in
    denial of service.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3176

    A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the io_uring subsystem
    which may result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-3303

    A race condition in the snd_pcm_oss_sync function in the sound
    subsystem in the Linux kernel due to improper locking may result
    in denial of service.

CVE-2022-3586 (ZDI-22-1452)

    The Zero Day Initiative reported a flaw in the sch_sfb network
    scheduler, which may lead to a use-after-free and leak of
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2022-3621, CVE-2022-3646

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a null pointer dereference or memory leak.  A user
    permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem images could use these to
    cause a denial of service (crash or resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3625

    A flaw was discovered in the devlink subsystem which can lead to
    a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2022-3629

    The syzbot tool found a memory leak in the Virtual Socket Protocol
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3633

    The Linux Verification Center found a memory leak in the SAE J1939
    protocol implementation.  A local user could exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3635

    Several race conditions were discovered in the idt77252 ATM
    driver, which can lead to a use-after-free if the module is
    removed.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2022-3649

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystem images could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-20421

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the
    binder_inc_ref_for_node function in the Android binder driver. On
    systems where the binder driver is loaded, a local user could
    exploit this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-20422

    A race condition was discovered in the instruction emulator for
    64-bit Arm systems.  Concurrent changes to the sysctls that
    control the emulator could result in a null pointer dereference.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2022-39188

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the kernel's handling of
    unmapping of certain memory ranges. When a driver created a memory
    mapping with the VM_PFNMAP flag, which many GPU drivers do, the
    memory mapping could be removed and freed before it was flushed
    from the CPU TLBs. This could result in a page use-after-free. A
    local user with access to such a device could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-39190

    Gwangun Jung reported a flaw in the nf_tables subsystem.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-39842

    An integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver
    which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-40307

    A race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,
    which could lead to use-after-free. A local user permitted to
    access this device (/dev/efi_capsule_loader) could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation. However, this device is normally only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2022-41222

    A race condition was discovered in the memory management subsystem
    that can lead to stale TLB entries.  A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    information leak, or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41674, CVE-2022-42719, CVE-2022-42720, CVE-2022-42721,
CVE-2022-42722

    Soenke Huster discovered several vulnerabilities in the mac80211
    subsystem triggered by WLAN frames which may result in denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-43750

    The syzbot tool found that the USB monitor (usbmon) driver allowed
    user-space programs to overwrite the driver's data structures.  A
    local user permitted to access a USB monitor device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  However, by default only the
    root user can access such devices.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.149-2~deb10u1.  This update also fixes a regression for some
older 32-bit PCs (bug #1017425), and enables the i10nm_edac driver
(bug #1019248).  It additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 5.10.137-5.10.149 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.
