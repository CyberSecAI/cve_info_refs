Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content is directly related to the commit that addresses the vulnerability. The commit message "Hide user data in group permissions get user API" and the code changes clearly indicate a fix for a vulnerability related to exposing user data. While the specific CVE ID isn't mentioned, the context strongly suggests that this commit is related to CVE-2022-3422

**2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability was that the `findUsers` function in `group_permissions.service.ts` was returning more user data than intended. Specifically it returned fields such as `default_organization_id` which should not be returned.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability was information disclosure.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who could access the group permissions API could potentially obtain sensitive user information, including email addresses, first names, last names, and default organization IDs, of users associated with specific group permissions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector would involve making API requests to the `findUsers` endpoint associated with group permissions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be authenticated and authorized to access the group permissions API.

**3. Specific Details:**

*   **Code Changes:** The commit includes a change in the `group_permissions.service.ts` file, modifying the `findUsers` function. The original code fetched user information using a query that selected all user fields, and this has been updated to specifically select `users.id`, `users.firstName`, `users.lastName`, and `users.email`.
*   **Test Case Update:** The commit also includes a change in the test file `group_permissions.e2e-spec.ts` to reflect the changes in the returned user data. It now only checks for the presence of id, email, first\_name, and last\_name. This validates that the fix was implemented correctly.

**Summary:**

The provided content reveals a vulnerability in the `group permissions` API that exposed more user data than necessary. This information disclosure issue was resolved by modifying the query to retrieve only the required fields. The commit also contains relevant test cases that validate the fix.
