Debian Bug     : 1022806 1024697

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-3759

    It was discovered that the memory cgroup controller did not
    account for kernel memory allocated for IPC objects.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3169

    It was discovered that the NVMe host driver did not prevent a
    concurrent reset and subsystem reset.  A local user with access to
    an NVMe device could use this to cause a denial of service (device
    disconnect or crash).

CVE-2022-3435

    Gwangun Jung reported a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding subsystem
    which would lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could possibly
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-3521

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the KCM subsystem
    which could lead to a crash.

    This subsystem is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3524

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the IPv6 stack which
    could lead to a memory leak.  A local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3564

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3565

    A flaw was discovered in the mISDN driver which would lead to a
    use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-3594

    Andrew Gaul reported that the r8152 Ethernet driver would log
    excessive numbers of messages in response to network errors.  A
    remote attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3628

    Dokyung Song, Jisoo Jang, and Minsuk Kang reported a potential
    heap-based buffer overflow in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi driver.  A user
    able to connect a malicious USB device could exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3640

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3643 (XSA-423)

    A flaw was discovered in the Xen network backend driver that would
    result in it generating malformed packet buffers.  If these
    packets were forwarded to certain other network devices, a Xen
    guest could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    device reset).

CVE-2022-4139

    A flaw was discovered in the i915 graphics driver.  On gen12 "Xe"
    GPUs it failed to flush TLBs when necessary, resulting in GPU
    programs retaining access to freed memory.  A local user with
    access to the GPU could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information, cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or likely for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4378

    Kyle Zeng found a flaw in procfs that would cause a stack-based
    buffer overflow.  A local user permitted to write to a sysctl
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41849

    A race condition was discovered in the smscufx graphics driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A user able to remove the
    physical device while also accessing its device node could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41850

    A race condition was discovered in the hid-roccat input driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user able to access
    such a device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329 (XSA-424)

    Yang Yingliang reported that the Xen network backend driver did
    not use the proper function to free packet buffers in one case,
    which could lead to a deadlock.  A Xen guest could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2022-42895

    TamÃ¡s Koczka reported a flaw in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem
    that would result in reading uninitialised memory.  A nearby
    attacker able to make a Bluetooth connection could exploit
    this to leak sensitive information.

CVE-2022-42896

    TamÃ¡s Koczka reported flaws in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem that
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A nearby attacker able to make a
    Bluetooth SMP connection could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2022-47518, CVE-2022-47519, CVE-2022-47521

    Several flaws were discovered in the wilc1000 Wi-Fi driver which
    could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.  A nearby attacker
    could exploit these for denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2022-47520

    A flaw was discovered in the wilc1000 Wi-Fi driver which could
    lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability over such a Wi-Fi device could exploit
    this for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.158-2~deb10u1.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 423 v2 (CVE-2022-3643) - Guests can trigger
 NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-3643 / XSA-423
                              version 2

    Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Patch updated.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in
a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets.

It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network
stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear
section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case.

This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II
BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well.

In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will
forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core,
resulting in said misbehavior.

IMPACT
======

An unprivileged guest can cause network Denial of Service (DoS) of the
host by sending network packets to the backend causing the related
physical NIC to reset, abort, or crash.

Data corruption or privilege escalation seem unlikely but have not been
ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems using a Linux based network backend with kernel 3.19 and
newer are vulnerable. Systems using other network backends are not
known to be vulnerable.

Systems using Cisco (enic driver) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780
(bnx2x driver) NICs for guest network access are known to be vulnerable.
Systems using other NICs for guest network access cannot be ruled out
to be vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Using another PV network backend (e.g. the qemu based "qnic" backend)
will mitigate the problem.

Using a dedicated network driver domain per guest will mitigate the
problem.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This issue was discussed in public already.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

    filesystem images could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4378

    Kyle Zeng found a flaw in procfs that would cause a stack-based
    buffer overflow.  A local user permitted to write to a sysctl
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-20369

    A flaw was found in the v4l2-mem2mem media driver that would lead
    to an out-of-bounds write.  A local user with access to such a
    device could exploit this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-29901

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel
    processors (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against
    speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in
    some circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code
    execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

CVE-2022-40768

    "hdthky" reported that the stex SCSI adapter driver did not fully
    initialise a structure that is copied to user-space.  A local user
    with access to such a device could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information.

CVE-2022-41849

    A race condition was discovered in the smscufx graphics driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A user able to remove the
    physical device while also accessing its device node could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41850

    A race condition was discovered in the hid-roccat input driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user able to access
    such a device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329 (XSA-424)

    Yang Yingliang reported that the Xen network backend driver did
    not use the proper function to free packet buffers in one case,
    which could lead to a deadlock.  A Xen guest could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2022-42895

    TamÃ¡s Koczka reported a flaw in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem
    that would result in reading uninitialised memory.  A nearby
    attacker able to make a Bluetooth connection could exploit
    this to leak sensitive information.

CVE-2022-42896

    TamÃ¡s Koczka reported flaws in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem that
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A nearby attacker able to make a
    Bluetooth SMP connection could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2022-43750

    The syzbot tool found that the USB monitor (usbmon) driver allowed
    user-space programs to overwrite the driver's data structures.  A
    local user permitted to access a USB monitor device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  However, by default only the
    root user can access such devices.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.269-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
