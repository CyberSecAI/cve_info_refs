- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, leading to potential malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code via the plugin's settings page (specifically the "Login With Google Button Styles" field).
  - The XSS payload is triggered when a user logs into the WordPress account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress site.
  - The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the settings of the "Google Apps Login" plugin.
