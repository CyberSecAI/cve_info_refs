- Root cause of vulnerability: Incorrect error handling of base64 encoding in RRDP snapshot and delta files.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Failure to handle invalid base64 encoded data in RRDP files, leading to a fatal error and program termination.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service by causing Routinator to exit, thus preventing the distribution of RPKI data used for route origin validation.
- Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted RRDP snapshot or delta files with invalid base64 encoding, which, when processed by Routinator, cause it to crash.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious RRDP snapshot or delta file to Routinator.
