The CVE number for this vulnerability is CVE-2022-3029.
== Summary
Recent versions of Routinator contain a problem that causes Routinator to
exit if it encounters invalid data in RRDP snapshot or delta files.
== Affected products
Routinator 0.9.0 up to and including 0.11.2.
== Description
Due to a mistake in error handling, data in RRDP snapshot and delta files
that isnât correctly base 64 encoded is treated as a fatal error and causes
Routinator to exit.
Worst case impact of this vulnerability is denial of service for the RPKI
data that Routinator provides to routers. This may stop your network from
validating route origins based on RPKI data. This vulnerability does not
allow an attacker to manipulate RPKI data. We are not aware of exploitation
of this vulnerability at this point in time.
Starting with release 0.11.3, Routinator handles encoding errors by rejecting
the snapshot or delta file and continuing with validation. In case of an
invalid delta file, it will try using the snapshot instead. If a snapshot file
is invalid, the update of the repository will fail and an update through rsync
is attempted.
== Solution
Install Routinator 0.11.3 or later.
