The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in versions up to, and including, 6.8 via the ‘file’ parameter which can be manipulated during user avatar deletion. This makes it possible with attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply paths to arbitrary files on the server that will subsequently be deleted. This can be used to delete the wp-config.php file that can allow an attacker to configure the site and achieve remote code execution.

**Recommended Remediation:** Update to version 6.8.1, or newer patched version.

**Publication Date:** 2022-11-29

The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘sforum\_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]’ cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.

## SVG Support 2.5  – 2.5.1 – Insecure Plugin Defaults to Cross-Site Scripting

**Affected Plugin:** [SVG Support](https://wordpress.org/plugins/svg-support/)

**Plugin Slug:** svg-support

**Affected Versions:** 2.5 – 2.5.1

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2022-4022](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4022)

**CVSS Score:** 6.4 (Medium)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Researcher/s:** Marco Wotschka

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.5.2

**Recommended Remediation:** Update to version 2.5.2, or newer patched version.

**Publication Date:** 2022-11-16

The SVG Support plugin for WordPress defaults to insecure settings in version 2.5 and 2.5.1. SVG files containing malicious javascript are not sanitized. While version 2.5 adds the ability to sanitize image as they are uploaded, the plugin defaults to disable sanitization and does not restrict SVG upload to only administrators. This allows authenticated attackers, with author-level privileges and higher, to upload malicious SVG files that can be embedded in posts and pages by higher privileged users. Additionally, the embedded JavaScript is also triggered on visiting the image URL, which allows an attacker to execute malicious code in browsers visiting that URL.

**Plugin Slug:** transposh-translation-filter-for-wordpress

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.0.8.1

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2022-2536](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2536)

**Researcher/s:** Julien Ahrens

**Fully Patched Version:** Unpatched.

**Recommended Remediation:** Uninstall plugin from site until patched version available.

**Publication Date:** 2022-11-14

The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized setting changes by unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient validation of settings on the ‘tp\_translation’ AJAX action which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any restrictions and influence the data shown on the site. Please note this is a separate issue from CVE-2022-2461. Notes from the researcher: When installed Transposh comes with a set of pre-configured options, one of these is the “Who can translate” setting under the “Settings” tab. However, this option is largely ignored, if Transposh has enabled its “autotranslate” feature (it’s enabled by default) and the HTTP POST parameter “sr0” is larger than 0. This is caused by a faulty validation in “wp/transposh\_db.php.”

If an attacker can successfully upload a php file then remote code execution via inclusion may also be possible. Note: for users with less than administrative capabilities, /wp-admin access needs to be enabled for that user in order for this to be exploitable by those users.

   @Daniele,

   Seems like your first issue is to find a good solution to accept stripe payments. You can try our following free Stripe payments plugin to see if that one works for you to accept payment via Stripe.

   <https://wordpress.org/plugins/stripe-payments/>

   If you think it will work, you can then later add the affiliate plugin to the site (which will add the affiliate commission capability). That stripe payments plugin has an integration with this affiliate plugin. So that can be added at a later time.

   Pre-sales questions:

   Hi, Iâ€™m looking for a solution that:

   1) let my visitors do a paid subscription through Stripe.

   2) when the visitors subscribe, an affiliate id could be saved on their profile for further consultation.

   3) the customers can be able to update the details of their cards in the future.

   4) an email can automatically be sent to the subscriber (and to the affiliate, if any) in case in a given month the payment fails.

   Can I achieve that with your plugin? Could you share some documentation that can help me to achieve what I want?

   Cheers,

   Daniele

   @Kim, you send the payment manually at a regular interval (for example: 2 weeks after the month ends). You can review the commissions before you payout.

   Does this plugin also pay the commissions to the affiliate? If they use their link to purchase an item in the shop, the affiliate gets their commission in their account, is it automatically put into their paypal account or do I have to send the payments manually?

   @Henk, This plugin is for users who are selling products from their own site and want some affiliates to promote their products.

    I am a publisher and a lot of merchants ask me if they can have their products on my website. I run a WooCommerce website and I have no idea how to do that? It’s clear that this plugin is meant for merchants that want to push their products to affiliates or can this plugin also work the other way around so that I can publish products of external merchants if they offer me clear product feeds, and how would that work? thanks a lot 🙂

    @Vespa, Yes you can have different affiliate commissions for specific affiliates. However you will need to go in and manually change their commission rate.

That notification of a sale in the morning is the best feeling ever. My sales have gone up since I added this plugin as I am getting more referral traffic.
