## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Slickr Flickr <= 2.8.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Open the plugin and intercept the request using burpsuite.
Give the below payload in the parameter "flickr\_id" and submit the request.
xss"/><script>prompt(2)</script>//xss
The stored XSS will be triggered whenever the user visits the page.
