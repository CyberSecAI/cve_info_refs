{
  "CVE-2022-3707": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A double-free flaw exists in the Linux kernel's Intel GVT-g graphics driver. Specifically, when the `intel_gvt_dma_map_guest_page` function fails during the `split_2MB_gtt_entry` operation, the `ppgtt_invalidate_spt` function is called, which frees the spt. However, the caller function `ppgtt_populate_spt_by_guest_entry` is not aware of this and attempts to free the spt again in its error handling path.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Double-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can trigger a double-free condition, leading to a system crash or other undefined behavior.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by inducing a failure in the intel_gvt_dma_map_guest_page function, often through high system resource usage, like high DMA load.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a local user with the ability to trigger high resource consumption and interact with the Intel GVT-g graphics driver."
