        "vulnerability_details": {
          "root_cause": "The `kref_init` function, which initializes the reference counter, was called too late in `em28xx_usb_probe`. This was because `em28xx_init_dev` invokes initialization functions that call `kref_get` before `kref_init` is called, leading to a refcount bug.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "Incorrect initialization order of the reference counter using kref."
          ],
          "impact": "The commit message indicates that a refcount bug was triggered in the syzkaller instance.",
           "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the device probing process when the `em28xx_usb_probe` function is called. It is triggered when the `kref_get` is called on an uninitialized reference counter.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would likely need to have control over or influence the device probing sequence."

            "Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18 are susceptible to vulnerabilities."
