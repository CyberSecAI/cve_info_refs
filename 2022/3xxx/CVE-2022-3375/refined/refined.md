```json
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the `push_options_handler_service.rb` does not check if a user has access to a target project's repository before checking if a target branch exists.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "Inadequate access control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can enumerate the branch names of a private or restricted project if they have access to a fork of the project.",
    "attack_vectors": "By using Git push options (specifically `merge_request.target`), an attacker can query for existence of specific branches in the victim's project.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a fork of the victim's private project. No other special capabilities or privileges are needed beyond the ability to push to their own fork."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is in `app/services/merge_requests/push_options_handler_service.rb:67`. The vulnerable code is `if push_options[:target] && !target_project.repository.branch_exists?(push_options[:target])`."
