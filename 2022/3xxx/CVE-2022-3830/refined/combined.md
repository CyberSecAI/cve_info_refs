## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Page Builder <= 1.2.8 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Navigate to Setting » add the payload: "><img src=x onerror=confirm(document.domain)>, into "Content Width & Gutter" to trigger the popup.
