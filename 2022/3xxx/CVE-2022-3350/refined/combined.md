## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Contact Bank <= 3.0.30 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Form settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a form and put the following payload in the Description: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
The XSS will be triggered in Manage Forms dashboard as well as in page/post where the form is embed (and there is at least one field in the form)
