  "CVE-2022-3189": {
    "description": "A specially crafted PHP script could use parameters from a HTTP request to create a URL capable of changing the host parameter. The changed host parameter in the HTTP could point to another host that will send a request to the host or IP specified in the changed host parameter.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a PHP script that uses HTTP request parameters to construct URLs without proper sanitization, allowing modification of the host parameter.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can manipulate the host parameter to make requests to arbitrary internal or external hosts, potentially leading to information disclosure or other attacks.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable PHP script.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker is capable of sending crafted HTTP requests."
