- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient policy verification by the WARP iOS client when handling the "Disable WARP" quick action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The WARP iOS client failed to properly verify the "Lock WARP switch" policy, allowing users to bypass the lock via a quick action.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Bypassing the "Lock WARP switch" feature, which is meant to prevent users from disabling the WARP client on enrolled devices. This compromises the enforcement of the Zero Trust policy.
- **Attack vectors:** Using the "Disable WARP" quick action on iOS devices running vulnerable versions of the WARP client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with access to a device where the "Lock WARP switch" policy is enabled and running an affected version of the WARP iOS client.
