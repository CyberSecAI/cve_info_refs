The provided content relates to CVE-2022-3846.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Workreap theme's notification feature allows unauthorized access to other users' notifications due to the notification ID being easily guessable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The vulnerability stems from the fact that notification IDs are sequential or predictable, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary notifications by manipulating the `id` parameter in the request.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read any user's notifications, which might contain sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/testt/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `workreap_read_notification` and manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only needs to be logged in as a subscriber or higher. The attacker can then brute-force the notification ID to view other users' notifications.
