## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Fancier Author Box by ThematoSoup <= 1.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Open the setting page of this plugin.
2. There are many input boxes on the setting page to set the color.
3. Enter the following value in these input boxes on the setting page to get the XSS trigger. The value is: 123" onmouseenter=alert(/XSS/) ".
