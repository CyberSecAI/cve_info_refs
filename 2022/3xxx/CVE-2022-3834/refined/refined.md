- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape certain settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user such as an admin. The malicious payload is injected into the input boxes of the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have admin privileges to access the plugin's settings and inject the malicious payload.
