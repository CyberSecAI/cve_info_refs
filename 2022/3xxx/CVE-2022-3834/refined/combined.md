## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Google Forms <= 0.95 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Click the 'Add New Google Form' button on the plugin home page.
2. Enter the following payload in the input boxes: 123" onmouseenter=alert(/XSS/) ", and click the Publish button on the right side of the page.
3. Go back to the main page or refresh the page and move the mouse to the input box on this page to trigger the XSS.
