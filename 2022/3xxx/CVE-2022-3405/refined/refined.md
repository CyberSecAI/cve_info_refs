```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Acronis Cyber Protect appliance allows anonymous registration of new backup/protection agents on new endpoints. This API endpoint also generates bearer tokens which the agent uses to authenticate to the appliance. The management web console runs on the same port as the API for the agents, this bearer token is also valid for any actions on the web console.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Authentication Bypass (CWE-305)",
    "Insufficient scope of bearer tokens"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with network access can register a new agent, obtain a bearer token and manipulate settings on the appliance via the web console. This leads to arbitrary command execution on the agents and the appliance, resulting in a complete compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the Acronis Cyber Protect appliance.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the appliance is required to send API requests to register a new agent and obtain a bearer token."
