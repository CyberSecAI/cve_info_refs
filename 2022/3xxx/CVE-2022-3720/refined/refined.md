- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape parameters before using them in SQL statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors:**  By sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=awl_event_monster&page=em-visitors-page` with the `action` set to `deleteallvisitor` and a malicious `id` value (e.g., `1 OR 1=1`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access (or higher) to the WordPress site.
