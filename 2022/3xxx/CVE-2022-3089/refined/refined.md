Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the EnOcean SmartServer v2.2 SR8/SP8 (4.12.006) with i.LON Vision v2.2 SR8/SP8 (4.12.006). These credentials, which are stored in cleartext, can be accessed by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials**: The software stores sensitive credentials in a file in cleartext rather than using a more secure storage and retrieval method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If an attacker gains access to the file containing the credentials, they could use them to:
  - Control the web user interface.
  - Control the file transfer protocol (FTP) server.
- This could result in unauthorized access, manipulation, and/or denial of service of the SmartServer device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local access (AV:L). An attacker must have some level of access to the system where the affected software is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker needs to be able to access the file system on the device running the affected software in order to obtain the cleartext credentials.
- **High Privileges (PR:H):** The attacker likely needs some sort of privileged access on the local system in order to access the file containing the credentials.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
- A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been assigned, with the vector string: AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H.
- EnOcean Edge has released SmartServer 3.5 Update 2 (v3.52.003) to address the vulnerability. Users are encouraged to update.
- A hardening guide is available from EnOcean for further security enhancements.
