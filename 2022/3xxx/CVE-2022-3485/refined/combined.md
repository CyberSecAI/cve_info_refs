[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3485)

---

#### Impact

An unathenticated attacker can remotely reset the administrator password.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

* The certificate is renewed by adjusting the hostname to an own customer-specific, so it does not contain the serial number.

**Remediation**

The password-reset mechanism will be updated in a future version.

When using automation components, make sure that no unauthorized access can take place. In addition, measures should be taken to ensure that the components do not have direct access to Internet resources and that they cannot be accessed from insecure networks. Use available security measures such as authentication and authorization groups.
