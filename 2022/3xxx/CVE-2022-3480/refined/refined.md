Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-3480:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper resource management, specifically the absence of limits or throttling on incoming HTTPS connections to the management interface. This allows an attacker to overwhelm the device with connection requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-770:** Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling. The device does not properly limit the number of incoming HTTPS connections, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By sending a large number of unauthenticated HTTPS connection requests, an attacker can render the HTTPS management interface of the affected devices unresponsive, preventing legitimate administrators from accessing and managing the devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The attack is launched by sending HTTPS requests to the target device's management interface.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to initiate the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to generate a large number of HTTPS connection requests:**  The attacker needs the capability to send a large number of requests from different source IPs.

**Additional Details:**
- Firewall limits for incoming connections are ineffective at preventing the issue.
- The vulnerability affects multiple models of PHOENIX CONTACT FL MGUARD and TC MGUARD devices running firmware versions prior to 8.9.0.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by restricting access to the HTTPS management interface to trusted networks.
- The vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 8.9.0 and later.
