## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EU Cookie Law <= 3.1.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Enter the setting page of this plugin.
2. In the input boxes named "Disable Cookie Text", "Background Color", and "Font Color", enter the following value in all the input boxes. The value is: 123" onmouseenter=alert(/XSS/) "
3. Click the 'Save Changes' button on the page.
4. Refresh or re-enter the page and move the mouse over the input box to trigger the XSS.
