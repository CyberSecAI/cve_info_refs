[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3270)

---

#### Impact

Please consult the CVE details above.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

Update of technical user manual documentation in next product version.

> Additionally, please refer to the following Recommendations
>
> Users running communication over an untrusted network who require full protection should switch to an alternative solution such as running the communication over a VPN.
>
> Festo strongly recommends to minimize and protect network access to connected devices with state of the art techniques and processes. For a secure operation follow the recommendations in the product manuals and note the protocols and their supported features in Festo Field Device Tool or Festo Automation Suite online help.
>
> As part of a security strategy, Festo recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits: - Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside
>
> - Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
>
> - Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
>
> - Activate and apply user management and password features
>
> - Use encrypted communication links
>
> - Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
>
> - Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
