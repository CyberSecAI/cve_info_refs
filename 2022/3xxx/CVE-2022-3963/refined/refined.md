The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, specifically for the file `bbs/faq.php`. The commit message `[KVE-2022-0981] 그누보드 Reflected XSS 취약점` indicates this commit is related to a Reflected XSS vulnerability. The commit adds a sanitization step to prevent this vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper sanitization/encoding of the `$fm_id` parameter before it's included in the HTML output, specifically in the `qstr` variable which is likely used in URL parameters. This allows a malicious user to inject JavaScript code through this parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload in the `fm_id` parameter, an attacker can induce a user to click the link. The user's browser will then execute the injected code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click it. The attacker doesn't need any specific access or permissions on the server.

The vulnerability is addressed by casting the `$fm_id` to an integer: `$fm_id = (int) $fm_id;`
