- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings input fields, which are not sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (Admin+) on the WordPress site to access and modify the plugin's settings. This vulnerability can be triggered even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, making it exploitable in multisite setups where unfiltered HTML usage is often restricted for non-super admins.
