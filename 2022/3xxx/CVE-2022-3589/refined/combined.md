#### Published

2022-11-21 10:00 (CET)

#### Last update

#### Vendor(s)

Miele & Cie KG

#### Product(s)

| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | appWash by Miele | = All Versions |

#### Summary

Up until October 5th, 2022 the ease2pay API used by Miele's "AppWash" MobileApp was vulnerable to an authorization bypass. A low privileged, remote attacker would have been able to gain read and partial write access to other users data by modifying a small part of a HTTP request sent to the API. Reading or changing the password of another user was not possible, thus no impact to Availability.

#### Summary

An API Endpoint used by Miele's "AppWash" MobileApp in all versions was vulnerable to an authorization bypass.

---

#### Impact

The evaluation of the log files by ease2pay did not show any sign of actual exploitation of the vulnerability, extraction of data or misuse.

#### Solution

The ease2pay cloud service used by appWash was fixed on 05.10.2022. The tokens used for session authentication were changed to a secure state of the art solution. All affected tokens have been invalidated and new tokens were issued.

Therefore, no actions have to be taken by the users.

#### Reported by

CERT@VDE coordinated with Miele.

Miele would like to thank Bishoy Roufael for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.
