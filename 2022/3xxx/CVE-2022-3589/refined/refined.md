- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authorization bypass vulnerability existed in the ease2pay API used by Miele's "AppWash" mobile app due to insufficient validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key (CWE-639). The API endpoint was vulnerable to an authorization bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low-privileged, remote attacker could gain read and partial write access to other users' data by manipulating an HTTP request sent to the API. However, reading or changing another user's password was not possible.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a small part of an HTTP request sent to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.
