## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Spacer < 3.0.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escapes some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example, in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Add new Spacers and add payload "><h1 onclick=alert(document.domain)>Gem</h1> to Settings » Spacer » Add Spacers » New Spacer » Space Title and submit.

### Affects Plugins
