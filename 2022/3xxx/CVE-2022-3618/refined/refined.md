- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** High-privilege users (like admin) can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker with administrative privileges can add malicious JavaScript code via the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin-level privileges on the WordPress site. They need to be able to access the plugin settings page and add new spacers.
