Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit, which relates to CVE-2022-3376:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of a check to prevent users from setting their new password to be the same as their old password. This could potentially allow an attacker, who might have already learned the old password, to simply "change" it to the same value, maintaining access without a true password change.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient password change validation:** The application did not enforce a policy requiring the new password to be different from the old one. This allowed users to bypass the intended password change mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Maintained Access:** If an attacker gains knowledge of a user's current password, they could effectively "change" it to the same value, and thus would not be locked out of the account via the user being forced to change their password. This allows the attacker to maintain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the user interface where a user would change their password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to know the current password of the targeted user.
- The attacker must be an authorized user of the system to access the password change functionality.

**Additional Details (from code diffs):**

The provided code diffs demonstrate the fix, adding a validation check in `rdiffweb/controller/page_pref_general.py` within the `validate_new` method, which now throws an error if the new password is the same as the current one:

```python
def validate_new(self, field):
    """
    Make sure new password if not equals to old password.
    """
    if self.new.data and self.new.data == self.current.data:
        raise ValueError(_('The new password must be different from the current password.'))
```

This change, along with related tests in `rdiffweb/controller/tests/test_page_prefs_general.py`, effectively closes the vulnerability. The test code also includes a test case specifically for this scenario:

```python
def test_change_password_with_same_value(self):
    # Given a user with a password
    self._set_password(self.PASSWORD, "pr3j5Dwi", "pr3j5Dwi")
    self.assertStatus(303)
    # When updating the pasword with the same password
    self._set_password("pr3j5Dwi", "pr3j5Dwi", "pr3j5Dwi")
    self.assertStatus(200)
    # Then an error should be displayed
    self.assertInBody("The new password must be different from the current password.")
```

The commit also includes an entry to the README.md file describing this change:
