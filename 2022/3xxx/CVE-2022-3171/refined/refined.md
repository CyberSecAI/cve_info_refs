Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-3171:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the parsing procedure for binary and text format data within `protobuf-java` and its related implementations. Specifically, when input streams contain multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated or unknown fields, the objects are repeatedly converted between mutable and immutable forms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is inefficient handling of embedded messages leading to excessive object conversions, causing long garbage collection pauses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit results in a Denial of Service (DoS). The excessive garbage collection pauses caused by the vulnerability can severely impact the availability of applications using the affected protobuf libraries, effectively making them unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves supplying a specifically crafted input to a service parsing protobuf data. This input is designed to trigger the excessive object conversions, causing long garbage collection pauses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send crafted protobuf messages to a vulnerable server or application. The attacker requires the ability to manipulate the protobuf message's structure, creating the conditions necessary to trigger the garbage collection issue. The attack vector is considered "adjacent" which indicates it does not necessarily need to be a direct remote access, but could involve an adjacent network or system. The attack complexity is low, and it does not require any user interaction. It does require low privileges.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects not only the Java core and lite Protobuf runtimes but also Protobuf for Kotlin and JRuby, which rely on the Java Protobuf runtime.
- The vulnerability is triggered by input data and the specific structures within the protobuf message
- Patched versions include 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6, and 3.16.3 for the Java and related libraries, and similar versions for the Ruby gem.
- The fix affects both the Java runtime (full and lite) and the generated code. So if you have generated code checked in somewhere, you'll need to regenerate it using the new version.
- Gentoo marks the severity as "low", even though the CVSS score is 5.7 (Medium).
