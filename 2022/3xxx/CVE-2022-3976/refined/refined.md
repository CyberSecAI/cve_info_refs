The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3976.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the MMS file services of the libiec61850 library. This occurs due to insufficient validation of filenames provided by a remote client, allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability
- Insufficient input validation for file names provided by a remote client

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Access arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially containing sensitive information.
- Delete or modify existing files outside of the intended directory.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a remote client sending MMS file service requests with maliciously crafted filenames to an affected server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to establish a connection to the affected MMS server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send MMS file service requests, such as file open, delete, rename, and obtain file.
- The attacker must be able to craft malicious file names including "../" or "./" in the file path.
