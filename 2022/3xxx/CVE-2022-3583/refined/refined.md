{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The website application does not verify the validity of the data submitted by the user to the server (type, length, business parameter validity, etc.), and does not effectively filter the data input by the user with special characters. User-provided input is directly used in the database query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the 'username' parameter of login.php.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially bypass authentication, access sensitive data, and execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to login.php with malicious SQL code in the 'username' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
