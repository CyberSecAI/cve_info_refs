Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3573:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper filtering of query parameters in the `wiki changes` page within GitLab. Specifically, the `params_with_whitespace` function utilizes `request.query_parameters` instead of `safe_params` when generating a link to toggle whitespace changes in diffs. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary parameters into the link.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting parameters like `protocol` and `host` with malicious values (e.g., `javascript:` URLs), an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser.
- **User Impersonation:** This enables attackers to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, potentially leading to account takeover or data manipulation.
- **Confidentiality and Integrity Impact:** The impact on confidentiality and integrity is rated as high because an attacker can perform arbitrary actions as the user. Availability is rated as none, as account takeover doesn't directly impact availability of the service itself.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack can be performed over the network (internet).
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the injected parameters, directing the victim to the vulnerable `wiki changes` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs to have the ability to create a project and a wiki page.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, specifically, the user needs to click on the "Hide whitespace changes" link which is generated with attacker-controlled parameters.
- **Self-Hosted GitLab Instance Without Strict CSP:** The vulnerability is directly exploitable in self-hosted GitLab instances that do not enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP). While a CSP can prevent direct execution of injected JavaScript, the vulnerability is still present.

**Additional details:**
- The report includes a video demonstration of the XSS vulnerability in action.
- The vulnerability affects the `app/views/projects/diffs/_diffs.html.haml` file and the `diff_helper.rb` file.
- The fix involves using `safe_params` to filter the parameters instead of using `request.query_parameters` directly.
