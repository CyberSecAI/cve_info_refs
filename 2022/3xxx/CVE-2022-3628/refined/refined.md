- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An intra-object buffer overflow occurs in the `brcmf_fweh_event_worker()` function within the Broadcom brcmfmac driver. This happens when the device provides a `bsscfgidx` value that is equal to or greater than the size of the `brcmf_if` array, which is defined as `BRCMF_MAX_IFS` (16).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code lacks a proper check to validate the `bsscfgidx` value against the array bounds before using it as an index. This leads to an out-of-bounds access.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can cause a kernel panic and a system crash due to the out-of-bounds access, which triggers a general protection fault and a KASAN error. It can also lead to potential memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious or compromised wireless device sending a crafted event with an invalid `bsscfgidx` value to the driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to send wireless packets to the vulnerable system, likely as a connected or nearby client. They also need to be able to control the `bsscfgidx` parameter within the messages sent to trigger the vulnerability.
