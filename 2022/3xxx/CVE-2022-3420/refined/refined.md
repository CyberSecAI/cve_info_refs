Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Official Integration for Billingo" fails to properly sanitize and escape user-controlled input within its settings. Specifically, the "Gomb szöveg" (Button text) field under WooCommerce > Settings > Billingo > E-mail Beállítások is vulnerable.

*   **Weakness:** The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because the plugin does not sanitize user input before storing it in the database and later displaying it on the page.

*  **Impact:** A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the website. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting a malicious JavaScript payload within the vulnerable field. Once saved, the payload is stored in the database and executed when that field is displayed on a page in the administrative dashboard.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a user account with high privileges, at least with a role of "Shop Manager" in WordPress
    *  The attacker must be able to access the WooCommerce settings pages, specifically the Billingo settings.

*   **More details than CVE description**: Yes, the provided content provides more detail than the generic CVE description by outlining the specific vulnerable field within the plugin's settings, a proof-of-concept payload, and the specific user roles required to exploit the vulnerability.
