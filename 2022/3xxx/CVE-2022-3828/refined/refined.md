- The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings.
- When a user accesses the plugin's settings page and hovers their mouse over the vulnerable input box, the malicious script will execute.

- The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the plugin's settings.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled (e.g. in multisite environments).
- The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 3.4 (Low), primarily due to the requirement for high privileges.
