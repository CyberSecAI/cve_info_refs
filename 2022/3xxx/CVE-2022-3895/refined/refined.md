Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of output in some UI elements of the Common user interface component.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The UI elements are not properly sanitizing output, allowing arbitrary HTML to be injected.
* **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the UI, potentially leading to various impacts such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Phishing attempts
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Information theft
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the UI elements of the Common user interface that process user-provided input without proper sanitization.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply input to vulnerable UI elements. This could be through various means depending on the specific element.

**Affected versions:**

*   BlueSpice 4.x
*   Common User Interface 3.0.x

**Fixed versions:**

*   BlueSpice 4.2.1
*   Common User Interface 3.0.5
