- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of database entries, or even complete database compromise. The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality impact.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible via the submission page of the plugin's admin interface, specifically when performing bulk delete actions on submissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a high privilege user (Admin+) to access the vulnerable functionality. They also need to capture and modify a specific request, replacing the Submission ID with an SQLi payload.
