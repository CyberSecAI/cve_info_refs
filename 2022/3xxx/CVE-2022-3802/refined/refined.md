Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `database.go` file where the `where` parameter from a user-controlled input is directly concatenated into an SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `where` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Spoof Identity:** Attackers can potentially bypass authentication or authorization checks by manipulating query results.
- **Tamper with Existing Data:** Malicious SQL queries could modify or corrupt stored data.
- **Complete Data Disclosure:** The vulnerability could allow attackers to access and extract all data within the system's database.
- **Data Destruction/Unavailability:** SQL injection may enable an attacker to destroy or render data unavailable.
- **Database Server Takeover:** In some scenarios, it could lead to the attacker gaining control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:**  The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/api/v2/open/rowsInfo` endpoint.
- **`where` Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is the `where` parameter within the POST request, where malicious SQL code is injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs some familiarity with SQL syntax to craft malicious injection payloads.
- **No prior authentication**: The API endpoint `/api/v2/open/rowsInfo` is open, meaning no authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `go-ibax` starting from commits on July 18, 2020.
- The specific vulnerable code is located at line 189 of `packages/api/database.go`.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates the injection by using `pg_sleep` to induce a time delay on the database server, verifying the injection.
- The issue was resolved by removing the vulnerable code, as stated in the commit message `Fixed #2060, #2061, #2062, #2063`.
