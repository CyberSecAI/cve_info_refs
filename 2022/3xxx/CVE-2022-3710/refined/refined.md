Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-3710:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* A post-authentication, read-only SQL injection vulnerability exists in the API controller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*  SQL Injection: Specifically, the vulnerability allows for read-only access to the database, suggesting the injection occurs in a read context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* An attacker can read non-sensitive configuration database contents. It's important to note that the impact is described as read-only, meaning attackers can't modify the database.

**Attack vectors:**
* The vulnerability is located in the API controller, meaning attackers would likely exploit it via API calls.
*  Authentication is required before exploitation, indicating the attacker must have valid API credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*  Authenticated access: The attacker needs to be an authenticated API client.
*  Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint and parameters is required to craft the SQL injection attack.
