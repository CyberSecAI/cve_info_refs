Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Donation Thermometer plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied settings, specifically within the "Currency settings". This lack of sanitization allows malicious HTML and JavaScript code to be stored.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize input leading to malicious script injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of users who access the plugin's settings page or any page where the `[thermometer]` shortcode is used. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker needs to be a high-privileged user such as an administrator to modify the plugin's settings. The malicious payload is injected into the "Currency settings" field via the plugin's admin interface. The XSS is triggered when the settings page is re-accessed or on pages where the shortcode is used.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have administrative access to the WordPress site to modify the plugin settings.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the Donation Thermometer plugin prior to 2.1.3.
*   The provided proof of concept uses the following payload:  `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` which demonstrates how to trigger the XSS.
*   The CVSS score is 3.4 (low), indicating a low severity. However, the impact of XSS can vary depending on the context and the attacker's objective.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-3128.
