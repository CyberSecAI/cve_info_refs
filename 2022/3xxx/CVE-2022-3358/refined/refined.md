**2. NetApp Product Security Pages (security.netapp.com_dde267f1_20250114_210241.html, security.netapp.com_3cf4a1eb_20250115_184632.html, security.netapp.com_eaf46361_20250115_184637.html, security.netapp.com_3c97cd24_20250115_184637.html):**

*  **CVE Relevance:** These documents relate to CVE-2022-3358. They also provides information about NetApp products affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The NetApp advisory states that "OpenSSL versions 3.0 prior to 3.0.5 are susceptible to a vulnerability." It also mentions that successful exploitation could lead to "disclosure of sensitive information."
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  OpenSSL is vulnerable and could lead to disclosure of sensitive information if exploited
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Disclosure of sensitive information
*  **Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector indicates a network based attack with no required privileges or user interaction.
*    **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The CVSS vector indicates a remote attacker.
*   **Additional details:**
    *   Identifies specific NetApp products affected by CVE-2022-3358 (FAS/AFF BMCs, NetApp Cloud Backup OST Plug-in, NetApp HCI BMCs).
    *   Provides links to download updated firmware for affected products.
    *   Specifies products that are NOT affected.
    *   Mentions public discussion of the vulnerability.
    *   Provides a CVSS v3.1 vector and score (7.5/HIGH).
    *   States that there is no workaround available.
    *   It is an interim advisory and subject to change.
    *   It also provides a revision history of the document indicating the product status changes over time.

**3. OpenSSL Security Advisory (www.openssl.org_989a6478_20250114_210242.html):**

*   **CVE Relevance**: This is the official advisory from OpenSSL about CVE-2022-3358.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** "OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() and EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() functions." This leads to the functions trying to fetch an equivalent cipher from providers, rather than using the custom cipher directly. Passing "NID\_undef" to `EVP_CIPHER_meth_new()` will cause the NULL cipher to be used, resulting in no encryption.
*    **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect handling of legacy custom ciphers and use of NULL cipher.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** "Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext."
*    **Attack vectors:** The advisory does not specify the attack vector but it implies that the application has to call the affected functions using a custom cipher with `NID_undef`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have control over the application that calls the affected OpenSSL functions. It notes that applications that only use SSL/TLS are not affected.
*   **Additional details:**
    *   The advisory classifies this as a "Low" severity vulnerability.
    *   Recommends upgrading to OpenSSL 3.0.6.
    *   States that OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.
    *   Provides a URL for the security advisory.

**Summary of Key Information about CVE-2022-3358**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in OpenSSL 3.0.0-3.0.5, where custom ciphers using `NID_undef` are incorrectly handled, resulting in NULL encryption.
*   **Vulnerability:** The use of legacy custom ciphers with "NID\_undef" causes a mismatch of cipher and the selection of the NULL cipher.
*   **Impact:**  Plaintext is transmitted without encryption, resulting in information disclosure.
*    **Attack Vectors:** An attacker must control an application that uses the affected functions with a custom cipher and `NID_undef`.
*   **Affected Versions:** OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5.
*   **Affected Products:** NetApp products incorporating the vulnerable OpenSSL versions. Specific affected products includes FAS/AFF BMCs, NetApp Cloud Backup OST Plug-in, NetApp HCI BMCs.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.6 (or the NetApp provided firmware updates for affected products) to patch this flaw. There are no known workarounds at this time.
