Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3115:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the return value of `kzalloc()` in the `malidp_crtc_reset` function within the Linux kernel's DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem, specifically related to the Mali-DP display driver.
*   `kzalloc()` is used to allocate memory for the `state` variable. If the memory allocation fails (returns NULL), the code proceeds to dereference `state->base` without verifying if state is valid, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. If `kzalloc()` fails, `state` will be NULL, and the code attempts to access `state->base`, which causes the dereference of a null pointer and a crash or undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic/Crash:** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a kernel panic or crash due to the NULL pointer dereference. This can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel graphics driver (DRM) for Mali-DP display controllers. To trigger the vulnerability, the system would likely need to be using the Mali-DP display driver, and the vulnerable code path in `malidp_crtc_reset` needs to be executed with a condition that causes `kzalloc` to fail, such as a memory exhaustion scenario.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to trigger the execution of the `malidp_crtc_reset` function in a way that causes `kzalloc` to fail to allocate memory. The attacker needs to have the ability to affect memory availability or influence the system to trigger the vulnerable path within the Mali-DP display driver. The specific capabilities needed will depend on how the driver is used and configured within the system.
*   The provided information indicates that this vulnerability affects ARM architectures since the driver is located under `drivers/gpu/drm/arm`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves checking if `state` is NULL before dereferencing it. If `state` is NULL, it passes NULL to `__drm_atomic_helper_crtc_reset`, avoiding the null pointer dereference.
* The bug report also notes that the vulnerability is fixed in kernel version 5.19-rc1
