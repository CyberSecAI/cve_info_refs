- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue was present in the Mobile Device Service, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by a logic flaw that allows an application to delete files it does not have permission to access, which is a privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete files they do not have permission to access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, as the attacker must have the ability to run an application on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to run an application on the target Windows system and be able to exploit the logic flaw within the Mobile Device Service.
