Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication check in the `SecureTransferFiles` functionality of the Open Automation Software (OAS) Platform. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system if they can send properly formatted requests to the OAS Platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The core issue is the lack of proper authentication for the `SecureTransferFiles` command. Although a Security Group with File Transfer permissions and a User Account in that group is required within the OAS Platform, these can be created, or existing credentials can be sniffed off the network, enabling unauthorized access.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The vulnerability permits an attacker to read files from any location accessible by the user under which the `oas-engine` service operates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary file read, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, and other confidential data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Requests:** The attack involves sending a series of specially-crafted network requests to the OAS Platform's configuration port (default TCP/58727).
- **Credential Sniffing:** If valid Security Group and User Account credentials already exist, these can be sniffed off the network and used to authenticate the malicious request.
- **Account Creation:** If valid credentials don't exist they must be created via network requests before an attack can be performed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system running the OAS Platform.
- **OAS Platform Knowledge:** The attacker needs a good understanding of the OAS platform's configuration message format in order to craft the malicious requests.
- **Credentials (Either Sniffed or Created):** The attacker must either sniff existing OAS platform user credentials from the network, or they must create them by interacting with the OAS platform first.

**Additional Information:**
- The service runs as the `oasuser` which has normal user permissions.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a `SecureTransferFiles` command with a file path.
- The response from a successful request includes the contents of the requested file.
