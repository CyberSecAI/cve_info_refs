# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1492

## Open Automation Software Platform Engine SecureTransferFiles information disclosure vulnerability

##### May 25, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26067

### Summary

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the OAS Engine SecureTransferFiles functionality of Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112. A specially-crafted series of network requests can lead to arbitrary file read. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112

### Product URLs

OAS Platform - <https://openautomationsoftware.com/knowledge-base/getting-started-with-oas/>

### CVSSv3 Score

4.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-306 - Missing Authentication for Critical Function

### Details

The OAS Platform was built to facilitate the simplified transfer of data between various proprietary devices and applications. It can be used to connect products from multiple different vendors, connect a product to a custom application, and more.

By sending a series of properly-formatted configuration messages to the OAS Platform, it is possible to read an arbitrary file at any location permissible by the underlying user. By default these messages can be sent to TCP/58727 and, if successful, will be processed by the user `oasuser` with normal user permissions.

Before the transfer of a file will be accepted, it is necessary that a Security Group with File Transfer permissions and a User Account in that group exist. Both the Security Group and the User Account referred to here are elements within the OAS Platform, not on the underlying Linux machine. If an acceptable Security Group and User Account already exist, the necessary credentials can be sniffed off the network and used for the transfer. If they do not exist, they would need to be created before exploitation would be possible.

A valid `SecureTransferFiles` command resembles the following:

```

```

Once the required Security Group and User Account have been created, a file of choice can be read from the underlying linux machine at any path permissible by the user owning the `oas-engine` service, through use of the `SecureTransferFiles` command accompanied with the newly created (or sniffed) credentials. When a `SecureTransferFiles` command is successfully processed, the response will contain the contents of the requested file. This response resembles the following:

```
### Mitigation

The easiest way to mitigate attempts to exploit this vulnerability is to prevent access to the configuration port (TCP/58727 by default) when not actively configuring the OAS Platform. Additionally, use a dedicated user account to run the OAS Platform and ensure that user account does not have any more permissions than absolutely necessary.
