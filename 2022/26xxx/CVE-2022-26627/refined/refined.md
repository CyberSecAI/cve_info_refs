Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) stemming from a chain of three issues:
1. **Insecure Permission Check:** The application lacks proper permission checks when using an arbitrary file write function.
2. **Arbitrary File Write Function:**  The application allows arbitrary file writes with some limitations (specifically, ".html" extension).
3. **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application loads error pages (with the ".html" extension) using an "include" mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Authorization:** Lack of authorization checks on file write functionality.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Ability to write arbitrary content to files with a specific extension.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** Inclusion of local files based on user-controlled parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **File Upload:** Attackers can leverage the insecure file upload/write function to write a malicious webshell payload to a server file (e.g., `404.html`).
2.  **Local File Inclusion Trigger:** By triggering the error page (e.g., accessing a non-existent URL), they can execute the payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have the ability to upload/write files to the server through the exposed vulnerable application.
*   The attacker must also be able to trigger the inclusion of the modified file.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerable application is identified as "PTMS".
*   The application is written in PHP 7.2.24.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by overwriting the error handling page (404.html) with a web shell payload.
