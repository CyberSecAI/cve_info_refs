Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Datalist table module in Joget DX 7 not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before displaying it in a data table. Specifically, it fails to escape Javascript data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. This means malicious scripts are stored on the server (in this case, through user-submitted data) and executed when a user views the affected table.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Malicious script execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary Javascript or HTML on a victim's web browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **User-submitted data:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts via a form or other input field that populates the vulnerable data table.
*   **Datalist table:** The vulnerable component is the datalist table module which does not perform input sanitization/escaping.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to submit data:** The attacker needs to be able to submit data to a form that is displayed on the Datalist table of a Joget DX 7 application.
*   **No special privileges required**: The exploit can be achieved without requiring any elevated permissions, since it is triggered by a user interacting with a table.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided PoC involves injecting an XSS payload within a link tag (`<a href="javascript:x='%27-alert(1)-%27';">XSS</a>`). When clicked, this would trigger the javascript and demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability exists because the application displays collected data without properly escaping or sanitizing it.
*   The vulnerability is in Joget DX 7 and can be exploited remotely.
