    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the SAMLResponse parameter of HTTP requests.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a user's browser session. This could lead to various consequences, including but not limited to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious payload within the SAMLResponse parameter of an HTTP request. This could occur through a manipulated link or a crafted HTTP request.",
          "The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses and renders the crafted SAMLResponse, without proper sanitization, resulting in the execution of the injected script in the victimâ€™s browser."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request with a specially crafted SAMLResponse parameter. This could potentially be achieved through various means, such as social engineering (e.g. phishing), or by controlling a system involved in the SAML authentication process."
