Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-26181.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow was discovered in the `aligned_dealloc` function in `src/lepton/bitops.cc` at line 108. This is triggered when the `reset_buffers` function at `src/lepton/jpgcoder.cc:4373` is called, which occurs during image processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `aligned_dealloc` function attempts to free memory that is not allocated, causing a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to memory corruption as indicated by the AddressSanitizer report, potentially allowing a denial-of-service. It is possible that it could lead to further exploitation although this is not described in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted JPEG file.
- The vulnerable code is part of the lepton image compression tool when deallocating memory during image processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious JPEG file as input to the lepton tool. This suggests a local or remote attack, depending on how the lepton tool is deployed (e.g., command-line processing of user-provided files or as part of a server application).

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified and reported by Asteriska001.
- A Proof-of-Concept (POC) file was provided to trigger the vulnerability.
- The issue was fixed in pull request #155.
- The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) report clearly shows the heap-buffer-overflow occurring in `aligned_dealloc` function.
- The issue was observed in lepton version v1.0-1.2.1-185-g2a08b77.
