```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability exists in the res_stir_shaken module when processing downloaded files. The module fails to validate if the downloaded file is a certificate as expected, and it doesn't check the size of the file, making it possible to download very large files.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Resource exhaustion vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause resource exhaustion by downloading large, unexpected files.
- Attack vectors: Remote, unauthenticated access by exploiting the STIR/SHAKEN functionality to download large files.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker does not require authentication and can initiate the download of large files remotely.
