### **[fCorleone](/fCorleone)** commented [Mar 1, 2022](#issue-1155193215)

| **Describe the bug** I start a chain with 4 nodes, one of the nodes is a malicious one. It will change the value of some fields of a message. After starting the group, I started the stress testing program. And the program stuck. The log shows that the nodes stop producing new blocks and keep view changing.  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Start a chain with 4 nodes; 2. Start the stress testing program; 3. The error occurs   **Expected behavior** Nodes produce the blocks normally.  **Screenshots** The stress testing program stuck here (2% of the transactions are received) [wecom-temp-2116cfbcd90990732c059a3c3ed262b3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22519865/156157229-3f03a637-215e-4806-9695-190555532b49.png)  **Environment (please complete the following information):**   * OS: Ubuntu 20.04 * FISCO BCOS Version 3.0.0-rc2 (master branch)   **Additional context** The log files: [nodes\_logs\_0301.zip](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/files/8161037/nodes_logs_0301.zip) |

| There is a bug in the logic of PBFT 3.0 fastViewChange, which causes if a malicious node deliberately sends a viewchange packet with a large view, other nodes will frequently trigger fast view switching and try to catch up with the malicious node's view |
