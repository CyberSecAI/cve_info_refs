{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation in the file download function. The `$url` parameter, which is controlled by the user, is not filtered before being used in file manipulation functions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file read vulnerability due to lack of input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like database configuration files.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `index/download/index` endpoint, using the `url` parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint with a manipulated `url` parameter."
