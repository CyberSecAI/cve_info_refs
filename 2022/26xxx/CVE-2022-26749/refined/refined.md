- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application can exploit the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious application on the target macOS system.
