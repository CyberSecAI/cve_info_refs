- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the wifi driver, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs system execution privileges. User interaction is not required for exploitation.
