Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-26651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `func_odbc` module of Asterisk.
*   Some databases use backslashes to escape specific characters, including backticks.
*   If user-provided input containing backslashes is passed to `func_odbc`, the module might construct a faulty SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The `func_odbc` module does not properly handle backslashes in user-provided input when constructing SQL queries.
*   **SQL Injection (Potential):** While not definitively reproduced, the advisory highlights the potential for SQL injection and database manipulation through the vulnerability. Specifically the advisory is published to cover the case of SQL injection with the aim of database manipulation by an outside party.
*   **Broken SQL Queries:** Input with backslashes can lead to the generation of broken SQL queries that fail.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Manipulation:** Exploitation could lead to unauthorized modification of the database.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The advisory mentions potential information disclosure and arbitrary code execution in the Debian security advisory, though those are not specified for CVE-2022-26651 specifically.
*   **Denial of Service:** Malformed SQL queries could cause database errors, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Sessions:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely without requiring authentication.
*   **Malicious Input:** Attackers can inject malicious input containing backslashes into parameters handled by the `func_odbc` module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to interact with the Asterisk server and pass user-provided input to the vulnerable `func_odbc` module.
*   No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory recommends escaping backslashes using a new dialplan function `SQL_ESC_BACKSLASHES` within the `func_odbc` module or disabling backslash escaping in the database.
*   Affected versions: Asterisk Open Source 16.x, 18.x, and 19.x and Certified Asterisk 16.x (all versions)
*   Corrected in: Asterisk Open Source 16.25.2, 18.11.2, 19.3.2 and Certified Asterisk 16.8-cert14.
