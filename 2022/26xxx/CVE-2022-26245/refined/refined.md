Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `falcon-plus/modules/nodata/config/service/host.go` file. Specifically, the `GetHostsFromGroup` function directly incorporates user-provided input (`grpName`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the injection vulnerability. The `grpName` parameter, which is obtained from the URL path, is directly embedded into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize the input `grpName` before using it in the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access and Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, view sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attack vector is through an HTTP request to `/proc/group/` endpoint, where the attacker can inject SQL code via the `grpName` parameter in the URL path, i.e., `/proc/group/<malicious_grpName>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the existence of the /proc/group/ endpoint.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet from `falcon-plus/modules/nodata/config/service/host.go` is:

    ```go
    func GetHostsFromGroup(grpName string) map[string]int {
        // ...
        q := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT host.id, host.hostname FROM grp_host AS gh "+
            " INNER JOIN host ON host.id=gh.host_id AND (host.maintain_begin > %d OR host.maintain_end < %d)"+
            " INNER JOIN grp ON grp.id=gh.grp_id AND grp.grp_name='%s'", now, now, grpName)
        // ...
    }
    ```
*   The `grpName` variable is taken directly from the URL path and is used in a SQL query using `fmt.Sprintf`, without any sanitization.
