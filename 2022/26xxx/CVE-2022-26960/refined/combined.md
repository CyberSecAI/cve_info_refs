### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

[security:[CVE-2022-26960](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7q88-jxvp-9gp2 "CVE-2022-26960")] fix a path traversal issue

Fixed a paste traversal vulnerability. The problem was getting out of
the configured directory and allowing the hosting server's file system
to read and write "arbitrary" files.

Special thanks to Gaetan Ferry (Synacktiv) for reporting this issue.

Our previous article laid the groundwork for understanding the ADB protocol and its usage scenarios. It primarily focused on the TCP/IP communication between the ADB Client and the ADB Server. However, this still required at this point an intermediate server to bridge our client and the Android device.
In this article, we'll dive into the message protocol between ADB Server and adbd, with the goal of improving our Rust client library with capacity to fully interact with a device, eliminating the need for system dependency installatio...

Kerberos authentication relay was once thought to be impossible, but multiple researchers have since proven otherwise. In a 2021 article, James Forshaw discussed a technique for relaying Kerberos over SMB using a clever trick. This topic has recently resurfaced, and in this article, we aim to provide additional insights from the original research and introduce an implementation using krbrelayx.

In October 2024, during the Pwn2Own event in Cork, Ireland, hackers attempted to exploit various hardware devices such as printers, routers, smartphones, home automation systems, NAS devices, security cameras, and more. This blog post highlights a challenging vulnerability that was patched just before the competition. Although it was fixed in time, it deserved more attention than simply being discarded.

Bitwarden is a popular password managing software. Being open-source, it offers self-hosting capabilities with ease of use in a controlled office or home environment. Attackers might prioritize targeting this application given the secrets it usually stores. In this article, we will deep dive into the internals of Bitwarden, how it stores encrypted data, and what information is available to whomever controls the server.

In the landscape of software development, leveraging open-source libraries and packages through registries like NPM, PyPI, Go modules, and Crates for Rust has become standard practice. This approach facilitates the rapid integration of diverse functionalities into applications, driving both innovation and efficiency across the development community. While the benefits of using these resources are clear, the management of external dependencies introduces a set of considerations regarding security and maintainability.

For those having experience working on Android devices, you may already be familiar with a useful tool called adb. This tool is invaluable for debugging, offering a unified way to execute shell commands, transfer files, install APKs, and much more. In this first blogpost, we will explore its underlying protocol between client and server and introduce a Rust crate called adb\_client implementing it.

## [Using Veeam metadata for efficient extraction of Backup artefacts (2/3)](publications/using-veeam-metadata-for-efficient-extraction-of-backup-artefacts-23)

*30/08/2024*
CSIRT

In a previous blogpost, we explored Veeam Backup & Replication's "backup chain metadata" files and how to parse them in a comprehensive Velociraptor artifact. In this article, we complement our findings with metadata embedded directly in VBR's Storage files. Then, we create a Velociraptor pipeline to remotely access relevant forensic artefacts in backed up data. This aims to enable DFIR analysts to extend the time horizon in their investigations using Veeam backups and Velociraptor, while minimizing network bandwidth usage and extensi...

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

We recently identified a path traversal issue in the elFinder software. It is assigned CVE identifier CVE-2022-26960. While the vulnerability is pretty classical, the story of its discovery is not. Keep on reading for the details.

elFinder has a long story of being affected by severe issues. Here, at Synacktiv, we already took part in that story when, in 2019, Thomas Chauchefoin disclosed a command injection affecting that productÂ [[1]](elfinder-the-story-of-a-repwning#references).

It is therefore with great pleasure that we face this product during our engagements. And, sometimes, vulnerabilities are on our way.

# The situation

A few months ago, during regular intrusion tests of ours, a fuzz of the root of our target application raised an interesting result (thank the world for raft wordlists).

```

000017052:   301        9 L      28 W       321 Ch      "elfinder"

```

Reaching the discovered directory led to a shinyÂ *elFinder*Â deployment. A few \*click click\* later the penalty strikes: version is 2.1.12.Â **AGES**Â old! (2016).

![version is 2.1.12](../sites/default/files/inline-images/elFinder_version.png)

A 5 years old version!

The issue we (Thomas) found in 2019 affected all versions prior to 2.1.48. Our instance should therefore be affected, and we should be close to a remote code execution. However, if you read the advisory forÂ [CVE-2019-9194](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9194)Â you might notice a subtle detail:

> The implementation of $volume->resize() can be found in elFinder/php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php and will perform various operations to ensure that resizing was not explicitly disabled,

In our case, the resize feature was disabled, preventing the exploitation. However, with such an old version, one could expect other issues to be available. And, indeed, multiple ones exist.

[CVE-2018-9109](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9109), for example, is a path traversal that allows reading arbitrary files. But it also deletes them, which was not that great on our production environment.

Then, you haveÂ [CVE-2021-32682](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32682)Â andÂ [CVE-2021-23394](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23394)Â discovered at SonarSource, and by Thomas Chauchefoin againÂ [[2]](elfinder-the-story-of-a-repwning#references). If you have not read this post yet, I invite you to do so. The TL;DR is a list of interesting vulnerabilities with critical impacts:

* File deletion
* File move
* PHP file upload (to remote code execution)
* Argument injection in the zip CLI (to remote code execution)
* Race condition (to remote code execution)

The fact is, our target, if not good with software updates, had a top-notch server hardening:

* No write permissions in the web root
* Disabled PHP handler in the elFinder upload directory
* Minimum deployment (no zip CLI)

We got ourselves without an easy go-to exploit.

**Note:**

If you ever doubt investing in hardening is necessary, this proves you wrong.

# Pwning anyway

What happened next is an insane scam, a vulnerability robbery, an unexpected stroke of luck.

## Back to elFinder features

If you are not familiar with the software we are talking about, you only need to know it is nothing more than a file manager for the web. It as features like uploading and downloading files, zipping things, previewing doohickeys and so on.

For that, it exposes a single server entry point, named the connector, with a JSON like API. All API calls include aÂ `cmd`Â parameter, with the action to perform, and often one or moreÂ `target`Â arguments representing the files to manipulate.

TheÂ `target`Â parameter is of the formÂ `source_path`, whereÂ `source`Â is the storage in which the file is, andÂ `path`Â the base64 encoded path of the file in the storage. We'll ignore the source part in our case study as it won't play any role. Just consider our source is always the file system root directory.

```

GET /elfinder/php/connector.minimal.php?cmd=file&target=l1_YWFhLnR4dA&download=1&reqid=17fbb7e3da0cd HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.122.113
[...]

```

For example, in the previous request, theÂ `file`Â action (AKA download) is called on theÂ *aaa.txt*Â file. Relative paths are taken from the configured exposed directory.

## And then back to business

Let's imagine we are in 2010 working on a software that has not been extensively reviewed. Let's say we face a software that handles file paths. To finish, imagine we want to test for path traversal issues. The first instinctive action would be to provide the application with a longÂ *../*Â chain and to try reachingÂ */etc/passwd*Â that way.

If that does not work we would probably try some bypasses, adding a few slashes, encoding on key characters and so on.

But this should not succeed in our case right? Not on a 6 years old version. Not on a software that has been thoroughly reviewed by talented people.

The fact is we tried.

![exploit_passed](../sites/default/files/inline-images/Unexpected_etc_passwd.png)

Wait, WHAT!?

The fact is it passed.

# Emotional rollercoaster

## Down the rabbit hole

We found ourselves in a situation where we had an unexpected vulnerability, and no idea about why it is here and went unnoticed for such a long time. However, if we analyze our payload, what appears is that the application is probably messing up looking forÂ *../*Â and trying to delete them. This is often seen in beginner CTF web challenges.

Building upon our luck, let's grep for *".."*.

```

$ find . -name "*.php" -exec grep -HF ".." {} \;
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:    * System Root path (Unix like: '/', Windows: '\', 'C:\' or 'D:\'...)
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:                           $name = preg_replace('/^(.*?)(\..*)?$/', '$1_'.$files[$name]++.'$2', $name);
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:                           $name != '.' && $name != '..' && $this->rmTmb($this->stat($p));
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:           if (substr($path, 0, 3) === '..' . $separator) {
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:           // normalize `/../`
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:                                   if ($file === '.' || $file === '..') {
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:                           if ($file !== '.' && $file !== '..') {
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:                                                           if ($entry !== "." && $entry !== "..") {
./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php:    * Ususaly used for images, but can be realize for video etc...
./elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php:              if (count($info) < 9 || $info[8] == '.' || $info[8] == '..') {
./elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php:                      if (($comp != '..')
./elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php:                      || ($new_comps && (end($new_comps) == '..'))) {
./elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php:                      if ($name && $name !== '.' && $name !== '..' && substr(strtolower($info[0]), 0, 1) === 'd') {
./elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php:       * Ususaly used for images, but can be realize for video etc...
./elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php:                      if ($name !== '.' && $name !== '..' && (!$targets || isset($targets[$name]))) {
./elFinderVolumeFTP.class.php:              $excludes = array(".","..");
./elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php:                  if (($comp != '..')
./elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php:                  || ($new_comps && (end($new_comps) == '..'))) {
./elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php:   * Usualy used for images, but can be realize for video etc...
./elFinderVolumeDropbox.class.php:   * Ususaly used for images, but can be realize for video etc...
./elFinderVolumeMySQL.class.php:     * Usualy used for images, but can be realize for video etc...

```

There are not that many results. Even less if we suppose `elFinderVolumeFTP`, `elFinderVolumeDropbox` and `elFinderVolumeMySQL`Â probably have nothing to do with our issue. Among the results, a code comment might catch the eye:

> ./elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php: // normalize `/../`

Following that path leads to theÂ `getFullPath`Â function from theÂ `elFinderVolumeDriver`Â class. This abstract class implements common components that are used by what are calledÂ *drivers*Â that abstract the file operations for the different source types. We said we would only consider the local file system case, so let's not bother with that.

```

/**
    * Resolve relative / (Unix-like)absolute path
    *
    * @param string $path  target path
    * @param string $base  base path
    * @return string
    */
protected function getFullPath($path, $base) {
    [...]
    // normalize `/../`
    $normreg = '#('.$sepquoted.')[^'.$sepquoted.']+'.$sepquoted.'\.\.'.$sepquoted.'#'; // '#(/)[^\/]+/\.\./#'
    while(preg_match($normreg, $path)) {
        $path = preg_replace($normreg, '$1', $path, 1);
    }

    [...]

    return $path;
}
```

We skipped irrelevant parts of the function to get to the heart of the question, and to the pattern we were looking for. And what we see is actually a regex that is being used to "normalize `/../`". We could ask: hey, what could go wrong?, but we already know the answer.

Thanks to the code comments, we know that the pattern being looking for isÂ `#(/)[^\/]+/\.\./#`Â and all the matches are replaced with aÂ */*. This process is repeated until no match is found.

But this pattern is wrong. TheÂ `//../`Â sequence will never be matched, allowing the path traversal we highlighted.

Let's fire up the "go to reference" feature of our IDE to validate this function is part of the call chain for theÂ *file*Â action:

* Maj+F12: elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem::\_inpath
* Maj+F12: elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem::\_stat
* Maj+F12: elFinderVolumeDriver::stat
* Maj+F12: WOWOWOW

`elFinderVolumeDriver` calls theÂ `stat`Â method more than 50 times in tenth of functions, including one calledÂ `file`Â (the name of the action we called on the API). Most of those functions are controllers for actions which mean our issue might have a broader impact than just reading arbitrary files.

## Back to the future

At the time of our engagements, this discovery was enough to get RCE. Our target was running aÂ *Laravel*Â instance for which we leaked the cookie signing secret. You know the sequel.

The next question that arose was: is this issue still present in the latest release? That question was legitimate as about 50 minor versions were released since the one we tested against.

```

+        }

```

The diff between the 2.1.12 and the latest version speaks for itself. No significant change was made to the vulnerableÂ `getFullPath`Â function. Right before cracking open the champagne, we threw the exploit payload to a test deployment of the latest version.

![exploit does not pass](../sites/default/files/inline-images/Unexpected_no_etc_passwd.png)

Wait, WHAT!?

So our vulnerable function did not change. Yet, our exploit payload does not work anymore. Sure, another change in the software must prevent the directory traversal.

Among the vulnerabilities reported by SonarSourceÂ [[2]](elfinder-the-story-of-a-repwning#references), two actually are path traversal related. TheÂ `_joinPath`Â method of theÂ `elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem`Â was the root cause for this issue. It concatenated two paths without any checks and was patched the following way:

![the join path patch](../sites/default/files/inline-images/_joinpath_patch.png)

The patch for theÂ \_joinPathÂ function directory traversal

While the function was previously just returning a concatenation of two paths, without further validation or sanitation, the new version contains a few security measures. In particular, a call toÂ `realpath`Â might be responsible for our problems if it happens that theÂ `_joinPath`Â function is part of the call chain for theÂ *file*Â action.

* Maj+F12: Direct usages of this function are found in few controllers not related to the file action. AlsoÂ `elFinderVolumeLocaleFileSystem::_abspath`.
* Maj+F12:Â `elFinderVolumeDriver::abspathCE`
* Maj+F12:Â `elFinderVolumeDriver::decode`
* Maj+F12: pretty much everywhere

TheÂ `decode`Â method fromÂ `elFinderVolumeDriver`Â is actually the one that is used to decode theÂ *target*Â kind of arguments (AKA from a l1\_AAAA parameter, it extracts the actual file pointer). It is therefore called in most action controllers, including the one forÂ *file*Â calls. There is no way you can go around theÂ `decode`Â call.

However, if we go back down the call chain toÂ `_joinPath`Â and stop on theÂ `elFinderVolumeLocaleFileSystem::_abspath`, it appears it will not always call the doomedÂ `_joinPath`Â function.

```

protected function _abspath($path)
{
    if ($path === DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR) {
        return $this->root;
    } else {
        if (strpos($path, $this->systemRoot) === 0) {
            return $path;
        } else if (DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR !== '/' && preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z]:' . preg_quote(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, '/') . '/', $path)) {
            return $path;
        } else {
            return $this->_joinPath($this->root, $path);
        }
    }
}
```

In fact,Â `_joinPath`Â is only called when the path being queried is a relative path. Using an absolute path should then be enough to exploit the vulnerability on the latest version.

Of course, just throwing the absolute path toÂ */etc/passwd*Â at the application won't do the trick.

![no direct absolute path](../sites/default/files/inline-images/Nope_absolute_path.png)

Would have been to easy.

The answer to the question "what happens if the path is absolute?" is in fact in the call chain to theÂ `getFullPath`Â function. If you look back at it, you will see that the chain goes through a function namedÂ `_inpath`. This one is said to prevent directory traversal.

```

protected function _stat($path)
{
    $stat = array();

    if (!file_exists($path) && !is_link($path)) {
        return $stat;
    }

    //Verifies the given path is the root or is inside the root. Prevents directory traveral.
    if (!$this->_inpath($path, $this->root)) {
        return $stat;
    }
```

As it is explained in the comments, theÂ `_inpath`Â is used to validate that the requested path is inside the configured web root directory. Even if we know this part of the software fails at handlingÂ *dot dot slashes*Â there is no chance thatÂ */etc/passwd*Â is considered inside theÂ *root*. For that to happen, the provided path needs to start with the configured root path as a prefix.

Well, that's nothing like impossible. If we build a path that actually starts with that prefix, and exploit the double slash trick to inject unsanitizedÂ *../*Â sequences after it, we should be able to pass all the checks and sanitation.

![repwned](../sites/default/files/inline-images/Repwn.png)

Repwned!

# Wrapping up

If you got this far in the post, you probably know the issue is a path traversal vulnerability in theÂ *elFinder*Â software. The impact depends a lot on the context the thing is deployed in. At the very least, an arbitrary file read is possible. It can be sufficient to get remote code execution in some cases.

As we said earlier, the security function we bypassed is used in multiple action controllers. It should be able to call actions like:

* search
* upload
* parents
* subdirs

With correct permissions, this is equivalent to reading, writing and browsing the server's file system.

elFinder implements other controls, on file extensions in particular, that might prevent writing arbitrary PHP scripts or so. However, this is not necessary to get code execution on a host. You might just replaceÂ *authorized\_keys*Â files, crontabs, etc.

To finish, yes, exploiting this issue on the latest version requires knowing the file system path to theÂ *elFinder*Â root directory. This one might be guessed (/var/www/html? /srv/php?), brute forced, or leaked via another vulnerability. Left as an exercise for the reader.

This is not required on all versions before 2.1.59. But in those, you might as well exploit the RCE reported by Thomas from Sonar. Unless you are as lucky as we areâ¦
