Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient path sanitization within the `getFullPath` function in the `elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php` file. This function attempts to normalize path strings by removing `../` sequences, but it uses an incorrect regular expression which fails to handle sequences like `//../`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The core issue is a path traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended web root directory.
*   **Incorrect Regex:** The regular expression `#/([^\/]+)/\.\./#` used for path normalization does not correctly handle `//../` sequences, leading to path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server's filesystem.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can write or modify files on the server's filesystem.
*   **Arbitrary File Browse:** Attackers can browse directories on the server's filesystem.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some cases, the vulnerability can lead to RCE if the attacker can modify critical system files or upload malicious code (depending on server configuration and file permissions).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests to the `connector.minimal.php` endpoint, which is part of the elFinder API.
*   **Manipulation of `target` Parameter:** The attack manipulates the `target` parameter of the API call to inject the path traversal sequence.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the server hosting the vulnerable elFinder instance.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** Attackers must know the correct URL and how to make requests to the elFinder connector endpoint.
*  **Optional Knowledge of Root Path (for latest versions):** For versions after the patch of `_joinPath`, knowledge of the elFinder root path is needed to exploit the vulnerability by prepending it to the malicious path.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Vulnerable versions:** The vulnerability affects elFinder versions up to and including 2.1.60.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1.61.
*   **Synacktiv Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Synacktiv during a penetration test and was reported to the elFinder team.
*   **Bypass:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting sequences like `//../` into the path, which bypass the incorrect regex.
*   **Real world exploitability**: Even in a hardened environment, this vulnerability can be used to achieve RCE by overwriting files like `.ssh/authorized_keys` or crontabs.
*   **Call chain**: The `getFullPath` function is used in multiple actions such as file upload, browse, search. This means the vulnerability can be used to achieve arbitrary file read, write and browsing.
*   **`_abspath` function:** The `_abspath` function in `elFinderVolumeLocalFileSystem.class.php` is responsible for validating the absolute path. This patch can be bypassed using an absolute path starting with the configured `root` of elFinder followed by a malicious path using `//../` to achieve path traversal.
*   **SonarSource Findings:**  The content references path traversal vulnerabilities found by SonarSource ([CVE-2021-32682](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32682) and [CVE-2021-23394](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23394)), which were not present in the current target instance. These vulnerabilities are related to the `_joinPath` method and were patched by adding a `realpath` call.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, attack vectors, and attacker requirements. It also includes information about the discovery and fix of the vulnerability.
