The provided content relates to CVE-2022-26278.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `PowerSaveSet` function.
- The program uses `sscanf` to parse the `time` parameter without proper size validation, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: Input from the `time` parameter is directly copied to the stack without proper bounds checking during parsing by `sscanf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By overflowing the stack, an attacker can overwrite return addresses or other critical data, allowing them to execute arbitrary code and gain a root shell on the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/goform/PowerSaveSet` endpoint.
- The `time` parameter in the POST request is used to trigger the overflow.
- The attacker crafts a specific value for the `time` parameter to cause a buffer overflow during parsing by `sscanf`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This would typically involve being on the same local network as the router, or exploiting it remotely via a forwarded port.
- The attacker does not need authentication (although, in the provided example, the request does send a cookie containing a password).
