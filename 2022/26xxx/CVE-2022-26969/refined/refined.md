      "status": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default configuration for `CORS_ENABLED` and `CORS_ORIGIN` in versions prior to 9.7.0 were set to be overly permissive.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Defaults: The default CORS settings allowed cross-origin requests from any origin, potentially exposing the application to security risks.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack could result in unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, and other malicious activities due to the permissive CORS configuration.",
        "Attack vectors": "Network: The vulnerable component is accessible over the network and potentially from the entire internet.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not require any prior authorization or access to the system to exploit the vulnerability. However, some user interaction may be required for successful exploitation."
      },
      "extra_details": "The vulnerability is due to a configuration issue, not a code flaw. The fix involves setting secure defaults for CORS (disabling it by default) and requiring explicit configuration of allowed origins. The provided content indicates the previous defaults were set to make getting started as easy as possible which resulted in a security risk."
