```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `sap-theme` URL parameter in SAP Fiori launchpad allows specifying a custom theme name, which can include a path to a .css file. This input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, and redirection to arbitrary websites (Open Redirect), depending on the victim's privileges.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL containing the `sap-theme` parameter with an unsanitized path to a malicious CSS file that embeds HTML payload, an attacker can execute arbitrary HTML code within the context of the vulnerable page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious `sap-theme` parameter and trick a user into accessing it.
