# Onapsis Security Advisory 2022-0005: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
vulnerability in SAP Fiori launchpad

## Impact on Business

Impact depends on the victim's privileges. In most cases, a successful
attack
allows an attacker to hijack a session, or force the victim to perform
undesired
requests in the SAP System (CSRF) as well as redirected to arbitrary web
site
(Open Redirect).

## Advisory Information

- Public Release Date: 06/21/2022
- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2022-0005
- Researcher(s): Yvan Genuer

## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:
  - SAP\_UI 753
  - SAP\_UI 754
  - SAP\_UI 755
  - SAP\_UI 756
  - SAP\_BASIS 787

  (Check SAP Note 3149805 for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: CWE-79
- CVSS v3 score: 8.2 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N
- Risk Level: High
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2022-26101
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 3149805

## Affected Components Description

SAP Fiori launchpad is the entry point to ABAP platform for SAP Fiori apps
on
mobile and desktop devices.

## Vulnerability Details

During the navigation in SAP Fiori Launchpad, it is possible to provide a
custom
theme name using the url parameter ```sap-theme```. This parameter has an
option to provide the path to a .css file, which it is used directly in the
page
generation. This optional input is not sufficiently sanitized, allowing an
attacker to
control and craft any kind of html payload in the page requested.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 3149805 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3149805>.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
