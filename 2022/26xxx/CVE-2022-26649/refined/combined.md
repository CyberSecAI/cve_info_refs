SSA-310038: Multiple Vulnerabilities in SCALANCE X Switch Devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.6

2022-07-12

V1.1

SUMMARY

Several SCALANCE X switches contain multiple vulnerabilities. An unauthenticated attacker could reboot,
cause denial-of-service conditions and potentially impact the system by other means through heap and
buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products
where updates are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to port 80/tcp and port 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-26647

The webserver of affected devices calculates session ids and nonces in an insecure manner. This
could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to brute-force session ids and hijack existing sessions.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-26648

Affected devices do not properly validate the GET parameter XNo of incoming HTTP requests. This
could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash affected devices.
