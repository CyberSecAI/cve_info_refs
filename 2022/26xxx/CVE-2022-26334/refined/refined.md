- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices do not properly validate the GET parameter `XNo` of incoming HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation of the `XNo` parameter in HTTP GET requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the affected devices to crash, leading to a denial of service. The impact also includes potential low confidentiality and integrity impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network. An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious `XNo` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network segment as the targeted device and has to send malicious HTTP GET requests. Low privileges are required for the attack.
