{
  "CVE-2022-26613": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the 'category' parameter from the GET request is used in the query without any filtering.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete database information, bypass authentication, perform privilege escalation, or potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server. Sensitive data, including user credentials, could be accessed. The severity of the impact is dependent on the application's specific implementation and the database's configuration.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP GET requests. The attack vector is the 'category' parameter in the URL. For example `http://127.0.0.1/PHP-CMS/categorymenu.php?category=1`",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting a malicious URL containing SQL injection payloads within the 'category' parameter. No prior authentication or specific position is required."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PHP-CMS application uses unsanitized GET parameters directly in SQL queries without any filtering. This is found in `categorymenu.php`, `forgot.php`, `post.php`, and `search.php`.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities across different PHP files (`categorymenu.php`, `forgot.php`, `post.php`, and `search.php`). The absence of input sanitization and parameterization leaves the application open to various forms of SQL injection attacks.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can bypass security checks, extract data from the database, manipulate or delete records, potentially gain administrative access and could lead to complete system compromise. An attacker can also perform boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind and union query SQL injections.",
      "Attack vectors": "Attackers can inject malicious SQL commands using the category parameter, or any other vulnerable GET parameters of the mentioned apps.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with modified GET parameters to the affected files."
