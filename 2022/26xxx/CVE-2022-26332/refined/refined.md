Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Cipi Control Panel 3.1.15 does not properly sanitize user input when adding a new server through the "Server" panel. Specifically, the `name` parameter is vulnerable to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This malicious code will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected area of the application.
- This could lead to various malicious activities including:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the application.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's web interface.
- Specifically, the `name` parameter within a POST request to `/api/servers` is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cipi Control Panel.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "Server" panel in the Cipi Control Panel.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to add a new server.
