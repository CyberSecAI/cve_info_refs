{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `wlscan_ASP` function in the InRouter302 processes template tokens found in HTML pages by using values extracted from the nvram. Specifically, the function generates a command line using `iwpriv` and values for `wl0_iface` and `wl0_ap` extracted from the nvram. These values are not properly sanitized leading to command injection when passed to `popen`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "OS command injection (CWE-77)",
    "Improper neutralization of special elements in a command"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the InRouter302 device.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to a page containing the vulnerable template token `<% wlscan(); %>` after authenticating.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable page."
