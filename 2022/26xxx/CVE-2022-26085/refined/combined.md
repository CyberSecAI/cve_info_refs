# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1473

## InHand Networks InRouter302 httpd wlscan\_ASP OS command injection vulnerability

##### May 10, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26085

### Summary

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the httpd wlscan\_ASP functionality of InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.4. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.4

### Product URLs

InRouter302 - <https://www.inhandnetworks.com/products/inrouter300.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (‘Command Injection’)

### Details

The InRouter302 is an industrial LTE router. It features remote management functionalities and several security protection mechanism, such as: VPN technologies, firewall functionalities, authorization management and several other features.

The InRouter302 uses, inside its HTML pages, a minimal template language. The symbols between `<%` and `%>` are parsed server-side. For instance, the string `<% wlscan(); %>`, inside an HTML page, will call the httpd’s `wlscan_ASP` function. The output generated will be embedded in the original HTML page, replacing the template token.
The `wlscan_ASP`:

```
void wlscan_ASP(void)
{

      wl0_ap_ptr = (char *)nvram_safe_get("wl0_ap");                                                    [1]
      wl0_ap_value = atoi(wl0_ap_ptr);
      [...]
      wl0_iface_nvram_ptr = nvram_safe_get("wl0_iface");
      snprintf(wl0_iface,0xc,"%s",wl0_iface_nvram_ptr);                                                 [2]
      if (wl0_ap_value == 0) {
        stack_buf_ptr = stack_buf;
        wl0_iface_nvram_ptr = nvram_safe_get("wl0_ssid");
        strlcpy(stack_buf_ptr,wl0_iface_nvram_ptr,0x40);
        sprintf((char *)&command_line,"iwpriv %s connStatus",wl0_iface);                                [3]
        popen_res = popen((char *)&command_line,"r");                                                   [4]
      }

[...]
}

```

At `[2]` 0xc characters of the string `wl0_iface`, extracted from the nvram, are placed into a buffer. If the value of the `wl0_ap` variable, extracted at `[1]` from the nvram, is zero, then the code at `[4]` and `[5]` are reached. At `[4]`, the string `iwpriv <wl0_iface> connStatus` is generated. This string will then pass, at `[5]`, through `popen` to obtain the information of the `connStatus` private-command of the `<wl0_iface>`. As soon as one HTML page with the `<% wlscan(); %>` token is requested, by a logged-in user, the `wlscan_ASP` function will be reached.

Controlling `wl0_ap` and `wl0_iface` would lead to a command injection at `[4]`.
