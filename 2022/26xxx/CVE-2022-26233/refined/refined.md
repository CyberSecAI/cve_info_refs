Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application lacks proper input sanitization for URL inputs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- File Path Traversal (CWE-22): The application fails to restrict pathnames, allowing access to files and directories outside the intended scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read files and directories stored on the file system.
- This includes access to application source code, configuration files, and critical system files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application.
- The malicious request includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `..\..\`) to access files outside the intended directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates accessing the `hosts` file on a Windows system using a GET request with the path traversal payload: `GET /..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts HTTP/1.1`.
- This path traversal allows an attacker to navigate up the directory structure and then access the target file.
- The vulnerability is present in Barco Control Room Management Suite versions prior to 2.9 build 0275.
