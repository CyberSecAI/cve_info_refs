- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the Wi-Fi driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing bounds check that leads to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the vulnerability in the Wi-Fi driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: System execution privileges are needed, and user interaction is not required.
