So if you ever disliked some particular color JForum used, chances are you can now change it without even the need of a restart. - More control over image attachments from the Configurations page - Optimize Recent Topics and Hot Topics for large installations. *Large* meaning at least 100.000 posts before it will make a difference. - Fixed an issue where the last visited time on the forum home page was not actually reflecting that, but the time of the last session start - Switch optional Google Analytics integration from analytics.js to gtag.js - Fixed a CSRF vulnerability - As always, many dependencies haven been updated to the latest versions.   A full list of new features is at <https://sourceforge.net/p/jforum2/wiki2/NewFeatures281/>, upgrade instructions are at <https://sourceforge.net/p/jforum2/wiki2/UpgradingFrom280to281/> and you can download it from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/jforum2/files/>.

 JForum
 ![](/logo.jpg)

JForum (also known as *JForum2*) is a powerful forum software built as a Java web app. It is localized in numerous languages,
and only needs a Servlet 3.1 compatible servlet container running on Java 8, and one of a variety of databases to run on.
It is open source licensed under the BSD, and lives on SourceForge.

* **SourceForge**
  + [Home page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jforum2/)+ [Features](https://sourceforge.net/p/jforum2/wiki2/Features/)+ [Documentation](https://sourceforge.net/p/jforum2/wiki2/Documentation/)+ [Downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jforum2/files/)
          (The latest version is 2.8.3 from October 15, 2023.)+ [Source code in SVN](https://sourceforge.net/p/jforum2/code/HEAD/tree/)* [Support forum for questions, suggestions and problems](https://community.jforum.net/)
    + This is also the place for any contributions, especially bug reports and improvements of the various localizations,
      which are very welcome.* **Team**
      + JForum is maintained by [Andowson Chang](https://www.andowson.com/)
        and [Ulf Dittmer](https://www.ulfdittmer.com/).+ It was originally created, and maintained up to version 2.1.9, by Rafael Steil.* **Donations and gifts**

          or by sending a gift from an [Amazon Wish List](https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/2XQOXAFOX03TI).* **Services and custom development**
          + If you need assistance with JForum beyond what can be done in the public forum, or need some additional
            features that the open source version does not have, note that I provide professional services around JForum.
            Please [get in touch](https://www.ulfdittmer.com/images/email.jpg) to talk about your requirements.
