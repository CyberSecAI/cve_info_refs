Navigate to <http://hospital.com/admin-panel1.php> 2. Click 'Add Doctors ', use burpsuite to insert xss payload in the "special" parameter 3. Click "Add Doctors"   [Screenshot 2022-03-29 at 16 34 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35623498/160581913-8f121971-a568-419a-b378-865833fb2e58.png)  [Screenshot 2022-03-29 at 16 34 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35623498/160582014-d7108507-29be-479a-82ab-09dd4a78d391.png)  Proof of concept (Poc)： <script>alert(123)</script> |
