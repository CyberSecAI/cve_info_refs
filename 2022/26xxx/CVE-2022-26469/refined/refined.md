- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of externally controlled input to select classes or code, which is known as 'unsafe reflection'. Specifically, it involves fragment injection within the MtkEmail application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe reflection due to fragment injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege can occur.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is local and does not require user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the device. No additional execution privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
