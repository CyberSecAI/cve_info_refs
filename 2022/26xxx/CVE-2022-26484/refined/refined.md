Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-26484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause is an absolute path traversal vulnerability. The web server fails to sanitize input data, specifically resource names in GET requests. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files using absolute paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Absolute Path Traversal (CWE-36):** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to specify absolute file paths in HTTP GET requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, including sensitive information like application source code, configuration files, and critical system files. This could potentially lead to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the resource name in GET requests sent to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid account with administrative/root privileges to access the vulnerable web application.
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to send crafted requests to the vulnerable web server.

**Affected Versions**
* Veritas InfoScale Operations Manager (VIOM) Management Server and Managed Hosts/Agents 8.0, 7.4.2, 7.4, 7.3.1, 7.3, 7.2, 7.1, 7.0. Earlier unsupported versions may be affected as well.
