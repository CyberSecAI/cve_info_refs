The provided content describes a vulnerability report for multiple reflective XSS vulnerabilities in the `maccms10` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in multiple parameters across different admin pages, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Lack of input sanitization/validation
- Unsafe handling of user controlled data in multiple parameters (select, input, wd, repeat)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking by stealing administrator cookies
- Malicious code execution in the browser of the victim user
- Potentially lead to full compromise of the web application by leveraging the administrator account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted URLs with payloads in vulnerable parameters, which are then sent to the victim (e.g., an administrator)
- Victim clicks the link, triggering the XSS

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload
- Ability to send the crafted link to the victim
- Victim must be authenticated to the admin interface
- Victim must click the link

**Vulnerable parameters and locations**
The report specifically identifies the following vulnerable parameters:

- `/admin.php/admin/art/data.html`: `select`, `input`
- `/admin.php/admin/website/data.html`: `select`, `input`
- `/admin.php/admin/plog/index.html`: `wd`
- `/admin.php/admin/ulog/index.html`: `wd`
- `/admin.php/admin/vod/data.html`: `repeat`

The content provides a proof-of-concept payload and a detailed explanation for exploiting the vulnerability.
The report also contains mitigation advice:

1. HTML escape the input data so that it is not recognized as an executable script.
2. Filter the data according to the tags and attributes of the whitelist to clear the executable script (such as script tag, onerror attribute of img tag, etc.).
