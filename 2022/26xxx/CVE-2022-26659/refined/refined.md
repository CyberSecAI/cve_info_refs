    "content": "An arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in Docker Desktop Installer 4.5.1 that allows an unprivileged attacker to cause a denial of service via local system access.\nThe affected program tries to create/write install-log.txt in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Docker\\` directory with high integrity. The attacker could create a symlink with `install-log.txt` name that points to any arbitrary path (`CreatSymlink.exe %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Docker\\install-log.txt C://target_path/target_file.exe`). After the Docker Desktop Installer runs, the file will be created in the target path. If the target file already exists, the installer will overwrite the target file with its log data.\n",
