Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26068:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `Rest::Swagger` class in the Pistache library did not properly validate if the requested file was within the intended UI directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The lack of proper input validation allowed attackers to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files and directories outside of the intended UI directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers could read any file on the server's file system that the Pistache application had access to, potentially including sensitive information such as application source code, configuration files, and private keys.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain knowledge about the server's directory structure.
- The Snyk analysis indicates that there is a total loss of confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** Attackers could send a crafted HTTP request to the server with directory traversal sequences in the file path parameter, targeting the Swagger UI endpoint.
- The provided PoC uses `curl` to make such a request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication and can be exploited by unprivileged users.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was found and reported by Kirill Efimov and the Snyk Security Team.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #1065.
- The fix ensures that requested files are within the designated UI directory.
- The vulnerable versions are those prior to `0.0.3.20220425`.
