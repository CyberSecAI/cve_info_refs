```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection vulnerability is present due to the lack of sanitization of the 'id' parameter in the `view_product.php` file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use SQL injection to potentially access, modify, or delete data in the database, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'id' GET parameter in the `view_product.php` file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the 'id' parameter. No prior authentication is needed."
