- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability via Windows Registry settings for date fields on the Command Centre server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application uses Windows Registry settings for date fields which are vulnerable to SQL injection. It allows for arbitrary SQL queries preloaded into the registry to be executed by an attacker through the Visitor Management Kiosk.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the Visitor Management Kiosk, an application designed for public use.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the Visitor Management Kiosk and knowledge of how the Windows Registry settings and SQL queries work with the date fields in order to exploit the vulnerability. They would also need a high level of privilege on the Command Centre server.
