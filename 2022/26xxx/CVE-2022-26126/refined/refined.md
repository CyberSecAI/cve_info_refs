Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the misuse of the `strdup` function within the `isis_nb_notifications.c` file of the FRRouting (FRR) software. Specifically, `strdup` is used to duplicate a non-null-terminated binary string, which leads to a buffer overflow when the function attempts to read beyond the intended boundary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `strdup` function copies the content of the provided string until it encounters a null terminator. If the input `raw_pdu` lacks a null terminator, `strdup` will continue reading from memory until a null byte is found or the allocated buffer is exhausted, potentially overwriting adjacent stack data.
- **Incorrect Data Handling:** The code incorrectly treats binary data as a simple C-style string, leading to the misuse of `strdup`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, stack overflows can sometimes be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, although this may be difficult in practice with this particular vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Traffic:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted ISIS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) network packets that cause the `isis_notif_id_len_mismatch` function to be called with a `raw_pdu` that does not contain a null terminator.
- **Remote Exploitation:** An attacker can send malicious ISIS packets to a vulnerable FRR instance, thereby triggering the overflow remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker must have the ability to send network packets to a vulnerable FRR instance.
- **ISIS Protocol Knowledge:** An attacker would need to be able to craft or manipulate ISIS packets to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in `isisd/isis_nb_notifications.c`.
- The fix involves replacing the usage of `strdup` with a method to encode the binary data correctly, such as Base64 encoding, and creating a function `yang_data_new_binary` to handle the encoded data.
- The issue was reported by `whichbug` on GitHub and a fix was created and merged.
- There is discussion about whether this should be classified as a buffer overflow, as it triggers an assertion failure, but the root cause is a potential overflow.
