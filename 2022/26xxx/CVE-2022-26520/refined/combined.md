# Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability

Moderate

[davecramer](/davecramer)
published
GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8
Feb 15, 2022

## Package

maven

org.postgresql:postgresql
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 42.3.3

## Patched versions

42.3.3

## Description

### Overview

The connection properties for configuring a pgjdbc connection are not meant to be exposed to an unauthenticated attacker. While allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary connection properties could lead to a compromise of a system, that's a defect of an application that allows unauthenticated attackers that level of control.

It's not the job of the pgjdbc driver to decide whether a given log file location is acceptable. End user applications that use the pgjdbc driver must ensure that filenames are valid and restrict unauthenticated attackers from being able to supply arbitrary values. That's not specific to the pgjdbc driver either, it would be true for any library that can write to the application's local file system.

While we do not consider this a security issue with the driver, we have decided to remove the loggerFile and loggerLevel connection properties in the next release of the driver. Removal of those properties does not make exposing the JDBC URL or connection properties to an attacker safe and we continue to suggest that applications do not allow untrusted users to specify arbitrary connection properties. We are removing them to prevent misuse and their functionality can be delegated to java.util.logging.

If you identify an application that allows remote users to specify a complete JDBC URL or properties without validating it's contents, we encourage you to notify the application owner as that may be a security defect in that specific application.

### Impact

It is possible to specify an arbitrary filename in the loggerFileName connection parameter

"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test?user=test&password=test&loggerLevel=DEBUG&loggerFile=./blah.jsp&<%Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("i"));%>"

This creates a valid JSP file which could lead to a Remote Code Execution

### Patches

LoggerFile implementation has been removed and will be ignored by the driver, fixed in 42.3.3

### Workarounds

sanitize the inputs to the driver

Reported by Allan Lou v3ged0ge@gmail.com

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

No known CVE

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

Package        : libpgjava
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-13692 CVE-2022-21724 CVE-2022-26520
Debian Bug     : 962828

Several security vulnerabilities have been found in libpgjava, the official
PostgreSQL JDBC Driver.

CVE-2020-13692

    An XML External Entity (XXE) weakness was found in PostgreSQL JDBC.

CVE-2022-21724

    The JDBC driver did not verify if certain classes implemented the expected
    interface before instantiating the class. This can lead to code execution
    loaded via arbitrary classes.

CVE-2022-26520

    An attacker (who controls the jdbc URL or properties) can call
    java.util.logging.FileHandler to write to arbitrary files through the
    loggerFile and loggerLevel connection properties.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 42.2.5-2+deb10u1.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 42.2.15-1+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpgjava packages.

For the detailed security status of libpgjava please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libpgjava>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
