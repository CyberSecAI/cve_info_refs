Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `password` parameter of the login functionality of the Matrimony project. The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input before using it in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `password` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can gain full control of administrator accounts, as well as all user accounts present on the system.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can potentially download all sensitive information stored within the database, using functions like `load_file`.
*  **System Information Disclosure:** The attacker can also obtain information about the server by using SQL injection to query system variables.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can achieve full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request.
*   **Login Form:** The attack vector is the login functionality. The attacker manipulates the `username` and `password` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter and understand the basics of SQL injection.
*   **Ability to Craft Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerability successfully.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided payloads use various SQL injection techniques, such as boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query injections, to achieve different effects.
*   The injection includes a sub-query that calls the `load_file` function to attempt reading a file or send request to an external server.
*   The attacker injects code into the `password` parameter, but also manipulates the `username` parameter to bypass initial authentication checks.

**Additional notes:**
*   The application is identified as "Matrimony" from "vetbossel.in".
*   The `README.md` file provides detailed information about the vulnerability, including the affected parameter, payloads, and the impact.
*   A link to a blog post with more info is provided
*   The status of the vulnerability is labeled as "CRITICAL".
