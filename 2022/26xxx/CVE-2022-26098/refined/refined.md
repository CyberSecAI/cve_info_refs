Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-26098:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-26098
*   **Description:** Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `sheifd_create` function of the `libsimba` library.
*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation within the `sheifd_create` function, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of input data passed to the `sheifd_create` function, causing it to write beyond allocated memory boundaries on the heap.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution on the target device.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted input to the vulnerable `sheifd_create` function. This input likely contains data that bypasses the insufficient validation and leads to a heap buffer overflow when processed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted input to the device that triggers the vulnerable function. This could be through a malicious application, a network service, or by other means that allow the attacker to interact with the `libsimba` library.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Android versions Q(10), R(11), and S(12) are all affected by this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by a patch that adds proper validation logic to the `sheifd_create` function, preventing the heap-based buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was privately disclosed on December 1, 2021.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in the SMR (Security Maintenance Release) for April 2022.
