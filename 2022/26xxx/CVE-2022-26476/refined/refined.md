- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the presence of default, hard-coded credentials in the Shared HIS component of Siemens Spectrum Power systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain administrative privileges to the Shared HIS component, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the affected systems.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the affected systems. The specific attack vector is network-based (AV:A), requiring adjacent network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a network-adjacent position to the affected systems. The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) and no user interaction is required (UI:N). They need to use the hardcoded default credentials to authenticate.
