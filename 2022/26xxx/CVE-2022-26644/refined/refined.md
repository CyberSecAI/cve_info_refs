Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Online Banking System Protect v1.0. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into various input fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into user profile names, system information, account names, and announcement titles. The injected script is then stored in the system and executed when other users or administrators view the affected pages.
*   The application fails to neutralize user-controlled input during web page generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A client can inject a malicious payload into their profile. When the administrator accesses the "account management" section, this payload executes within the administrator's session, allowing the attacker to steal the administrator's cookies. The attacker can then use the stolen cookie to impersonate the administrator and gain full control of the system.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** The injected JavaScript code can perform any actions within the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
*   **User Profile Name:** Injecting the malicious payload in the user's profile name field.
*   **System Info:** Injecting malicious code when editing the system info.
*    **Account Name:** Injecting malicious code when creating/editing accounts.
*   **Announcement Title:** Injecting malicious code in the announcement title.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability with a normal user account.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator into accessing a page that contains the injected malicious code to escalate privileges via cookie theft.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to interact with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided GitHub repository link contains proof of concept exploit code.
*  The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the Online Banking System.
* The exploit involves using a crafted Javascript payload.
* The vulnerability was discovered on March 30, 2022.
