- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices do not properly validate if a certain SNMP key exists.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) when handling SNMP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger a device reboot, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based, through sending SNMP requests to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker on the adjacent network can send specific SNMP requests.
