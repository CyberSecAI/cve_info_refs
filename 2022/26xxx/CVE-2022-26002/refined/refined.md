```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `sprintf` function, used to construct a command to be executed by `system`, does not validate the size of the input, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `factory` command handler within the InRouter302 console.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution. By overflowing the `command_line_buff` buffer, an attacker can overwrite return addresses and registers, and control the execution flow. This can result in the execution of arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially-crafted network request with a long argument to the `factory` command can trigger the buffer overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be logged in as a privileged user to access the `factory` command. However, the vulnerability can be chained with another vulnerability (TALOS-2022-1472) to exploit it from a lower-privileged user account. An attacker with the ability to send network packets to the device can exploit this."
