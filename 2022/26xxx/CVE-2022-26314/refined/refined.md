- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Initial passwords are generated in an insecure manner.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure password generation, allowing for brute force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker could efficiently brute force passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be unauthenticated and have network access to the affected application.
