- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries. Specifically, the `email` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists within the `email` parameter. The application is susceptible to boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database, or even gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the `email` parameter via a POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, with a malicious payload in the `email` parameter.
