# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1500

## InHand Networks InRouter302 console infactory\_wlan command injection vulnerability

##### May 10, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26075

### Summary

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the console infactory\_wlan functionality of InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.37. A specially-crafted series of network requests can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.37

### Product URLs

InRouter302 - <https://www.inhandnetworks.com/products/inrouter300.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

### Details

The InRouter302 is an industrial LTE router. It features remote management functionalities and several security protection mechanism, such as: VPN technologies, firewall functionalities, authorization management and several other features.

The InRouter302 offers telnet and sshd services. Both, when provided with the correct credentials, will allow access to the Router console.

Here is the prompt after the login:

```

The `infactory` command permits, provided the correct password, the access to the factory mode view. This mode permits to change some configuration and performs various tests. The factory mode view:

```
Router> infactory
input password:
Router(factory)#

dio            -- detect digital I/O
stategridsec   -- detect stategrid security chip
Router(factory)#

```

This mode offers several functionalities. For instance, the `wlan` functionality allows to set the SSID on a specific network interface.

The `wlan_functionality`:

```
undefined4 wlan_functionality(undefined4 param_1,char *args)

{
[...]

command_list[0] = args;
[...]
if (command_list[0] != (char *)0x0) {
    first_arg = (char *)get_next_token(command_list);
    if ((*first_arg != '\0') && (second_arg = (char *)get_next_token(command_list), *second_arg != '\0')) {
    is_2g = strncmp(first_arg,"2g",2);
    if (is_2g == 0) {
        [... perform a setup ...]
        is_status = strncmp(second_arg,"status",6);
        if (is_status == 0) {
            [...]
        }
        is_connect = strncmp(second_arg,"connect",7);
        if (is_connect == 0) {
        if (((command_list[0] != (char *)0x0) && (*command_list[0] != '\0')) &&
            (third_arg = (char *)get_next_token(command_list), *third_arg != '\0')) {                   [1]
            [...]
            snprintf(&set_SSID_string,0x80,"iwpriv %s set SSID=\"%s\"",&interface_name,third_arg);      [2]
            system(&set_SSID_string);                                                                   [3]
            [...]
}

```

If the first and second provided arguments are `2g` and `connect`, then the third one, parsed at `[1]`, will be later used at `[2]` to form the string `iwpriv <interface> set SSID="<third_arg>"`. This string will be later used at `[3]` as argument of the `system` function.

The third argument is not properly sanitized, and a command injection can occur at `[3]`. An attacker, able to reach the `wlan` functionality, would be able to obtain a root shell.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Provided the command `wlan 2g connect ;$(reboot)`, in the factory mode view, the device will reboot.

### Vendor Response

The vendor has updated their website and uploaded the latest firmware on it.
