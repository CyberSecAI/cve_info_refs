The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-26980, specifically a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Teampass Password Manager version 2.1.26.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way Teampass handles the `PATH_INFO` variable in the `index.php` file. It does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Reflected XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session.
* This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking/cookie theft.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Data theft.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a specially crafted URL with a malicious JavaScript payload embedded within the query parameters.
*   The victim needs to click the malicious link to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick a victim into opening the malicious link.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerable parameter is part of the URL.
* The provided proof of concept (PoC) shows the malicious payload being injected directly into the URL: `/?"><script>alert('rnpg')</script>"`.
