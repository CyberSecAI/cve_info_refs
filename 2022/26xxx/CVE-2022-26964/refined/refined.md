- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When exporting data, Remote Desktop Manager incorrectly decoded passwords that were also valid Base64 strings prior to password derivation. This reduced the effective length of the password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak password derivation due to the erroneous decoding of Base64 strings used as passwords during export.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Reduced strength of the password used to encrypt exported data, potentially making it easier to crack and access the exported sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need access to a file exported from Remote Desktop Manager. If the export password was also a valid Base64 string, its effective strength would have been reduced due to the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to an exported file protected with a password that is also a valid Base64 string.
