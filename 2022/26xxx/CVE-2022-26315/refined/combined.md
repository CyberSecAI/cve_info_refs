| While qrcp works on receive mode, uploader can edit the file name in HTTP request and add "../". Meanwhile, qrcp doesn't check legality of file name which lead to directory traversal. Env: qrcp-0.8.4, Windows 10 x86\_64, Ubuntu 20.04 x86\_64 Poc: [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69268043/156000336-2b3019b6-4cdb-40ed-a305-4e48bf3628e9.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69268043/156000944-8e1ab6e9-cbdd-42b2-8af2-839a5aff3036.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69268043/156001182-98f2a234-a91e-4e34-b8aa-57d9082051c2.png)  credit: starryloki,lu0sf |

| This was apparently an issue on the `mime/multipart` package of Go itself, which has been fixed 10 months ago, a few weeks after the latest release of qrcp.  Links:   * [https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/313809](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/%2B/313809) * [golang/go@784ef4c](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/784ef4c53135644d70f3476a4bd90010b9acff66)   I added a patch, should be all good now, can you please confirm? Thanks  **EDIT**: patch released as of version `0.8.5`. |
