{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The qrcp application, when operating in receive mode, does not properly validate file names provided in HTTP requests during file uploads. It does not sanitize filenames containing directory traversal sequences like `../`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal vulnerability",
        "Insufficient input validation",
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the server by crafting a malicious filename containing directory traversal sequences. This could lead to the attacker overwriting configuration files, executing malicious code, or causing denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious file name during a file transfer using the qrcp receive mode.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the qrcp server. This can be achieved if the attacker is on the same network as the victim, or if the server is exposed to the internet."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in qrcp versions prior to 0.8.5. The underlying issue was in the `mime/multipart` package of Go, which has been fixed. The fix in qrcp v0.8.5 includes a patch to prevent the directory traversal by extracting the base from the multipart filename."
