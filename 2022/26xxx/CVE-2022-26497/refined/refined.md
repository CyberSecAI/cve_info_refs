```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Share Room Access" dialog, specifically within the username field.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious XSS payloads that will be executed when a victim views the "Share Room Access" dialog, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions within the application.
- Attack vectors: The attacker needs to inject the XSS payload into the username field within the "Share Room Access" dialog.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker requires an active user account in the Greenlight application, and the victim must have previously shared access to a room with the attacker.
