##### CWE

CWE-787 - Out-of-bounds Write

##### DETAILS

The Asuswrt-Merlin New Gen is an open source firmware alternative for Asus routers.

The Asuswrt-Merlin New Gen’s httpd component, has a file named `cgi.c` that contains CGI helper functions. One of these functions is `unescape`:

```
void
unescape(char *s)
{
    char s_tmp[65535];
    unsigned int c;

    while ((s = strpbrk(s, "%+"))) {                                                                    [1]
        /* Parse %xx */
        if (*s == '%') {
            sscanf(s + 1, "%02x", &c);                                                                  [2]
            *s++ = (char) c;                                                                            [3]
            strlcpy(s_tmp, s + 2, sizeof(s_tmp));                                                       [4]
            strncpy(s, s_tmp, strlen(s) + 1);                                                           [5]
        }
        /* Space is special */
        else if (*s == '+')
            *s++ = ' ';
    }
}

```

This function takes as argument a string. If URL-encoded, this function will decode it. At `[1]`, a loop takes the next `%` or `+` in the string. If a `%` is found, then at `[2]`, the two characters following it are converted from hex values to a single character. At `[3]` the converted character replaces the `%` character and the string pointer advances. At `[4]` and `[5]`, the string after the already-parsed URL-encoded character is moved left by two positions. This will replace the parsed characters.
A string like “A…B%41%42” would go through the following steps:

```
|A|...|B|%|4|1|%|4|2|NULL|                       at    [1]/[2]
|A|...|B|A|4|1|%|4|2|NULL|                       after [3]
|A|...|B|A|%|4|2|NULL|NULL|NULL|                 after [5]

```

Eventually, after a second iteration of the loop, the string would end up like this:

```
|A|...|B|A|B|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|           after [5]

```

The `unescape` function assumes, wrongly, that after a `%` there are always at least two characters. If this is not the case, the instruction at `[4]` would cause an out-of-bounds read, and the one at `[5]` could cause the removal of the null terminator. This removal, in the next loop iteration, could cause an out-of-bounds write.
Let’s take for instance the following string “A…B%a”. This would go through the following steps:

```
|A|...|B|%|a|NULL|Q|Q|Q|Q|Q|                      at    [1]/[2]
|A|...|B|\n|a|NULL|Q|Q|Q|Q|Q|                     after [3]
            ^ s points to 'a'                     after [3]

```

After the string there is other data, in this scenario the string “QQQQQ”, `s+2`, at `[4]`, which will point to the first `Q`.
So after `[4]` the string will look like:

```
|A|...|B|%|a|NULL|Q|Q|Q|Q|Q|                      at    [1]/[2]
|A|...|B|\n|a|NULL|Q|Q|Q|Q|Q|                     after [3]
                   ^ s+2 point to the first Q     at [4]
|A|...|B|\n|Q|Q|Q|Q|Q|Q|Q|                        after [5]

```

The result would be the string “A…B\nQQQQQQQ…”.
