Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). Specifically, the WPS Office installer (wps.1.9.exe and wps.4.136.exe) will load a DLL (shcore.dll for wps.1.9.exe) if a file with the same name is present in the same directory as the installer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-427:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element, which allows for the loading of arbitrary DLL files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the user invoking the installer. An attacker can place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer. When the installer is launched, it will load the malicious DLL, potentially leading to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same folder as the WPS Office installer (wps.1.9.exe or wps.4.136.exe).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have write access to the directory where the WPS Office installer is located (or a common location like the browser's default download folder).
- The attacker must trick the user into placing the malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer.
- The user must then execute the installer.

**Summary of findings:**
The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer, which is loaded due to insecure DLL loading practices by the installer.
This requires local access and user interaction.
