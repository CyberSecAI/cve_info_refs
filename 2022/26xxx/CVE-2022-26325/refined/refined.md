    - Tricking a privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised page
    - Exploiting a vulnerable feature of the console that does not properly sanitize or validate user input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the Administration Console through a vulnerable input vector. The exact method is not explained.
- The attacker would likely have to have some level of access to the console itself or be able to manipulate a user of the console.

**Additional Notes:**
