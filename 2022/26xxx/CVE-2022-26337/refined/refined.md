- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Trend Micro Password Manager installer (versions 5.0.0.1262 and below) is vulnerable to an uncontrolled search path element vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled Search Path Element. This allows an attacker to introduce a malicious file in a location that the installer searches for libraries or executables, which can then be executed by the installer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected machine.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can place a specially crafted file in a location that the vulnerable installer will search, leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the machine where the vulnerable installer will run, and the ability to write to specific locations.
