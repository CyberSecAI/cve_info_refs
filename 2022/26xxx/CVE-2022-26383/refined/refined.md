Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-26383:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of window resizing after a popup has entered fullscreen mode. Specifically, when a popup window is resized using `resizeBy()` or `resizeTo()` after a fullscreen request, the browser fails to display the fullscreen notification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is that the lack of a fullscreen notification when resizing a fullscreen popup allows a malicious actor to potentially spoof the browser window. The resizing can hide the fullscreen UI elements, making the window appear as a regular, non-fullscreen window.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Deception:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to mislead users into believing they are interacting with a regular web page when they are actually in a fullscreen context. This can be used to conduct phishing attacks, display deceptive content, or perform other malicious activities without the user's awareness.
- **High Impact:** The severity of the impact is rated as high by Mozilla.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JavaScript manipulation:** A malicious webpage or script loaded in a popup window can use the `resizeBy()` or `resizeTo()` methods to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Triggering Fullscreen:** The attacker must first request fullscreen access for a popup window.
- **Resizing:** The exploit occurs when resizing the window after the fullscreen request but before the fullscreen UI notification is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Execution in a popup:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute JavaScript code within a popup window.
- **User Interaction:** The user would have to interact with a popup window that an attacker has control over.

**Additional Details from Bugzilla:**
- The fix was implemented across different platforms (GTK, Cocoa, and Windows) by ensuring that resizing a window after a fullscreen request will force the window to exit fullscreen.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 98 and Firefox ESR 91.7.
- The security team considered it easy to understand the vulnerability, but exploitation requires an unusual sequence of actions, making it harder to exploit in the wild.
