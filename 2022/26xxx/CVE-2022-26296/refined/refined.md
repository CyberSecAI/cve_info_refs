The provided content is related to CVE-2022-26296.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by two issues in the RISC-V BOOM processor:
1.  The processor transiently executes load instructions before checking for PMP (Physical Memory Protection) violations.
2.  The Branch Information Memory (BIM) table can be transiently updated using the accessed value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   Transient execution of load instructions without PMP checks.
-   BIM table can be transiently modified.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   A supervisor-mode software can transiently leak secrets from machine-mode software (firmware or enclave). The attack is similar to a Meltdown-type attack.
-   An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information via the side channel.

**Attack vectors:**
-   The attack is a transient execution attack, exploiting speculative execution in the processor.
-   The attacker needs to be running code in supervisor mode.
-   The attack relies on a load instruction that is performed speculatively before a PMP check.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to execute code in supervisor mode on the affected RISC-V BOOM processor.
-   The attacker also needs to be able to cause the processor to transiently execute load instructions with PMP violation and cause a transient update of the BIM table.
