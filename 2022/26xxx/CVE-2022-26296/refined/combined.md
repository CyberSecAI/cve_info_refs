### **[JaewonHur](/JaewonHur)** commented [Nov 9, 2021](#issue-1048061551)

| **Type of issue**: bug report  **Impact**: rtl refactoring  **Development Phase**: proposal  Hi, I found a new transient execution attack on risc-v boom. The attack relies on the bug [#558](https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom/issues/558), which is a performance bug originally. But the same bug can also be used to transiently poison the BIM table using a transiently accessed secret.  The attached PoC attack is a Meltdown type of attack where a supervisor-mode software transiently leaks a secret from the machine-mode software (i.e., either a firmware or an enclave). The attack is based on two vulnerabilities: **1) boom transiently executes load instruction before checking PMP violation**, and **2) BIM table can be transiently updated using the accessed value**. The attack is quite slow than using D-cache as a side channel, but it still works and almost correctly retrieves the secret value (i.e., *0xdeadbeef*).   * Used boom commit: [d77c2c3](https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom/commit/d77c2c3ff648bd5b18a932aa9f6b64dead7e3476) * How to reproduce the attack:  ```        /* in the given directory */        make clean; make        <path to simulator-chipyard-SmallBoomConfig> ./exploit.riscv  ```  This can be mitigated by fixing either one of two bugs above.
