* **Yahoo/Yahoo? JAPAN**
  + Stop doing unnecessary lookups of certain alias information. This solves deadlocks when a given Yahoo account has a ridiculously large (>500 buddies) list and may improve login speed for those on slow connections. ([#12532](http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/12532 "#12532: patch: Patch to fix lockups on large Yahoo buddy lists (closed: fixed)"))
  + Fix sending SMS messages. The lookup host changed on us. (Thanks to todo) ([#12688](http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/12688 "#12688: defect: libymsg.h YAHOO_SMS_CARRIER_URL no longer resolves (closed: fixed)")).
  + Improvements for some file transfer scenarios, but not all.

* **Windows**
  + Bonjour support now requires Apple Bonjour Print Services version 2.0.0 or newer ([âhttp://support.apple.com/kb/dl999](http://support.apple.com/kb/dl999)).

  + Fix NSS to work when reinitialized after being used. (Thanks to Ludovico Cavedon for the testcase)
  + Added support for PURPLE\_GNUTLS\_PRIORITIES environment variable. This can be used to specify GnuTLS priorities on a per-host basis. The format is "host=priority;host2=priority;...". The default priority can be overridden by using "\*" as the host. See the GnuTLS manual for documentation on the format of the priority strings.
  + Fix autoconf detection of Python. (Brad Smith)
  + Fix a crash when a Windows proxy (from IE) does not have a port. (Marten Klencke)

  + Added a menu set mood globally for all mood-supporting accounts (currently XMPP and ICQ).
  + Default binding of Ctrl+Shift+v to 'Paste as Plain Text' in conversation windows. This can be changed in .gtkrc-2.0. For example, Ctrl+v can be bound to 'Paste as Plain Text' by default.
  + Plugins can now handle markup in buddy names by attaching to the "drawing-buddy" signal. (Daniele Ricci, Andrea Piccinelli)
  + Be more accommodating when scaling down large images for use as buddy icons.

* **Bonjour**
  + Added support for IPv6. (Thanks to T\_X for testing)

* **AIM and ICQ**
  + X-Status (Custom ICQ status icon) support. Since most of the icons available reflect moods, this is labeled "Set Mood" on the Accounts->ICQ Account menu. (Andrew Ivanov, TomÃ¡Å¡ Kebert, Yuriy Yevgrafov, and trac users bob007, salieff, and nops)
  + Allow setting and displaying icons between 1x1 and 100x100 pixels for ICQ. Previously only icons between 48x48 and 52x64 were allowed.

  + Only support Google Talk's JID Domain Discovery extension (allowing a user to log in with "@gmail.com" or "@googlemail.com" interchangeably) for those two domains. This change was made due to interoperability issues with some BOSH Connection Managers and namespaced attributes.

* **Yahoo/Yahoo? JAPAN**
  + Attempt to better handle transparent proxies interfering with HTTP-based login.
  + Fix handling of P2P packets, thus fixing the loss of some messages.
  + Retrieve the pager server address from Yahoo!'s servers directly.

## version 2.6.6 (02/18/2010)

[View all closed tickets for this release.](http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.6.6)

* **libpurple**
  + Fix 'make check' on OS X. (David Fang)
  + Fix a quirk in purple\_markup\_html\_to\_xhtml that caused some messages
    to be improperly converted to XHTML.
  + Set "controlling-mode" correctly when initializing a media session.
    Fixes receiving voice calls from Psi.
  + When looking up DNS records, use the type of record returned by the
    server (instead of the type we asked for) to determine how to process
    the record.
  + Fix an issue with parsing XML attributes that contain "&lt;br&gt;".
    See ChangeLog.API for more details.

* **General**
  + Correctly disable all missing dependencies when using the
    --disable-missing-dependencies option. (Gabriel Schulhof)

* **Gadu-Gadu**
  + Fix display of avatars after a server-side change. (Krzysztof
    Klinikowski)

* **AIM**
  + Allow setting and displaying icons between 1x1 and 100x100 pixels.
    Previously only icons between 48x48 and 50x50 were allowed.

* **MSN**
  + Fix CVE-2010-0277, a possible remote crash when parsing an incoming
    SLP message. (Discovered by Fabian Yamaguchi)
  + File transfer requests will no longer cause a crash if you delete the
    file before the other side accepts.
  + Received files will no longer hold an extra lock after completion,
    meaning they can be moved or deleted without complaints from your OS.
  + Buddies who sign in from a second location will no longer cause an
    unnecessary chat window to open.
  + Support setting an animated GIF as a buddy icon.
  + Numerous code cleanups and memory savings.

* **MySpace**
  + Fix a leak and crash when retrieving buddy icons.

* **XMPP**
  + Less likely to send messages to a contact's idle/inactive resource.
    Previously, if a message was received from a specific resource,
    responses would be sent to that resource until either it went offline
    or a message is received from another resource. Now, messages are
    sent to the bare JID upon receipt of any presence change from the
    contact.
  + Added support for the SCRAM-SHA-1 SASL mechanism. This is only
    available when built without Cyrus SASL support.
  + When getting info on a domain-only (server) JID, show uptime
    (when given by the result of the "last query") and don't show status
    as offline.
  + Fix getting info on your own JID.
  + Wrap XHTML messages in <p>, as described in XEP-0071, for
    compatibility with some clients.
  + Don't do an SRV lookup for a STUN server associated with the account
    if one is already set globally in prefs.
  + Don't send custom smileys larger than the recommended maximum object
    size specified in the BoB XEP. This prevents a client from being
    disconnected by servers that dislike overly-large stanzas.
  + Fix receiving messages without markup over an Openfire BOSH
    connection (forcibly put the stanzas in the jabber:client namespace).
  + The default value for the file transfer proxies is automatically
    updated when an account connects, if it is still the old (broken)
    default (from 'proxy.jabber.org' to 'proxy.eu.jabber.org').
  + Fix an issue where libpurple created duplicate buddies if the roster
    contains a buddy in two groups that differ only by case
    (e.g. "XMPP" and "xmpp") (or not at all).

* **Yahoo**
  + Don't send <span> and </span> tags. (Fartash Faghri)
  + Support PingBox. PingBoxes will appear as pbx/PingBoxName. (Kartik
    Mohta)

* **Pidgin**
  + Fix CVE-2010-0423, a denial of service attack due to the parsing
    of large numbers of smileys. (Discovered by Antti Hayrynen)
  + Correctly size conversation and status box entries when the
    interior-focus style property is diabled. (Gabriel Schulhof)
  + Correctly handle a multiline text field being required in a
    request form. (Thanks to Florian Zeitz for finding this problem)
  + Search friends by email-addresses in the buddy list. (Luoh Ren-Shan)
  + Allow dropping an image on Custom Smiley window to add a new one.
  + Prompt for confirmation when clearing a whiteboard (doodle) session.
    (Kartik Mohta)
  + Use the "hand" cursor when hovering over usernames in chat history to
    indicate that the username is an actionable item.
  + Double-clicking usernames in chat history will open an IM with that
    user.
  + Put an icon on the "Filter" button in the debug window.
  + Don't treat "/messages/like/this " as commands.
  + Explicitly mark user interaction when inserting smilies from the
    toolbar so "Undo" correctly removes these smilies.
  + Clicking "New" or "Saved" in the status selector menu while typing a
    status message no longer keeps the status entry area stuck in "typing"
    mode forever.
  + Show tooltips for ellipsized conversation tabs. On older systems,
    tooltips will show for all tabs.
  + The File Transfers and Debug Window windows are no longer created as
    dialogs. These windows should now have minimize buttons in many
    environments in which they were previously missing
    (including Windows).
  + Smiley themes with Windows line endings no longer cause theme
    descriptions not to be displayed in the theme selector.

* **Finch**
  + Fix CVE-2010-0420, a possible remote crash when handling chat room
    buddy names.
  + Rebindable 'move-first' and 'move-last' actions for tree widgets. So
    it is possible to jump to the first or last entry in the buddy list
    (and other such lists) by pressing home or end key (defaults)
    respectively.

  + Add a hold button to the media window.
  + Fix a bug where the conversation backlog stops scrolling in a very busy chat room.

    ```
    gtk-tooltip-timeout = 500

    ```
    To completely disable tooltips (e.g. if you had an old tooltip\_delay of zero), add this to `~/.purple/gtkrc-2.0`:
    ```
    gtk-enable-tooltips = 0

## Version 2.4.2 (05/17/2008)

[View all closed tickets for this release.](http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.4.2)

* **libpurple**
  + In MySpaceIM, messages from spambots are discarded (Justin Williams)
  + Strip mIRC formatting codes from quit and part messages.
  + IRC now displays ban lists in-channel for joined channels.
  + Fixed a bug where the list of loaded plugins would get removed when switching between different operating systems.
  + Fix reception of IRC PART without a part message on Undernet (fixes a problem with litter in the channel user list).
  + IRC no longer crashes on /list on servers which erroneously omit RPL\_LISTSTART.
  + Update the [NetworkManager](NetworkManager.html) support to use D-Bus directly, instead of libnm-glib. Hopefully it's stable now. It will now compile by default if you have D-Bus support and [NetworkManager](NetworkManager.html).h. (Elliott Sales de Andrade)
  + MSN buddy list synchronization is now more forgiving, only asking about buddies who have disappeared completely from the server list and not those that have simply moved groups.
  + IRC will now try to append 1-9 to your nick if it is in use, instead of substituting the last character with 1-9 where possible.
  + Bonjour buddies will be saved persistently if they're moved out of the "Bonjour" group. (Eion Robb)

* **Pidgin**
  + The typing notification in the conversation history can be disabled or customized (font, color etc.) in .gtkrc-2.0.
  + Added a plugin (not installed by default) which adds a Send button back to the conversation window. People without physical keyboards have a hard time with the lack of the button.
  + Clicking on the buddyicon in the conversation window toggles the size of the icon between small and large.
  + The settings of a chat (e.g. Handle in an XMPP chat, or Exchange in an AIM chat) can be edited from its context menu in the buddy list.
  + Add a "Present conversation window" preference to the Message Notification plugin; the "Raise conversation window" option does not unminimize windows or draw attention to them when they are on other workspaces--the "Present" option should.
  + Add a preference to set Escape as the keyboard shortcut for closing the conversation window.
  + Add an option in the context menu to disable smileys in the selected text in the conversation history/log viewer. This should help people who regularly paste code in conversations.
  + Add a preference to choose the minimum size of the text input area in lines.
  + Moved the "Local alias" field in the Modify Account dialog to be below the "User Options" heading on the "Basic" tab.
  + Number of room occupants is now shown in chat tooltips where possible

* **General**
  + The configure script now dies on more absent dependencies. The --disable-xxx arguments to configure can be used to bypass unneeded dependencies. This will also cause the configure script to die if an --enable-xxx option is used and the dependencies it requires are missing.
  + The Evolution integration plugin must now be explicitly enabled. Use the --enable-gevolution argument to configure to enable it.
  + The Contact Availability Prediction plugin must now be explicitly enabled. Use the --enable-cap argument to configure to enable it.

* **Finch**
  + New default binding ctrl+x to open context menus.
  + Menu triggers and other bindings will no longer conflict.
  + Middle click pastes the internal clipboard (when mouse support is enabled).

[View all closed tickets for this release.](http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.4.1)

* **libpurple**
  + Treat AIM Unicode messages as UTF-16 rather than UCS-2; this should have no functional effect, other than continued support on systems which have dropped UCS-2 conversions.
  + Add support for setting buddy icons on Gadu-Gadu (Tomasz Salacinski)
  + Fix a crash when clearing the buddy icon for an account on XMPP
  + Fix a crash during login for some ICQ accounts

* **libpurple**
  + Added support for offline messages for AIM accounts (thanks to Matthew Goldstein)
  + Fixed various problems with loss of status messages when going or returning from idle on MySpaceIM.

  + Save the conversation "Enable Logging" option per-contact (Moos Heintzen)
  + Typing notifications are now shown in the conversation area

  + The default keybinding for dump-screen is now M-D and uses a file request dialog. M-d will properly delete-forward-word, and M-f has been fixed to imitate readline's behavior.
  + New bindings alt+tab and alt+shift+tab to help navigating between the higlighted windows (details on the man page).
  + Recently signed on (or off) buddies blink in the buddy list.
  + New action 'Room List' in the action list can be used to get the list of available chat rooms for an online account.
  + The 'Grouping' plugin can be used for alternate grouping in the buddylist. The current options are 'Group Online/Offline?' and 'No Group'.

## Version 2.3.1 (12/7/2007)

[View all closed tickets for this release.](http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.3.1) NOTE: Due to the way this release was made, it is possible that bugs marked as fixed in 2.3.1 will not be fixed until the next release.

## Version 2.3.0 (11/24/2007)

[View all closed tickets for this release.](http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.3.0) NOTE: Some bugs marked fixed in 2.2.1, 2.2.2 or 2.2.3 may not have been fixed until this release (2.3.0).

* **libpurple**
  + Real usernames are now shown in the system log.
  + We now honor a PURPLE\_DISABLE\_DEPRECATED define to allow plugins to catch deprecated functions earlier rather than later.
  + Thanks to a patch from Intel, the Bonjour prpl now supports file transfers using XEP-0096 and XEP-0065. This should enable file transfers between libpurple clients and Gajim clients, but will not work with iChat or Adium as they use a different file transfer implementation.
  + XMPP password changes that return errors no longer cause the saved password to be changed.
  + XMPP file transfer support has been enhanced to support sending files through a proxy when the server supports discovering a a bytestream proxy. This should make file transfers much more reliable. The next release will add support for manually specifying a proxy when the server doesn't advertise one.
* **Pidgin**
  + If a plugin says it can't be unloaded, we now display an error and remove the plugin from the list of saved plugins so it won't load at the next startup. Previously, we were ignoring this case, which could lead to crashes.
  + Connection errors are now reported in mini-dialogs inside the buddy list, rather than as buttons in the buddy list and with dialog boxes. If several accounts are disabled when you sign on elsewhere, you can now re-enable them all with a single click.
  + Added tooltips to the Room List window to show full topics
  + Added buttons in preferences to access GNOME network and browser preferences configuration dialogs when running under GNOME
  + If you alias a buddy to an alias that is already present within a particular group, we now offer to merge the buddies into the same contact.
  + A music emblem is now displayed in the buddy list for a buddy if we know she is listening to some soothing music.
  + Added a 'Move to' menu in buddy list context menu for moving buddies to other groups as an alternative to dragging.
  + Group headings are now marked via an underline instead of a different color background.
  + It is now possible to mark a chat on your buddy list as "Persistent" so you do not leave the chat when the window or tab is closed.
  + The auto-join option for chats is now listed in the "Add Chat" dialog along with the new persistence option.
  + Closing an IM no longer immediately closes your conversation. It will now remain active for a short time so that if the conversation resumes, the history will be retained. A preference has been added to toggle this behavior.
  + The "Smiley" menu has been moved to the top-level of the toolbar.
  + Pidgin's display is now saved with the command line for session restoration. (David Mohr)
  + ICQ Birthday notifications are shown as buddy list emblems.
  + Plugin actions are now available from the docklet context menu in addition to the Tool menu of the buddy list.
  + The manual page has been heavily rewritten to bring it in line with current functionality.
* **Finch**
  + If a plugin says it can't be unloaded, we now display an error and remove the plugin from the list of saved plugins so it won't load at the next startup. Previously, we were ignoring this case, which could lead to crashes.
  + It's possible to bind key-strokes to specific menuitems in the windows. Read the 'Menus' section in the man-page for details.
  + 'transpose-chars' operation for the entry boxes. The default key-binding is ctrl+t.
  + 'yank' operation for the entry boxes. The default binding is ctrl+y
* **Windows-specific changes**
  + Updated SILC to use SILC Toolkit 1.1.5.

  + libpurple now looks for a default `prefs.xml` in the `CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA` directory (e.g. `\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\purple\prefs.xml`) similarly to how this is done on other platforms.
  + Updated GTK+ Runtime to 2.12.1 rev A.

[View all closed tickets for this release](http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.1.0)

* **libpurple**
  + Core changes to allow UIs to use second-granularity for scheduling. Pidgin and Finch, which use the glib event loop, were changed to use g\_timeout\_add\_seconds() on glib >= 2.14 when possible. This allows glib to better group our longer timers to increase power efficiency. (Arjan van de Ven with Intel Corporation)

* **Build Changes**
  + With the Core/UI split complete, it is now possible to build libpurple without any UIs, creating a library upon which other UIs may be constructed
  + A new ncurses-based console UI called Finch is now available (Sadrul Habib Chowdhury, Google Summer of Code)
  + Reorganized the source tree to split apart the code for the UI changes and libpurple targets
  + libxml2 is now required. We switched from gmarkup to libxml2 for more correct XML parsing.
* **Status System**
  + The code dealing with buddy and account status, away messages, away states, online/offline, etc has been completely rewritten. Huge thanks to Christian Hammond, Dave West, Daniel Atallah and Sadrul Habib Chowdhury.
  + Your status can now be set from inside the buddy list using the selector at the bottom of the window.
  + To see messages when a buddy signs on or off, goes away, or becomes idle, load the "Buddy State Notification" plugin
* **Buddy List**
  + Performance when manipulating and displaying the buddy list has been significantly improved (Aaron Sheldon, Google Summer of Code)
  + Buddy icons are now shown in tooltips (Felipe Contreras)
  + Tooltips now contain additional information about a "Person" that contains multiple online buddies
  + Added a "Last Seen" field to buddy tooltips
  + Contacts will auto-expand when buddies are dragged around

  + Improved buddy list searching with CTRL+F
  + Ability to set a buddy icon for all of your accounts at once via the buddy list (You can still set per-account icons via the account editor)
  + The space wasted by the group expanders has been eliminated and the expander setting in .gtkrc-2.0 is no longer needed
  + Authorization requests don't popup new dialogs anymore. They are displayed at the bottom of the buddy list instead.
  + New mail notifications don't popup new dialogs anymore. They are displayed at the top of the buddy list instead.
* **Conversations and Chats**
  + Timestamps honor the locale. To use the traditional style, enable the "Message Timestamp Formats" plugin. The plugin also provides options to show dates in timestamps.
  + Messages from buddies in the same "Person" will automatically use the same conversation window.
  + The "Send As" menu has been replaced with a more appropriate "Send To" menu based on "Persons" on your buddy list
  + Message formatting persists between messages (Igor Belyi)
  + Full message background colors are now supported
  + Smooth scrolling when receiving a new message
  + Screenname colors in chats now chosen intelligently
  + Conversation buffer scrollback limited to avoid large memory usage in active conversations
  + Control-Shift-Tab will reverse cycle through the conversation tabs (James Vega)
  + Many problems related to having an IM conversation and a chat open with the same name are fixed (Andrew Hart)

  + Ability to find the last message from a user in a chat (Levi Bard and Sadrul Habib Chowdhury)
  + Formatting is preserved across messages (There are known issues with pasting formatted text. Either use "Paste as Plain Text", hit Ctrl-R after pasting, or use the Clear Formatting button on the toolbar.)

  + Bi-Directional text support improvements for GtkIMHtml (Shlomi Loubaton)
* **Sounds**
  + Beautiful new default sounds (Brad Turcotte)

  + Logs are now saved with the current timezone, which is displayed in the log viewer
  + Text logs are linkified, so URLs are clickable
  + The old logger now caches file offsets, so opening the log viewer for buddies with old logs should be much faster now if you have large log files (except the first time for a log, when the cache is built)

  + Plugins are now accessed through a separate dialog from the Tools menu of the Buddy List
  + Newly installed plugins can now be activated without restarting Pidgin (Sadrul Habib Chowdhury)

# cve-2022-26491-00

| Summary | MITM when used without DNSSEC |
| --- | --- |
| Date | 2022-04-28 |
| CVE Number | [CVE-2022-26491](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26491) || Discovered By | moparisthebest |
| Fixed In Release | 2.14.9 |

### Description

If not using DNSSEC it is trivial to perform a man in the middle attack a
client via DNS spoofing. You can find more discussion in the
[XMPP Standards Archives](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2022-February/038759.html).

### Mitigation

Removed the code that supported the `_xmppconnect` DNS TXT record.

Instead of having (negated) positive examples, I think it would be better to make explicit negative examples: "e.g. 'http://' or 'ws://'", otherwise uneducated users may decide they consider http without TLS secure enough.

nits:

* "and **clients** MUST ignore any..."
* "e.g." instead of "eg"
* Add full stop before "this provides secure delegation"
* "the the"
* Add full stop at end of item

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks for the feedback, I've re-worded it and fixed the other issues you identified, but I really want to keep the "allow these" wording vs "do not allow these" as it encourages implementations to implement a list of allowed protocols which is more secure than a list of disallowed ones.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Yes, this way is even better, given that as of now, https and wss are effectively the only schemes that should be supported, as bosh and websockets are the only alternative connection methods you can discover with the XEP.

Only other nit:

The markdownish `*or*` doesn't really fit here. We have `<em>or</em>` or `<strong>or</strong>` for this. :)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Package        : pidgin
Version        : 2.12.0-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-26491

An issue was discovered in Pidgin before 2.14.9. A remote attacker
who can spoof DNS responses can redirect a client connection to a
malicious server. The client will perform TLS certificate
verification of the malicious domain name instead of the original
XMPP service domain, allowing the attacker to take over control
over the XMPP connection and to obtain user credentials and all
communication content.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
2.12.0-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.

For the detailed security status of pidgin please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pidgin>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Remove \_xmppconnect support

It has always been vulnerable to MITM attacks when it is not used with DNSSEC,

and has been removed from XEP-0156 because of that. We have been issued

CVE-2022-26491 for this issue.
