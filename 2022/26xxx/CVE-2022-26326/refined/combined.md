### 1.1 Identity Server Authentication APIs

This release introduces Identity Server authentication APIs. These APIs enable you to build your own end-to-end login experience replacing the built-in user portal login experience. You can use these APIs in the following scenarios:

Primary Authentication: Verifies the end-users' credentials using one of the following methods:

* Name/Password - Basic
* Name/Password - Form
* Secure Name/Password - Basic
* Secure Name/Password - Form

Multi-factor Authentication: When Access Manager is integrated with Advanced Authentication through the plug-in approach, the API supports multi-factor authentication for the following methods:

* Smartphone
* Voice call

For more information about these APIs, see [Identity Server Authentication API](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/swagger_ui/?url=/documentation/access-manager/developer-documentation-5.0/resources/authn-api-1.0.0.yaml).

You can also configure the default user attributes that you want in the authentication response.

For information about configuring the attributes list, see [Identity Server Authentication APIs](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/access-manager/5.0/admin/b13e0zob.html#authentication_api) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 1.2 Integration of Microsoft Windows Autopilot with Access Manager

Microsoft Windows Autopilot is an end-to-end Windows device management solution. Irrespective of the locations, users can log in to the device using their email ID. When integrated with Microsoft Azure, Access Manager supports the Windows Autopilot feature.

For more information about Windows Autopilot, see â[Overview of Windows Autopilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/windows-autopilot)â.

For more information about how to use this feature in Access Manager, see [Enabling Access Manager with Microsoft Windows Autopilot](../admin/microsoft-autopilot.html#microsoft-autopilot) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

* [Returned Attribute for an Authenticated User Does Not Contain the Required Value for Authentication API](#t4idppm1ayqh)
* [Authentication API Is Not Picking Up the Properties for the LDAP Search](#t4ijv02z2ghb)
* [Third Factor of Advanced Authentication Server Is Not Executed Even When IDP Logs State that Contract is Supported](#t4ijwiw5vqsk)
* [After Upgrading to Access Manager 5.0.2, OAuth Clients' Authorization Code Requests Fail](#t4ioq5ve39vn)

Issue: You can only modify or change attribute sets to different attribute sets. After the attribute set is updated for Authentication API, it cannot be rolled back to the default settings

Workaround: Do not add any attributes in the Selected Attribute field. By default, Authentication API responds with given\_name, family\_name, and email attributes when no attribute set is configured.

### 7.2 Returned Attribute for an Authenticated User Does Not Contain the Required Value for Authentication API

Workaround: Clear the session cookie if the first user has not logged out.

### 7.3 Authentication API Is Not Picking Up the Properties for the LDAP Search

Workaround: There is no workaround for the issue.

### 7.4 Third Factor of Advanced Authentication Server Is Not Executed Even When IDP Logs State that Contract is Supported

Workaround: Do not use third factor of Advanced Authentication Server.

### 7.5 After Upgrading to Access Manager 5.0.2, OAuth Clients' Authorization Code Requests Fail

Workaround: Install Access Manager 5.0.2.1. For more information about the patch, see [Access Manager 5.0 Service Pack 2 Patch 1 Release Notes](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/access-manager/5.0/accessmanager502-p1-release-notes/accessmanager502-p1-release-notes.html).
