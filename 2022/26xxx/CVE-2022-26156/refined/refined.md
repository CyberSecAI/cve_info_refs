      "content": "# CVE-2022-26156\n\nAn issue was discovered in the web application in Cherwell Service\nManagement (CSM) 10.2.3. Injection of a malicious payload within the\nRelayState= parameter of the HTTP request body results in the\nhijacking of the form action. Form-action hijacking vulnerabilities\narise when an application places user-supplied input into the action\nURL of an HTML form. An attacker can use this vulnerability to\nconstruct a URL that, if visited by another application user, will\nmodify the action URL of a form to point to the attacker's server."
