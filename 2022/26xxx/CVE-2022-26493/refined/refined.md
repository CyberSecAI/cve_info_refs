- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The miniOrange SAML SP module fails to verify the existence of a signature in SAML authentication communications. Specifically, it does not check if a signature is present, only if the existing signature matches the expected one.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Authentication bypass: An attacker can bypass authentication by removing the signature from a SAML assertion.
    - Authorization bypass: By modifying the SAML assertion, an attacker can impersonate existing users or elevate their privileges to any existing role.
    - SAML Replay Attack:  Captured SAML assertions can be reused.
    - Missing signature verification: Failure to verify the existence of the signature enables the vulnerability. Enabling signature or certificate checking doesn't mitigate the issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application with arbitrary user accounts and roles. This allows them to bypass credential checks, two-factor authentication, and elevate privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Man-in-the-middle attacks: Intercepting SAML responses between the IDP and the web application.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS): Potentially obtaining SAML assertions via XSS vulnerabilities
    - Replay attacks: Reusing previously captured SAML assertions
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to intercept HTTP requests.
    - Knowledge (or ability to guess) of valid usernames within the application.
    - Ability to modify and forward HTTP requests.
