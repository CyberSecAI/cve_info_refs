{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Windows resolves command names to the correct executable. When a command is executed without a full path, Windows searches for the executable in the current working directory before checking the system's PATH environment variable. This behavior is inconsistent with other operating systems.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can place a malicious executable with the same name as a commonly used command (e.g., `git.exe`) in a directory where a vulnerable package manager is executed. When the package manager attempts to run the legitimate command, it will instead execute the malicious one, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can result in data theft, modification, or the installation of backdoors and malware.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack requires the user to work in a directory containing attacker-controlled files. For example, when installing a package from a Git repository, the package manager will execute `git` commands. If the current working directory contains a malicious `git.exe`, it will be executed instead of the legitimate Git binary.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable with the same name as a command used by the vulnerable package manager in a directory that the victim is using. This may be done by tricking the user into cloning a malicious git repository or other means of social engineering."
  },
  "patch": "The vulnerability is fixed by using the safe-execa package instead of execa. The fix ensures that the commands are always run using the full path to the executable, therefore preventing the execution of malicious code with the same command name in the current working directory."
