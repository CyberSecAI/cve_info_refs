- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path element in the PresentMon software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly control the search path, leading to a potential for privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user with local access can potentially escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system where the vulnerable PresentMon software is installed. The attacker also needs to be able to trigger a specific sequence of actions in the software which makes it vulnerable to the uncontrolled search path element.
