Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-26986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in ImpressCMS. Specifically, the `mimetypeid` parameter in the `admin.php` module is vulnerable to SQL injection. This parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses user-supplied input (`mimetypeid`) in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can read sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify data stored in the database.
- **System Compromise:** A misconfigured system might allow an attacker to upload a malicious web shell, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ImpressCMS/htdocs/modules/system/admin.php` endpoint.
- The `mimetypeid` parameter is sent within the POST request data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ImpressCMS instance.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit requires an attacker to:
1. Log in with administrative credentials.
2. Send a POST request to `/ImpressCMS/htdocs/modules/system/admin.php?fct=mimetype&op=mod&mimetypeid=1` with the vulnerable parameter `mimetypeid`.
3. The `mimetypeid` parameter is injected with a malicious SQL payload, such as `1 AND (SELECT 3583 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))XdxE)` for a time-based blind SQL injection.

The provided exploit demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function to confirm the vulnerability.
