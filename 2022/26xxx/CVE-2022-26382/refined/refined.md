Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox renders autofill preview text. This text, which is displayed when a user hovers over an autofill suggestion, was rendered using page fonts, making it susceptible to side-channel attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Font Side-Channel Attack:** Attackers could use specially crafted fonts to infer the content of the autofill preview text through:
    *   **Size:** Varying character widths to deduce content using size-related properties (like `scrollWidth`).
    *   **Ligatures:** Using ligatures with unusual sizes to detect specific character sequences.
    *   **Font Face:** Utilizing `@font-face` with `unicode-range` to identify characters used in the font.
*   **Inference via Options:**
    *   Autofill could match a large number of `<option>` elements, enabling brute-force or de-anonymization attacks.
    *   Specifically, email addresses could be reliably inferred.
*   **`select` element width:** The width of the `<select>` element changes based on the selected option, thus revealing the content.
*   **`option` element layout:** The width and font related properties of `<option>` elements could be used to infer information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could steal sensitive information displayed in the autofill preview, including names, addresses, credit card details, and other personal information.
*   **Social Engineering:** The vulnerability could be exploited through social engineering techniques where a user is tricked into activating autofill by hovering or using the keyboard.
*   **Automated Attacks:** Automated attacks could be crafted to collect user data or make unauthorized purchases quickly without the user noticing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker would need to create a malicious website or compromise a legitimate one.
*   **Crafted Fonts and CSS:** The attacker would need to craft specific fonts and CSS to carry out the side-channel attacks.
*   **Hidden or Manipulated Fields:** Hidden or manipulated fields could be used to force autofill to activate.
*   **Malicious `<option>` elements:** The attacker could insert a large number of  `<option>` elements with various combinations to identify the previewed option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server Control:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to the victim.
*   **CSS/Font Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of CSS and font manipulation techniques.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim would have to interact with a form on the attacker's website.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by pinning the font family and size of the preview text to a system font, hiding overflow, and limiting matching `<option>` elements.
*   A similar issue was present in Chromium, which was patched in response.
*   The fix was not backported to ESR91 due to the complexity and risks involved in backporting the changes.
