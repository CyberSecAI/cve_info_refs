- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication for critical functions within the Open Automation Software (OAS) Platform. Specifically, the `SecureAddSecurity` and `SecureConfigValues` commands, used to create and configure security groups, can be accessed without proper authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306): The OAS Platform does not require authentication to execute configuration commands like `SecureAddSecurity` and `SecureConfigValues`.
    - External control of configuration: Unauthenticated network requests can be used to create custom Security Groups and grant file transfer permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create a custom Security Group with file transfer permissions, which can then be applied to users. This would allow the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data through the file transfer functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a series of specially crafted network requests to the OAS Platform's configuration port (TCP/58727 by default)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the OAS Platform's configuration port (TCP/58727). No prior authentication is needed.
