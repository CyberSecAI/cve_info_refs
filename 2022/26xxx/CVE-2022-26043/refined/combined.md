# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1489

## Open Automation Software Platform Engine SecureAddSecurity external config control vulnerability

##### May 25, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26043

### Summary

An external config control vulnerability exists in the OAS Engine SecureAddSecurity functionality of Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112. A specially-crafted series of network requests can lead to the creation of a custom Security Group. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112

### Product URLs

OAS Platform - <https://openautomationsoftware.com/knowledge-base/getting-started-with-oas/>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

### CWE

CWE-306 - Missing Authentication for Critical Function

### Details

The OAS Platform was built to facilitate the simplified transfer of data between various proprietary devices and applications. It can be used to connect products from multiple different vendors, connect a product to a custom application, and more.

By sending a series of properly-formatted unauthenticated configuration messages to the OAS Platform, it is possible to create a custom OAS Security Group with File Transfer permissions. By default these messages can be sent to TCP/58727 and, if successful, will be processed by the user `oasuser` with normal user permissions.

Some configuration commands such as `SecureTransferFiles` require an OAS User account in an authorized OAS Security Group with File Transfer permissions before they can be successfully processed. The default security group that gets applied to users does not include this File Transfer permission.

Through use of the `SecureAddSecurity` and `SecureConfigValues` commands, it is possible to create a custom Security Group and subsequently apply the File Transfer permission, all from an unauthenticated context.

A `SecureAddSecurity` request resembles the following:

```

When successfully processed, this will result in a new Security Group that can be applied to any new or existing user, giving that user any permissions allowed by the group.

### Mitigation

The easiest way to mitigate attempts to exploit this vulnerability is to prevent access to the configuration port (TCP/58727 by default) when not actively configuring the OAS Platform. Additionally, use a dedicated user account to run the OAS Platform and ensure that user account does not have any more permissions than absolutely necessary.
