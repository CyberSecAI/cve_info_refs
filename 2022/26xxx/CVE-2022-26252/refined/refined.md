{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient input sanitization when retrieving plugin installation scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive files like the root user's private SSH key (`id_rsa`).",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to the `/ajax?action=get_lines` endpoint with a malicious `filename` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the App Store and initiate plugin installation. They need to modify the installation script path via the `filename` parameter in the POST request to point to sensitive files."
