Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-26952:

**1. Verification:**

*   The release notes for Digi Passport firmware version 1.5.2 explicitly mention **CVE-2022-26952** as a security fix.
*   The GitHub repositories provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code snippets and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The root cause is the insecure use of `sprintf()` function for string concatenation within the web server component (`webs` binary). Specifically, when handling redirects after failed authentication attempts. The server concatenates the requested page path to a fixed string "authen.asp?page=" using sprintf without any bounds checking.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. The `sprintf()` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack when a long string is provided in the `page` parameter.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a denial of service. The buffer overflow corrupts the stack, leading to a segmentation fault and crashing the `webs` service.
    *   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the provided exploit only causes a crash, the vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution if a carefully crafted payload overwrites return addresses and other critical data on the stack.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to a protected endpoint that triggers a redirect.
*   **Malicious `page` Parameter:** The attacker injects a long string into the `page` parameter of the URL (e.g., `/ilo.asp?aaaaaaaa...`). This long string is then concatenated using `sprintf` without bounds checking leading to the overflow.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Digi Passport device.
    *   **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet (from github):**
    ```c
    addi    r0, r31, 0x8c {var_1b4}
    mr      r3, r0 {var_1b4}
    lis     r9, 0x1016
    addi    r4, r9, 0x1210  {data_10161210, "authen.asp?page=%s"}
    lwz     r5, 524(r31) {var_34_1}
    bl      sprintf
    ```
    This code shows the sprintf call where the format string `authen.asp?page=%s` is concatenated with user-controlled data.
*   **Exploit Details (from github):**
    The provided Python PoC demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by crafting a GET request with a long "page" parameter.
*   **Architecture:** The code snippets and debugger output indicate that the target architecture is likely PowerPC.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-26952 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Digi Passport's web server that arises from the unsafe use of `sprintf()` when handling redirects for unauthenticated users accessing protected pages. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with an overly long `page` parameter to cause a denial-of-service. More advanced exploitation could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

This information is more detailed than what is typically available in the basic CVE description, as it includes the root cause of the vulnerability, code snippets from the vulnerable binary, and a practical demonstration of how to exploit it.
