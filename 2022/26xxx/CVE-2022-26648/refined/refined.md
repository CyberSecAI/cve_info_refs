The provided content is related to CVE-2022-26648.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The affected devices do not properly validate the GET parameter "XNo" of incoming HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. Specifically, the lack of proper size checking of the "XNo" parameter before copying it into a buffer can lead to a classic buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause the affected devices to crash (Denial-of-Service).
- Possible impact to Confidentiality and Integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request with an oversized "XNo" parameter to the webserver of the vulnerable devices.
- The attack vector is adjacent network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be on the adjacent network of the target device.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker has to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
