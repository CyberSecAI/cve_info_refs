{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Inadequate checks on filenames within a tar archive file during stream restore using JetStream.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a classic 'Zip Slip' vulnerability, where a malicious tar archive can contain filenames with path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) allowing an attacker to write files outside the intended directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause the NATS server to write arbitrary content to an attacker-controlled filename, potentially overwriting system files or executing arbitrary code. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the JetStream API's stream restore function. An attacker provides a crafted tar archive as part of a restore operation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a NATS user who has access to the JetStream API, specifically the stream restore functionality. They can be an untrusted user within the NATS system."
