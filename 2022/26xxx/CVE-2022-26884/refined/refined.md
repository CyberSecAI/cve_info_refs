- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The log server in Apache DolphinScheduler allows unauthenticated access to read any files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically lack of authentication on the log server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server where Apache DolphinScheduler is running.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the log server of Apache DolphinScheduler is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable service and does not require prior authentication.
