Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a code section related to gallery insertion within the document addition form in SPIP. This code, which hadn't been used since SPIP 3.0, was still present for backward compatibility.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A critical vulnerability allowed a malicious user to execute arbitrary PHP code. This was possible with a "redacteur" (editor) access level to the site.
- **Unauthenticated Information Access:** A separate vulnerability allowed unauthorized, unauthenticated access to information related to editorial objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to full control of the web server.
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to editorial information could compromise sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The arbitrary code execution vulnerability is triggered through the document addition form using a deprecated gallery feature.
- The information disclosure vulnerability allows unauthenticated access to editorial objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For arbitrary code execution, an attacker needs a "redacteur" (editor) account.
- The information disclosure vulnerability doesn't require authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code related to gallery insertion was deprecated and has been disabled by default (needs to be explicitly enabled by defining `medias_deprecated_liste_galeries`).
- The vulnerability was reported by "g0uZ".
- Patches have been released in SPIP versions 4.0.5 and 3.2.14.
- The issue affects older versions of SPIP, including those on Debian 9 (stretch), Debian 10 (buster), and Debian 11 (bullseye), which were addressed in security updates.
