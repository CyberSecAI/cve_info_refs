{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to improper handling of NVRAM variable sizes within the PEI phase.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper buffer restriction",
        "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution during the PEI phase, potentially leading to:\n\t- Bypassing of mitigations\n\t- Disclosure of physical memory contents\n\t- Discovery of secrets from virtual machines\n\t- Bypassing of memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries\n\t- Injection of a payload into SMRAM memory",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'SaSetup' and 'CpuSetup' NVRAM variables, which can be modified using the efivar tool before rebooting the system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs privileged access to modify NVRAM variables and reboot the system"
