# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1490

## Open Automation Software Platform Engine cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability

##### May 25, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26077

### Summary

A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists in the OAS Engine configuration communications functionality of Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112. A targeted network sniffing attack can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112

### Product URLs

OAS Platform - <https://openautomationsoftware.com/knowledge-base/getting-started-with-oas/>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

### Details

The OAS Platform was built to facilitate the simplified transfer of data between various proprietary devices and applications. It can be used to connect products from multiple different vendors, connect a product to a custom application, and more.

By default all configuration communication with the OAS Platform is sent in cleartext over TCP/58727. Some configuration commands such as `SecureTransferFiles` require an OAS User account in an authorized OAS Security Group. When a command with this requirement, or any request from a logged-in OAS Configuration Utility, is sent, the username and base64 password hash is included in the message. If an attacker is sniffing the network during this time it would be possible to extract this information and subsequently use it to successfully send additional configuration commands that require credentials.

A `SecureTransferFiles` message showing these credentials resembles the following:

```
### Mitigation

The easiest way to mitigate attempts to exploit this vulnerability is to ensure that proper network segmentation is in place such that an attacker has the smallest possible access to the network on which the OAS Platform communicates. Additionally use a dedicated user account to run the OAS Platform, and ensure that user account does not have any more permissions than absolutely necessary.
