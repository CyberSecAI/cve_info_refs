- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Open Automation Software (OAS) Platform transmits sensitive information, including usernames and base64 encoded password hashes, in cleartext over TCP port 58727 during configuration communications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can sniff network traffic to extract usernames and password hashes. This information can then be used to send additional configuration commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the OAS platform.
- **Attack vectors**: Network sniffing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to sniff traffic between the OAS Platform and other devices or applications.
