- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The a+HRD application has insufficient access control on a specific URL, allowing unauthorized access to system API functionalities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control, lack of proper authentication checks for API endpoints.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms to upload and execute malicious scripts. This can lead to system compromise or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access to a specific, vulnerable URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system. No authentication is required due to the broken access control.
