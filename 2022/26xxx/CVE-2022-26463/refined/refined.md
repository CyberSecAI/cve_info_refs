- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `vow` component leads to an out-of-bounds read due to an incorrect bounds check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local information disclosure. An attacker with system execution privileges can read memory beyond the intended boundaries.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a local process, no user interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs system execution privileges on the target device.
