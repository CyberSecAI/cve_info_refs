  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `txn_test_gen_plugin` attempts to read the token contract ABI file from disk, and fails due to an assumption that the software was built from source, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow when the file is not found or cannot be accessed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
      "Incorrect assumption about the location of necessary files (token contract ABI)",

      "Sending a request to create test accounts via the HTTP API endpoint `/v1/txn_test_gen/create_test_accounts`"

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the `/v1/txn_test_gen/create_test_accounts` endpoint of a node running the vulnerable version of `eosio` with the `txn_test_gen_plugin` enabled. This typically requires network access to the node's HTTP server."
