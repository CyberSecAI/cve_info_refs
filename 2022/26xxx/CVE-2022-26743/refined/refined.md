- **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the macOS kernel.
- **Weaknesses:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking, allowing for out-of-bounds writes.
- **Impact:** An attacker who has already achieved code execution in macOS Recovery could exploit this vulnerability to escalate to kernel privileges.
- **Attack vector:** The attacker must already have achieved code execution in macOS Recovery.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Code execution in macOS Recovery.
