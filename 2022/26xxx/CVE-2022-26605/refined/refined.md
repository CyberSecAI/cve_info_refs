{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows a user to upload a file and generates a key based on the file path. This key can then be modified to point to an arbitrary file path, leading to arbitrary file download when the modified key is used for accessing the file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary File Download, insecure key generation, path manipulation",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download any file from the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the avatar upload functionality. First, a legitimate file is uploaded to obtain a key based on the file path. This key is then manipulated to point to a different, arbitrary file. Then using the manipulated key, the arbitrary file is downloaded.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a valid account in the application to access the avatar upload feature."
