 condition in typeref acquisition

Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-26362 / XSA-401
                               version 2

             x86 pv: Race condition in typeref acquisition

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Update 4.16 and 4.15 baselines.

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Xen maintains a type reference count for pages, in addition to a regular
reference count.  This scheme is used to maintain invariants required
for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to
pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen.

Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type reference has a race
condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early and creates a
window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mapping before
writeability is prohibited.

IMPACT
======

Malicious x86 PV guest administrators may be able to escalate privilege
so as to control the whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can trigger this vulnerability.

To exploit the vulnerability, there needs to be an undue delay at just
the wrong moment in _get_page_type().  The degree to which an x86 PV
guest can practically control this race condition is unknown.

MITIGATION
==========

Not running x86 PV guests will avoid the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

                 CVE-2022-29900

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor, which
could result in privilege escalation. In addition this updates provides
mitigations for the "Retbleed" speculative execution attack and the
"MMIO stale data" vulnerabilities.

For additional information please refer to the following pages:
<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-404.html>
<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-407.html>

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.14.5+24-g87d90d511c-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-26362 / XSA-401
                               version 2

             x86 pv: Race condition in typeref acquisition

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Update 4.16 and 4.15 baselines.

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Xen maintains a type reference count for pages, in addition to a regular
reference count.  This scheme is used to maintain invariants required
for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to
pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen.

Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type reference has a race
condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early and creates a
window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mapping before
writeability is prohibited.

IMPACT
======

Malicious x86 PV guest administrators may be able to escalate privilege
so as to control the whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can trigger this vulnerability.

To exploit the vulnerability, there needs to be an undue delay at just
the wrong moment in _get_page_type().  The degree to which an x86 PV
guest can practically control this race condition is unknown.

MITIGATION
==========

Not running x86 PV guests will avoid the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
