The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Poly EagleEye Director II, including CVE-2022-26479.

**CVE-2022-26479: Authentication Bypass**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device has an undocumented authentication bypass. By creating a specific file ("/data/local/tmp/runAutomationFlag") on the filesystem, every API call is executed as admin without any further authentication or session ID checks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Authentication bypass due to a hidden feature that disables cookie checks, an rsync backdoor account with hardcoded credentials
*   **Impact of exploitation:** This allows an attacker to execute privileged commands on the device without authentication.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages a backdoor rsync account to create a specific file on the file system, which then allows them to bypass authentication when interacting with the API
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device to use the rsync backdoor, which is running on port 873. After creating the bypass file, they can make unauthenticated API calls.
