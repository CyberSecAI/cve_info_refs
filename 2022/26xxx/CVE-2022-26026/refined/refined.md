- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OAS Platform allows unauthenticated configuration messages to change the port used for configuration changes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Missing authentication for critical function (CWE-306). The `SecureConfigValues` command can be used without authentication to modify the TCP port.
    - Improper input validation: The application does not validate the new port value correctly. Specifically, it allows invalid port numbers (greater than 65535) or ports already in use to be set via `SecureConfigValues` command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack results in a denial of service. If an invalid port is set, the OAS Platform will stop listening for new configuration connections, making it impossible to manage or interact with the server through the configuration interface.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted network request sent to the OAS Platform's configuration port (TCP/58727 by default) can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the configuration port of the target system. No prior authentication is required.
