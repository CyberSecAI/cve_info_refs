Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-26514:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries within the `DIAE_tagHandler.ashx` component.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The application fails to neutralize or sanitize special elements used in SQL commands, leading to blind SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to the retrieval and modification of database contents.
*   The attacker can potentially execute system commands on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and has a low complexity (AC:L).
*   The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker can be remote.
*   No specific capabilities are mentioned besides the ability to send network requests.

**Affected Component:**
*   The specific vulnerable component is `DIAE_tagHandler.ashx`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 with a vector string of `(AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)`.
*   The document mentions the affected product as Delta Electronics DIAEnergie versions prior to 1.9.
*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities identified in the Delta Electronics DIAEnergie product, with multiple SQL injection points reported.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to version 1.9 or later to address the vulnerability.

This information aligns with the common understanding of SQL injection vulnerabilities, as an attacker can manipulate database queries to their advantage due to the lack of proper input validation.
