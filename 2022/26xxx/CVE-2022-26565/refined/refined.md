- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating page names, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code. Specifically, the page name field was vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page name. When a user (e.g., an administrator viewing the page list) navigates to the page or views the list, the injected script will execute in their browser. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or performing other unauthorized actions within the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the application's interface for creating a new page. The attacker needs to have access to the CMS to create pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create new pages, which in this case was the administrator.
