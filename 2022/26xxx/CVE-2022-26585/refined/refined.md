Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `categoryId` parameter of the `/cms/content/list` route.
*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `${}` instead of `#{} `in the MyBatis framework within the SQL query: `select id FROM cms_category where find_in_set('${categoryId}',CATEGORY_PARENT_IDS)>0`.
*   This allows for direct injection of SQL code into the query because the value of `categoryId` is directly concatenated into the SQL string without any sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries, leading to SQL injection. The application uses string interpolation in the SQL query, which is inherently vulnerable.
*   **Insecure use of MyBatis:** The application uses MyBatis framework incorrectly by using `${}` in the `find_in_set` method. This allows direct SQL injection, whereas using `#{} ` would have prevented it.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There's no validation or filtering of the `categoryId` parameter before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, as demonstrated by the PoC which can retrieve database user information.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Beyond reading data, attackers can modify or delete data in the database, including potentially user data, content, or other system information.
*   **Potential for Complete Compromise:** Depending on database privileges, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the database server, leading to broader system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/cms/content/list` route.
*   **URL Parameter:** The `categoryId` parameter in the request body is used to inject SQL code.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates that the vulnerability can be exploited without needing any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP Client:** The attacker needs to use an HTTP client or similar tool to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Mingsoft MCMS versions up to and including 5.2.7.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `net/mingsoft/cms/action/ContentAction.java`, specifically, the query is performed by IContentBiz.query(), which uses the vulnerable SQL statement in the mapping file `IContentDao.xml`.
*   The provided PoC confirms the vulnerability, successfully extracting database information.

**Mitigation:**

*   The provided fix suggestions include using `foreach` along with `#` in mybatis and also implementation of an SQL filter for validating and filtering the parameters.
