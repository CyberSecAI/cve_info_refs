  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2022-26496",
      "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `handle_info` function of `nbd-server.c` due to insufficient bounds checking on the `len` and `namelen` fields.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
         "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution by overflowing the stack buffer.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a crafted `NBD_OPT_INFO` or `NBD_OPT_GO` request with a malformed `len` field after the initial protocol negotiation.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to establish a network connection to the NBD server and send malicious NBD requests. No prior authentication is needed."

       "cve": "CVE-2022-26496",
      "root_cause": "A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the `handle_info` and `handle_export_name` functions of `nbd-server.c` due to improper handling of the `namelen` field.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Integer overflow leading to small memory allocation",
        "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution by overflowing the heap buffer. When namelen is -1, it results in a small memory allocation but socket_read reads a large value leading to heap overflow",
