The provided content is related to CVE-2022-26082.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `SecureTransferFiles` functionality within the Open Automation Software (OAS) Platform, which lacks proper authentication for critical file transfer operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authentication for the `SecureTransferFiles` function, allowing arbitrary file uploads.
- File write vulnerability that allows uploading files to any location accessible by the `oasuser`.
- Insecure file transfer protocol where credentials can be sniffed from the network and reused for exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution through arbitrary file upload.
- Full control of the system by creating new authorized keys and using SSH.
- Potential access and manipulation of industrial control system (ICS) data/processes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack by sending a series of crafted configuration messages to TCP port 58727.
- Exploitation of the insecure file transfer protocol by sniffing network traffic for credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the OAS Platform's configuration port (TCP/58727).
- Ability to sniff credentials from network traffic, if existing Security Group and User Account are in place.
- Otherwise, the attacker needs to create a Security Group and User Account within the OAS Platform before exploitation.
