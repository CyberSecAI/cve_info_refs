# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1493

## Open Automation Software Platform Engine SecureTransferFiles file write vulnerability

##### May 25, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26082

### Summary

A file write vulnerability exists in the OAS Engine SecureTransferFiles functionality of Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112. A specially-crafted series of network requests can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112

### Product URLs

OAS Platform - <https://openautomationsoftware.com/knowledge-base/getting-started-with-oas/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-306 - Missing Authentication for Critical Function

### Details

The OAS Platform was built to facilitate the simplified transfer of data between various proprietary devices and applications. It can be used to connect products from multiple different vendors, connect a product to a custom application, and more. Configuration of the platform is possible through TCP/58727 by default.

By sending a series of properly-formatted configuration messages to the OAS Platform, it is possible to upload an arbitrary file to any location permissible by the underlying user. By default these messages can be sent to TCP/58727 and, if successful, will be processed by the user `oasuser` with normal user permissions.

Before the transfer of a file will be accepted, it is necessary that a Security Group with File Transfer permissions and a User Account in that group exist. Both the Security Group and the User Account referred to here are elements within the OAS Platform, not on the underlying Linux machine. If an acceptable Security Group and User Account already exist, the necessary credentials can be sniffed off the network and used for the transfer. If they do not exist, they would need to be created before exploitation would be possible.

Once the required Security Group and User Account credentials have been obtained, a file of choice can be uploaded to the underlying linux machine at any path permissible by the user owning the `oas-engine` service, through use of the `SecureTransferFiles` command accompanied with the newly created (or sniffed) credentials. A valid `SecureTransferFiles` command resembles the following:

```

When a successful `SecureTransferFiles` command is received, a response similar to the following will be returned:

```
0000   00 00 00 00 00 80 44 40 00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff   ......D@........
0010   ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 01 00 00 00 02 00   ................
0020   00 00 06 02 00 00 00 07 53 75 63 63 65 73 73 0a   ........Success.
0030   0b                                                .

```

With file upload functionality successful, various approaches can be taken to get access to the system. The proof-of-concept here uploads a new `authorized_keys` file to the `oasuser`’s `.ssh` directory, after which it is possible to gain access to the system via a ssh command like the following: `ssh -i id_rsa oasuser@192.168.1.10`

### Mitigation

The easiest way to mitigate attempts to exploit this vulnerability is to prevent access to the configuration port (TCP/58727 by default) when not actively configuring the OAS Platform. Additionally, use a dedicated user account to run the OAS Platform and ensure that user account does not have any more permissions than absolutely necessary.
