Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-26062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Uncontrolled search path element.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector, before version 2021.6, does not properly control the search path it uses to locate resources or libraries. This could allow an attacker to introduce malicious files in locations that are searched by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Escalation of privilege, meaning an attacker could gain higher-level access or permissions on the system than they should have. This could potentially lead to complete system compromise if the attacker can execute malicious code with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access. An attacker would need to have some form of existing access to the system, either through a compromised user account or by being able to execute code through other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be authenticated, meaning they must have valid credentials on the system.
*   The attacker must also be able to influence the application's search path, most likely by controlling files in the user's path. This likely involves the ability to write files to a location where the application looks for resources/libraries.
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to perform some action (UI:R), which could be running the vulnerable software.
