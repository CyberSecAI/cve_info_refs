Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26704:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a validation issue in how macOS Spotlight handles symlinks during the indexing process. Specifically, Spotlight's indexing process, managed by `mds` and `mds_stores`, uses open system calls that follow symlinks. Additionally, the macOS sandbox does not properly detect hard linked files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper symlink handling: The Spotlight indexing process does not adequately validate symlinks, allowing them to be followed during file creation and management.
- Lack of hard link awareness: The macOS sandbox policies do not account for hard linked files, allowing them to bypass intended security measures.
-  Open system calls that follow symbolic links

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file overwrite as root: An attacker can exploit the symlink following to overwrite arbitrary files as root.
- Privilege escalation: By overwriting critical system files, an attacker with local unprivileged access can gain root-level privileges.
- Modification of protected parts of the filesystem: As a result of the file overwrite, protected parts of the file system could be modified.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- Exploitation of Spotlight indexing: The attacker exploits the way Spotlight indexes files, which automatically indexes archives and drives.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user privileges: The attacker must have a valid user account on the target macOS system.
- Ability to create symbolic links and hard links.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Apple's security updates released on July 20, 2022.
- The vulnerability is also present in macOS Catalina and Big Sur
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:L/IR:L/AR:L.
