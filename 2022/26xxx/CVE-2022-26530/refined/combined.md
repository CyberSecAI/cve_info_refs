### @emersion **[emersion](/emersion)** commented [Dec 20, 2021](#issue-1084980569) • edited Loading

This is a new protocol to lock the session [1](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/131). It should be more

reliable than layer-shell + input-inhibitor.

* Bump wayland-protocols dep version

To build locally:

```
mkdir subprojects
git clone "git@gitlab.freedesktop.org:ifreund/wayland-protocols.git" -b ext-lock-v1 subprojects/wayland-protocols
meson configure build/ --force-fallback-for=wayland-protocols
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

Works for me with the `ext-session-lock-v1` implementation in river here [riverwm/river#497](https://github.com/riverwm/river/pull/497) and the `wl_surface_commit()` call mentioned below removed when using `ext-session-lock-v1`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
