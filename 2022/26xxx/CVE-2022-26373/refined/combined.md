### Summary:

A potential security vulnerability in some Intel® Processors may allow information disclosure.Intel is releasing prescriptive guidance to address this potential vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID:  [CVE-2022-26373](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26373)

Description: Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

CVSS Base Score: 5.5 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Root Cause Summary:  Hardware structures shared across execution contexts (return predictor targets) can violate the expected architecture isolation between contexts.

### Affected Products:

Some Intel® Processors, consult this list of affected products [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html).

### Recommendations:

Intel documents indirect branch prediction target isolation properties as part of the Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) and Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier (IBPB) capabilities.  On some processors, two cases have been identified that do not fully isolate targets used for RET prediction.  In one case, the address following the most recent CALL before an IBPB may be used under certain circumstances as the predicted target of a RET executed after the barrier. Since an attacker will generally not control the last CALL instruction executed before the IBPB, Intel does not believe that any typical usage of IBPB will require mitigation for this issue.

In the second case, the address following the most recent CALL in guest mode before a VM exit event may be used under certain circumstances as the predicted target of a RET executed in the host.  This may be true even when eIBRS is employed.  Some VMM software may not be affected, or may already be executing an “RSB stuffing” sequence after VM exit. In other situations, Intel has worked with VMM vendors to create a software mitigation sequence to be used after VM exit where applicable. Intel recommends that affected Intel® Processors that use a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), should check with their VMM vendor to determine the status of the fix.

Please refer to technical paper [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html) for additional Post-barrier RSB prediction recommendation.

### Acknowledgements:

The following issues were found internally by Intel employees.  Intel would like to thank Pawan Kumar Gupta, Alyssa Milburn, Amit Peled, Shani Rehana, Nir Shildan and Ariel Sabba.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.

Debian Bug     : 1018752

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-4159

    A flaw was found in the eBPF verifier which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read.  If unprivileged use of eBPF is enabled, this
    could leak sensitive information.  This was already disabled by
    default, which would fully mitigate the vulnerability.

CVE-2021-33655

    A user with access to a framebuffer console device could cause a
    memory out-of-bounds write via the FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO ioctl.

CVE-2021-33656

    A user with access to a framebuffer console device could cause a
    memory out-of-bounds write via some font setting ioctls.  These
    obsolete ioctls have been removed.

CVE-2022-1462

    一只狗 reported a race condition in the pty (pseudo-terminal)
    subsystem that can lead to a slab out-of-bounds write.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1679

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the ath9k_htc driver
    which can lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to
    cause a denial service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2153

    "kangel" reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
    user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-2318

    A use-after-free in the Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose) support may
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-2586

    A use-after-free in the Netfilter subsystem may result in local
    privilege escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2588

    Zhenpeng Lin discovered a use-after-free flaw in the cls_route
    filter implementation which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2663

    David Leadbeater reported flaws in the nf_conntrack_irc
    connection-tracking protocol module.  When this module is enabled
    on a firewall, an external user on the same IRC network as an
    internal user could exploit its lax parsing to open arbitrary TCP
    ports in the firewall, to reveal their public IP address, or to
    block their IRC connection at the firewall.

CVE-2022-3028

    Abhishek Shah reported a race condition in the AF_KEY subsystem,
    which could lead to an out-of-bounds write or read.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption), to obtain sensitive information, or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740, CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742

    Roger Pau Monne discovered that Xen block and network PV device
    frontends don't zero out memory regions before sharing them with
    the backend, which may result in information disclosure.
    Additionally it was discovered that the granularity of the grant
    table doesn't permit sharing less than a 4k page, which may also
    result in information disclosure.

CVE-2022-26373

    It was discovered that on certain processors with Intel's Enhanced
    Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities there
    are exceptions to the documented properties in some situations,
    which may result in information disclosure.

    Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html>

CVE-2022-33744

    Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that ARM Xen guests can cause a
    denial of service to the Dom0 via paravirtual devices.

CVE-2022-36879

    A flaw was discovered in xfrm_expand_policies in the xfrm
    subsystem which can cause a reference count to be dropped twice.

CVE-2022-36946

    Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera reported a memory
    corruption flaw in the Netfilter subsystem which may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2022-39188

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the kernel's handling of
    unmapping of certain memory ranges.  When a driver created a
    memory mapping with the VM_PFNMAP flag, which many GPU drivers do,
    the memory mapping could be removed and freed before it was
    flushed from the CPU TLBs.  This could result in a page use-after-
    free.  A local user with access to such a device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-39842

    An integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver
    which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-40307

    A race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,
    which could lead to use-after-free.  A local user permitted to
    access this device (/dev/efi_capsule_loader) could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.  However, this device is normally only
    accessible by the root user.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.260-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Package        : linux-5.10
Version        : 5.10.136-1~deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2585 CVE-2022-2586 CVE-2022-2588 CVE-2022-26373
                 CVE-2022-29900 CVE-2022-29901 CVE-2022-36879 CVE-2022-36946

Linux 5.10 has been packaged for Debian 10 as linux-5.10.  This
provides a supported upgrade path for systems that currently use
kernel packages from the "buster-backports" suite.

There is no need to upgrade systems using Linux 4.19, as that kernel
version will also continue to be supported in the LTS period.

The "apt full-upgrade" command will *not* automatically install the
updated kernel packages.  You should explicitly install one of the
following metapackages first, as appropriate for your system:

    linux-image-5.10-686
    linux-image-5.10-686-pae
    linux-image-5.10-amd64
    linux-image-5.10-arm64
    linux-image-5.10-armmp
    linux-image-5.10-armmp-lpae
    linux-image-5.10-cloud-amd64
    linux-image-5.10-cloud-arm64
    linux-image-5.10-rt-686-pae
    linux-image-5.10-rt-amd64
    linux-image-5.10-rt-arm64
    linux-image-5.10-rt-armmp

For example, if the command "uname -r" currently shows
"5.10.0-0.deb10.16-amd64", you should install linux-image-5.10-amd64.

This backport does not include the following binary packages:

    bpftool hyperv-daemons libcpupower-dev libcpupower1
    linux-compiler-gcc-8-arm linux-compiler-gcc-8-x86 linux-cpupower
    linux-libc-dev usbip

Older versions of most of those are built from the linux source
package in Debian 10.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-2585

    A use-after-free flaw in the implementation of POSIX CPU timers
    may result in denial of service or in local privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2586

    A use-after-free in the Netfilter subsystem may result in local
    privilege escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2588

    Zhenpeng Lin discovered a use-after-free flaw in the cls_route
    filter implementation which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-26373

    It was discovered that on certain processors with Intel's Enhanced
    Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities there
    are exceptions to the documented properties in some situations,
    which may result in information disclosure.

    Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html>

CVE-2022-29900

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for AMD/Hygon
    processors, mis-trained branch predictions for return instructions
    may allow arbitrary speculative code execution under certain
    microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    A list of affected AMD CPU types can be found at
    <https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1037>

CVE-2022-29901

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel
    processors (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against
    speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in
    some circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code
    execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    More information can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>

CVE-2022-36879

    A flaw was discovered in xfrm_expand_policies in the xfrm
    subsystem which can cause a reference count to be dropped twice.

CVE-2022-36946

    Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera reported a memory
    corruption flaw in the Netfilter subsystem which may result in
    denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.136-1~deb10u3. This update additionally includes many more bug
fixes from stable updates 5.10.128-5.10.136 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.
