Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-26373 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts in some Intel processors. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the fact that hardware structures shared across execution contexts (return predictor targets) can violate the expected architectural isolation between contexts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The return stack buffer (RSB) predictions are not fully isolated in certain scenarios on some Intel processors with Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS). This allows the address following the most recent CALL before an IBPB or a VM exit event to be used as the predicted target of a RET executed after the barrier or in the host.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required for exploitation. An authorized user on the system could potentially trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user authorized to execute code on the affected system.
*   For the specific case regarding VM exits, the attacker needs to be a guest user within a virtual machine.
*   The attacker does not need any specific user interface interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how the return predictor works with Intel's eIBRS capabilities and IBPB.
*   Intel's advisory (INTEL-SA-00706) provides more technical details and guidance.
*   A software mitigation may be needed in VMM software to ensure proper isolation of return targets.
*   NetApp has investigated the vulnerability and determined that none of their products are affected.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.5.

**Summary of different documents:**

*   **NetApp Advisory:** States that no NetApp products are affected. Describes the vulnerability and its potential impact and references the Intel advisory.
*   **Intel Advisory (INTEL-SA-00706):** Provides in-depth technical details about the vulnerability, affected processors, and mitigation recommendations, particularly focusing on software mitigations for Virtual Machine Managers (VMMs).
* **Debian Security Advisories:**
    * DLA 3131-1: Mentions CVE-2022-26373 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in a Linux kernel update for Debian 10 (buster). This advisory states the vulnerability can cause information disclosure and references the Intel advisory.
    * DLA 3102-1: Mentions CVE-2022-26373 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the linux-5.10 kernel package for Debian 10, and that it may result in information disclosure. It also references the Intel advisory.
