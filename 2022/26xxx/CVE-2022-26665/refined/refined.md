Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2022-26665:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-26665. While the CVE description is a placeholder, the provided context describes a security flaw in the Tyler Technologies Odyssey Portal software, which allowed unauthorized access to confidential records. This aligns with the general understanding of a security vulnerability leading to data exposure.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Lack of Access Control:** The core issue is that the Tyler Technologies Odyssey Portal did not perform proper access control checks before returning case data. Direct case access URLs could retrieve both public and non-public records without verifying user authorization.
*   **Direct Case Access:** The system allowed direct access to case data via URLs, without any checks if the user was authorized to view the requested data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The most critical weakness was the absence of authorization checks for direct case access URLs.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References:**  The system used direct object references (case IDs in URLs) without verifying if the user was authorized to access the resource.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Confidential Data:** The vulnerability exposed non-public case records, including attorney discipline records, personal information related to mental health and substance abuse, witness and complainant names, etc.
*   **Data Leakage:**  Sensitive data was accessible to unauthorized parties through a public website (judyrecords.com) and even indexed by search engines like Google.
*   **Privacy Violation:**  The exposure of confidential records led to a significant privacy breach for those involved in the cases.
*   **System Downtime:** The vulnerability forced Tyler Technologies to take their portals offline across the country to fix it.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker could directly access case details by manipulating URLs with sequential or known case IDs.
*   **Data Scraping:** The judyrecords.com website used automated scraping methods to collect data from various court portals, which included non-public records due to the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Knowledge of HTTP Requests:** An attacker would need basic knowledge to craft HTTP requests with case IDs or to scrape data.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:**  The vulnerability did not require any special privileges, making it accessible to any user who could craft the appropriate HTTP requests.
*   **Publicly Accessible Interface:** The vulnerability was exploitable through the publicly accessible Odyssey portal interface.
*   **Knowledge of Case ID Structure** While not strictly necessary, knowing how case IDs were structured may have allowed for more effective data scraping.
