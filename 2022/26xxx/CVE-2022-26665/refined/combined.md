# What Happened With Tyler Technologies

First off, thanks for taking the time to read this.
If you're here, you're probably already familiar with what's happened.
If not, check out [here](/info).

If you're already familiar with all that or aren't interested in reading through it, here's the setup:
   — Sat, Feb 26th around 7pm, California State Bar puts out the press release [here](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/state-bar-of-california-addresses-breach-of-confidential-data) (updates [here](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/Data-Breach-Updates)),
announcing that it is taking urgent action against a breach and unlawful display of 260,000 nonpublic State Bar attorney discipline records. Forensics experts have been retained, law enforcement has been contacted, the software vendor has been contacted, my domain registrar and web host have been notified.
   — Sat, Feb 26th around 7:30pm, news websites begin picking up the story, the first of which I saw [here](https://www.pe.com/2022/02/26/260000-confidential-attorney-discipline-records-published-after-data-breach-state-bar-says/),
and the corresponding tweets [here](https://twitter.com/TheChalkOutline/status/1497769824474128386)
and [here](https://twitter.com/TheChalkOutline/status/1497791192049717248), hashtag #hackers on each.

 And I run judyrecords.
 Holy. Shit.

I see these around 11pm, along with several other news websites already picking up the story, immediately stop browsing reddit, and start rifling through a temp file for the closest thing that could delete
the CA State Bar cases off the index.

### Meeting With California State Bar. Monday Morning.

The night I learned of the issue, I'd immediately called out the CA State Bar saying that all the records accessed were publicly available (confidential & non-confidential).
 By Monday morning, however, the story had already hit local and national media.
 [And](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-02-27/california-bar-investigates-possible-data-breach-after-discipline-records-published-online)
[I](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/california-bar-says-hack-exposed-1000s-attorney-discipline-cases-2022-02-28/)
[was](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/california-bar-disciplinary-lawyer-data-hack-under-investigation)
[a](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-bar-investigates-confidential-discipline-220622886.html)
[hacker](https://today.westlaw.com/Document/I73bd192098c311ec89d6c95015d2aa50/View/FullText.html?transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
 In what can only be described as simultaneously the most bizarre *and* unbizzare meeting I have ever had, by the time the Monday morning meeting arrived,
everyone already knew what the problem was. Direct case access did not perform any access control check before returning case data.
 Holy. Fucking. Shit.
 It's one of those things that almost doesn't compute, honestly.
A security measure so fundamental, and without which the system can't even be called secure.
There's no buildup or grand reveal on the technical side of things, if you were hoping for one.
 You might be wondering then, what's the most reliable way to size this up? What information available would have the highest liklihood of accurately reflecting what is actually true?
 And I would simply suggest looking at what happened in the following days.
 Tyler starts taking their portals offline accross the county.
I disable the search on judyrecords, and disable all Tyler Technologies cases from direct access.
 Silence.

### The Great Retraction

Given the severity of the software defect, I'd like to think it was an entirely foregone conclusion about what the
Bar's response would be after the initial meeting.
 The California State Bar released the following statement that same day:

The State Bar has continued its investigation with the help of an IT security firm, and has also been in contact with the owner of the judyrecords site, who has been very responsive and collaborative. It is now the State Bar’s belief that there was no malicious “hack” of its system. Instead, it appears that a previously unknown security vulnerability in the Tyler Technologies Odyssey case management portal allowed the nonpublic records to be unintentionally swept up by judyrecords when they attempted to access the public records, using a unique access method. The State Bar is working with Tyler Technologies, the maker of the Odyssey system, to remediate the security vulnerability, which we believe may not be unique to the State Bar’s implementation and could impact other users of Odyssey systems.

 Within the span of 48 hours, I had metamorphisized from an ordinary citizen to a hacker. And to an ordinary citizen, once more.
 The least biased reporting I've found up to this point [here](https://followourcourts.com/2022/02/state-bar-case-website-exchange-allegations-over-data-illegally-made-public/).

### Requests, Requests, Requests

At this point, you're undoubtedly wondering about this "unique access method" described above.
Any funny business going on there?
 The short answer, is yes.
 But only from the court systems themselves, actually, not from me.
 Broadly speaking, there are 2 kinds of public data systems:
   (1) Public data systems that make their public data available and accessible.
   (2) Public data systems that make their public data available and accessible, while simultaneously and intentionally errecting barriers that make simple and straightforward access difficult.
[Two-faced](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/two-faced) systems, if you will.

 Seriously, take a look at these URLs.
 Go ahead, open some new tabs, and check them out. By the way, I mean the URLs themselves, not the pages.
 And what do they all have in common?
 They all present simple and straightforward mechanisms to access data.
 Public records portals allowing simple and straigtforward access to public records. Great!
 And Type 2 systems?
 Well, in Type 2 systems you have garbage like this:

  — /CV\_CaseInformation\_Summary.aspx?q=H7NlDikRRhKJF5LgUOpm6Q2
   — /Case/CaseDetail?eid=cntgXDLsxsfSNXmdnHGDvA2
   — /webcivil/FCASCaseInfo?index=m9hvMsrh7eR0g7Hq0FHhMA%3D%3D&county=EI3JYjjXFaKuMnnvdD2LYA%3D%3D&civilCaseId=yRBmzd3Mtkanyl9QS4lgsg%3D%3D

 What. The. Fuck.
 This is from organizations that are in *the same class of entity* as the Type 1 systems and URLs given above.
Each of the URLs directly above, with *less* effort, could have been:

  — /CV\_CaseInformation\_Summary.aspx?CaseId=500
   — /Case/CaseDetail?CaseId=500
   — /webcivil/FCASCaseInfo?index=5&county=2&civilCaseId=500

 But the programmers of these systems went out of their way to intentionally create barriers that make simple and straightforward access to public records difficult.
 In each of the cases above, a level of indirection was added to make the collection of public records as difficult as possible.
 This is a common anti-scraping technique, which is justifiable for those with proprietary data that aren't funded by taxpayer dollars, but has no place among publicly-funded public records systems.

judyrecords, YouTube, and others use this same technique, in fact. See
[here](https://judyrecords.com/record/vz3qd3xny6ba2)
and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

 But wait, more Type 2 public records systems glory!
 In addition to the above scheme, you also see garbage like this:
   (1) Date filed searches are arbitrarily restricted, preventing the ability to simply query all cases filed within (even a small) date range and get all the cases.
   (2) Want to get an update to a case or download a public case document? Fill out a captcha first to request the case URL.
   (3) Want to get all the cases of a type, filed within a certain date range? First specify at least 2 characters of the last name, and one first name character.
 I've just checked 10 random Odyssey Portals and not a single one allows doing a simple date filed search.
Each one requires that additional information be supplied.
 Are you seeing a pattern here?
 In terms of public records access, this is intentionally antagonistic.

### Records Wide Open

Tyler, as it happens, sells Type 2 public records systems.
They've implemented every single tactic mentioned above to varying degrees across their portals.
 Honestly, you just deal with it.
 These systems and the people who sign off on them certainly have a special place in public records hell, but you take
what you can get, and move on.
 I'd pulled data from about 20 of Tyler's Odyssey Portals from jurisdictions around the country. California, Georgia,
Texas, and so on, marshalling through searches, farming out the captcha solving to a third-party service when needed.
 Another day in public records aggregation paradise.
 In Tyler's Odyssey Portal, cases could be requested directly, no need to jump through hoops for that part.
More often than not, cases can be requested directly, but sometimes you have to do a search first, sometimes you need to fill out a captcha, etc.
It depends on how far Type 2 they've made the system, but in this case, direct requests were available.
 So, remember that first set of garbage URLs from Type 2 systems above?
 The second one was actually one of Tyler's, corresponding to whatever case ID.
 I remember looking at the [table](/public-uploads/tyler-urls-1.png) of a portal I'd already pulled from, and thinking:

Huh, maybe they're using the same URLs for the same case IDs?

 And it turns out, they
[were](/public-uploads/tyler-urls-2.png).
 At this point, it's just a matter of marching through case IDs, as usual.
 If you've followed all the way through to this point, you might've figured out what went wrong.
 Tyler went out of their way to implement Type 2 measures, intentionally requiring convoluted access approaches
by their own design, but didn't bother with basic security.
 Did I ever think a direct case request could lead to private records?
 Not in a million years.
 Because that would mean the software had a defect so severe that any and all systems running that software
would need to be taken offline immediately, due to its inability to perform arguably its most critical function.
 Well, that [happened](https://www.law360.com/articles/1470532/court-files-offline-in-several-states-after-security-flaw-found).
 And I downloaded from about 30 different Tyler Odyssey portals this way.
 The California State Bar times 30 — potentially.

### It Gets Worse

There's an old Internet adage:

On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.

 Tyler's software didn't know either.
 If you had a link, you were a fully authorized user — tail or otherwise.
 I pointed out early on that this isn't just a judyrecords problem.
 If these links are not performing access control checks, if a case is found by a
docket aggregator, and then goes private and has updates, those updates that happened
after the case became private are still public and subject to be downloaded.
 That would seem to be a large and widespread problem, but simply hasn't been noticed yet.
 Docket aggregators have millions of cases from this software system. Probably no less than 10 million on average.
 According to Tyler's own
[spec sheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220318140229/https%3A//www.tylertech.com/Portals/0/OpenContent/Files/3651/ODYSSEY-Portal-Product-Sheet.pdf),
this software system serves more than 600 counties across 22 states — although I believe this counts their legacy Odyssey system as well, which doesn't have the same issue.
 Two days in, I had two asks for Tyler.
 My exact message:

(#1 by Thursday)
 #1. Publicly clarify: Based on Tyler's understanding of the situation, what is Tyler's public position regarding whether it views the incident the same way as the CA Bar or not.
 #2. Willing to budget dedicated internal staff/resources toward helping individual portals get their data up to date on judyrecords \*and\* other docket aggregators.
 Solely from docket aggregators using URLs that, when those URLs become confidential, those URLs are still public to have data updated from (and those URLs having been this way for probably the entirety of the Odyssey case management system's lifetime), that is more than enough for Tyler to reach the same conclusion and start shepherding a unified data fix solution that can be checked and updated by other docket aggregators.
 (other known docket aggregators: DocketAlarm, LexisNexis CourtLink, West's docket product, Bloomberg, UniCourt)

### Type 2 Collaboration And Disbelief

By Thursday of the same week I had initially met with the California State Bar, I had already
shared exactly how I downloaded cases from their portals.
 Some by search first, then direct access. The others just by direct access.
 By Friday, it was great to clear the air. We discussed leveraging the same ability to identify which cases
were actually viewed that the CA State Bar used. That there are far fewer cases intended to be private that
have been viewed vs. the number that have been downloaded is an incredibly tempering circumstance.
 judyrecords had also saved all case identifiers for every case downloaded, which would allow accurate
cross-referencing between systems. I've done this for every system where possible, not just Odyssey.
 A strong point of contention was exactly how data would flow. I wanted data to flow from Tyler to me first,
and Tyler wanted the opposite.
 When data flows from my end first, I have no ability to know what's what, Tyler
can say whatever it wants about the data, and I don't have any basis to know, evaluate, or say anything.
They control the information entirely. My main concern however, was that data flowing from me first would kill
their incentive to collaborate back in kind.
 But by the end of Friday, still in the very first week of it all, I was already sending them data up front.
 I did manage to require that I wouldn't be sending more than 5 sources before they had to send data back before
getting more. But I gave in to the next special request, and the next, and the next. By the middle of the next week,
I had provided 15 data sources up front.
 Then, I went out of my way to create truncated files with actual data for every direct access portal.
10k-record files that could be used for testing, and for any data source for which I haven't given them a full file
for yet.
 But two weeks later, after significant back and forth, and despite the nature of the software defect, they are unwilling
to even say they believe the access to records meant to be nonpublic was inadvertent.
 And I've only received one data file back of nonpublic case IDs to remove.

### Where Do We Go From Here?

As far as removing cases on judyrecords retrieved from Odyssey (non-legacy) portals that were meant to be nonpublic,
I only need a list of case IDs. After that, a confirmation check on a sample of the cases provided, and confirmation
of the records removed.
 As for general cleanup, the only viable solution I see is for Tyler to establish an API on their public records portals
so that docket aggregators can voluntarily synchronize their datasets to remove currently nonpublic cases. This will
have the effect of handling cases that became private, but updates were received after that.
 After that, I seriously hope they'll consider getting rid of Type 2 designs that intentionally errect barriers
that make simple and straightforward access to public records difficult.

### Supplemental Q&A (last updated 7/22)

 Which versions of Odyssey Portal were affected by the direct access issue?
 Tyler has 2 major Odyssey products that I know of. Odyssey "New" (referred to as just Odyssey Portal now) and Odyssey "Old", their legacy
Odyssey system.
 First one looks like [this](https://discipline.calbar.ca.gov/portal/), second like [this](http://ac5.co.anderson.tx.us/PublicAccess/default.aspx).
 I've asked Tyler multiple times.
 I finally caved.
 And just asked: What's the complicated part?
 My exact words:

...confirming whether any portal has a direct access issue should be a straightforward check that could be done by level 1 or level 2 support for any of the portals.
 If you don't mind me asking, what is the complicated part about verifying the authorization issue?
   1) Go to a case in a portal that is supposed to be non-public
   2) Open the web tools network tab and copy the URL for the case
   3) Open another browser and go to the URL. If the URL displays the case, there was no authorization check.
 So right now, my understanding is that any non classic Odyssey Portal had the issue of no authorization check for direct access.

 It's like talking to a brick wall.
 Is sharing the access method or case IDs security sensitive?

Tyler sent [this](/public-uploads/what-happened-with-tyler-technologies-response-2022-03-20.png) 3/19.
Response to #1.

 No, absolutely not.
 First, access method.
 Tyler has already taken their public portals offline across the country.
 If there are any portals that have either
(1) been taken offline then brought back online without fixing the issue
or (2) have the issue but have not been taken offline, that would be extrordinarily incompetent.
 If this is the case, there are even bigger problems with Tyler.
 Second, case IDs or URLs aren't sensitive information in any practical sense. Only the lack of access control
upon those, is what can make them insecure.
 I just checked Washington's Odyssey system, just for the heck of it. Both identifiers exist in the case right now.
See [here](/public-uploads/tyler-washington-case-number-and-url-2022-03-20.png).
 Does that mean the system is insecure? No! It's entirely irrelevant.
 As mentioned previously, judyrecords, YouTube, and others use the *same* type of URLs as Tyler's Odyssey system.
In fact, here's an export of internal case ID mapping to URLs for judyrecords for a currently restricted datasource — 569k cases total!
 [CaseIdPlusUrlMapping-AccessControlDemo.zip](/public-uploads/CaseIdPlusUrlMapping-AccessControlDemo.zip)
 Here's the format:

{"caseId":"1","url":"\/record\/jkhl7e7c"}
{"caseId":"2","url":"\/record\/v2bgn9bd1"}
{"caseId":"3","url":"\/record\/v6lcb2de6"}
{"caseId":"4","url":"\/record\/dh52mb1a9"}
{"caseId":"5","url":"\/record\/dg26f343d"}
...

 These cases were blocked at the beginning of the month. (March)
 Am I any less secure now?
 No.
 I've implemented access control.
 Those cases are for my eyes only.
 It does not matter whether you have the case IDs or URLs.
 Does not fucking matter.
 Tyler not doing this is the exact cause of the current situation.
 Exact fucking cause.
 That Tyler thinks these IDs are security sensitive shows an unbelievable lack of understanding of security,
and of access control specifically.
 Is Tyler Technologies a Type 2 collaborator?

Tyler sent [this](/public-uploads/what-happened-with-tyler-technologies-response-2022-03-20.png) 3/19.
Response to #2.

 From Tyler:

"expect to get you some additional files back within the next couple of days" — 3/9
 "we should be able to turn that around in relatively short order" — 3/9
 "for clarity's sake, we're ready to pull the trigger" — 3/9
 "6 clients that we are actively testing with" — 3/6

 Those are the only timetables I've known about.
 Kinda makes you feel like you're being hung out to dry.
 And a company has a defect in their software so bad, that by the admission of their own
[actions](https://www.law360.com/articles/1470532/court-files-offline-in-several-states-after-security-flaw-found)
is enough to warrant immediately
taking everything offline, but you can't be given the benefit of the doubt of relying on that circumstance
not being true? And if it weren't true, the code would have retrieved exactly the information intended?
 I don't know how you can use the word responsible, not owning up to the issue, then leaving doubt to be cast on me for
this entire clusterfuck.
 Tyler has said that judyrecords needs to provide full data about cases up front, and that this is necessary. Is that true?

Tyler sent [this](/public-uploads/what-happened-with-tyler-technologies-response-2022-03-20.png) 3/19.
Response to #3.

 That's an absolute lie.
 Data in this situation can flow 2 ways and achieve the exact same end result:

  — judyrecords to Tyler
   — Tyler to judyrecords

 There is absolutely nothing in the way of achieving the exact same result when Tyler sends data to judyrecords first.
 How does it look like when data comes from judyrecords first?

  1) judyrecords provides all case IDs to Tyler for a datasource, with supplemental view data
  2) Tyler returns back intersection of case IDs of cases to remove
  3) Done

 How does it look like when data comes from Tyler first?

  1) Tyler provides case IDs to remove
  2) judyrecords returns back intersection case IDs to Tyler, with supplemental view data
  3) Done

 As of 3/26, I've told Tyler I will no longer be providing any data sources upfront, due to their extrordinary
dishonesty and incompetence in the whole situation. Only in return.
 Also see the questions:
 - Is sharing the access method or case IDs security sensitive?
 - Which data sources were provided to Tyler upfront?
 How bad was the defect, 1 to 10?
 Case access is the most critical point to ensure access control.
Everything else is a distant second. Security would easily be the most important [non-functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) requirement of
software handling sensitive information. Easily 10.
 Does Tyler Technologies have a page for this issue?
 Yes, this [page](https://www.tylertech.com/dataharvest) whispered its way onto the Internet about 2 weeks ago.
 Interestingly, it was just updated today. (3/21)
 Earlier version [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220319203703/https%3A//www.tylertech.com/dataharvest).
  How many Odyssey Portal cases meant to be private does judyrecords have?
 At this point, I believe this number is well into the millions.
 These cases have been accessible over roughly the past year.
 Also, this is not considering the "any dog with a link" update issue described in the section "It Gets Worse".
 Where do things stand with the California State Bar?
 While the investigation is considered ongoing, the California State Bar has stated:

The State Bar plans to notify complainants, witnesses, and respondents whose names appeared in the approximately 322,525 confidential records that were available on judyrecords during the period in question, though the current evidence suggests that only 1,034 of those were actually viewed. We continue to investigate this incident and will provide additional details about the notification plan and timeline as soon as possible.

 and

The majority of Cooley’s rates and costs will be covered by the State Bar’s insurance. The State Bar and its carrier intend to pursue reimbursement from Tyler Technologies.

 Updates [here](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/Data-Breach-Updates).
 I'm a CIO of a potentially affected jurisdiction. How can I contact judyrecords?
 You can email me at judyrecordssite@gmail.com.
 I've provided information for numerous portal sites to Tyler upfront.
I'm sure you couldn't care less about that, and I wouldn't either, honestly.
 That said, I have never had any reservations about providing data, except that it will disincentivize returning data in kind.
 Toward that end, the best way to move forward is just to provide a list of case IDs of non-public cases that can be checked against.
After that, I'd be happy to provide all relevant data back about those cases, and remove them.
 Tyler has taken the position that judyrecords not providing data first has held things up somehow. I cannot tell you how
incredibly frustrating and outright dishonest that is.
 I'd be happy to help in this situation. Basically, you need to write a query that will return all non-public cases. Writing this query may not be just
a plain query with a single filter, so it may be necessary to reach out to Tyler technical support to those
who have worked on similar queries already. Obviously, you don't need judyrecords data to make this happen and
move things forward. Two Four Five Six jurisdictions have done so already.
 Which Tyler Technologies Odyssey Portals were accessed by search, then direct case requests?
   — Alameda County, California - Court Records
  — Brazos County, Texas - Court Records (received case IDs, courtesey processed)
  — Chambers County, Texas - Court Records (received case IDs, pending)
  — DeKalb County, Georgia - Court Records
  — Fresno County, California - Court Records
  — Glenn County, California - Court Records
  — Glynn County, Georgia - Court Records
  — Gwinnett County, Georgia - Court Records
  — Harris County, Texas - Court Records
  — Houston County, Georgia - Court Records
  — Hunt County, Texas - Court Records
  — Kansas - Statewide Court Records
  — Kern County, California - Court Records
  — Napa County, California - Court Records
  — Ohio - Court Records
  — Rockwall County, Texas - Court Records
  — San Bernardino County, California - Court Records
  — Santa Barbara County, California - Court Records
  — Santa Clara County, California - Court Records
  — Wichita County, Texas - Court Records (received case IDs, courtesey processed)
  — Yolo County, California - Court Records
 Courtesey processed means that there's no basis or reason to believe that these data sources are at issue,
as far as judyrecords is concerned, but that the jurisdiction still provided the list of case IDs intended to be public or
nonpublic out of caution.
 Which Tyler Technologies Odyssey Portals were accessed by direct case requests?

 According to Tyler's 4/1 update [here](https://www.tylertech.com/dataharvest):

We continue to work on securing cooperation from judyrecords.com

 Considering I sent Tyler 16 15 data sources upfront nearly a month ago, while they've returned only 1, the above
statement is extraordinarily dishonest.
 And previous updates:

judyrecords.com’s continued cooperation is extremely important

The operator of judyrecords.com has indicated a willingness to share detailed information that will assist Tyler

 Additionally, my understanding now is that Tyler likely represented to California courts that I had provided data
for only 3 California courts, when in fact I had actually provided all 13 California direct access data sources on March 4th.
 \* 7/18 - Muscogee is a county in Georgia and was inadvertently included in the original list.
 My jurisdiction was not in the first list. Does that mean nonpublic cases weren't exposed?
 In general, no.
 However, these are low risk at least as far as judyrecords is concerned.
 If judyrecords has any issues with these data sources, then Tyler's entire product was access control defective, not just the most important part (i.e., case access).
 As mentioned in the first question, it is my current understanding/assumption that any non classic Odyssey Portal had
the issue of no authorization check for direct access.
 Depending on what the counts look like when data is provided, whether or the extent to which this is the case
will become more apparent.
 Additionally, this is not considering the "any dog with a link" update issue described in the section "It Gets Worse".
 How long has Tyler known about which jurisdictions were accessed which way by judyrecords?
 I provided Tyler this information on March 4th, before the end of the first discussion I had with them.
 How long has Tyler known about the "any dog with a link" problem?
 See the section "It Gets Worse" for details.
 I sent that message to the CA State Bar to forward to Tyler on March 2nd, who had been in communication with Tyler up to that point, whereas I had not.
 Will judyrecords be providing any more data upfront?

Tyler sent [this](/public-uploads/tyler-technologies-3-26.png) 3/26.

 No.
 Only in return at this point.
 Any other form of collaboration is unacceptable.
 Tyler's software had an [extrordinaliy](https://www.law360.com/articles/1470532/court-files-offline-in-several-states-after-security-flaw-found) [bad](https://www.law360.com/articles/1473316/odyssey-portal-security-gap-verified-as-developer-tackles-fix) defect, we've got a huge fucking mess,
and I've gone far beyond what was agreed. 3x more to be exact. See "Type 2 Collaboration And Disbelief" for details.
 Yet Tyler's position has been to continue to demand more without returning data in kind.
 At some point, you have to put on the [brakes](/public-uploads/tyler-technologies-3-26-2.png).
 Tyler:
 You fucked up not implementing basic security, and you need to own it.
 I'm not going to do anything that will hamper your incentive to collaborate back at this point,
and that means not providing data upfront, any longer. Only in return.
 Why?
 I have to do this because that's the only way I have a fighting chance of keeping you accountable and maximally ensuring I can get the data right on my side.
 Regarding #2, Odyssey Portals (non classic) that were accessed by direct case requests only would be the scope
of cases at issue as far as judyrecords is concerned.
 Also see "Tyler has said that judyrecords needs to provide full data about cases up front, and that this is necessary. Is that true?".
 Were any of the unprotected case links indexed by Google from Odyssey Portals?
 Yes.
 The number still indexed by Google as of 4/4 in fact is around a quarter million — even after Tyler changed the case URLs for all their sites.
See [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:%22CaseDetail?eid%22&filter=0).
 The number for Idaho alone is sitting around 100k right now. See [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:%22CaseDetail?eid%22%20site:https://mycourts.idaho.gov&filter=0).
 Even
[sealed](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:%22CaseDetail?eid%22%20site:https://mycourts.idaho.gov%20%22case%20sealed%22%20-%22un-sealed%22%20-%22unsealed%22&filter=0)
[cases](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:%22CaseDetail?eid%22%20site:https://mycourts.idaho.gov%20%22order%20expunging%20juvenile%22%20-%22denied%22&filter=0) — unprotected and publicly available in Google's index from Idaho's own Tyler portal.
Google suggests the phrase "[felony expungement](/public-uploads/screencapture-google-search-2022-04-04-11_45_40.png)", seemingly related to the contents of the search.
 According to [Google](/public-uploads/2022-04-04_12-23-06.png), cases from Idaho's portal have been indexed as far back as 2015. This is consistent with the Internet Archive's capture of the Odyssey Portal at that link [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20161124004111/https%3A//mycourts.idaho.gov/).
 Has Google been keeping up to date on the sealed cases of Odyssey Portal clients?
 Well, yes. From Google's cache [here](/public-uploads/2022-04-04_12-11-09.png).
Sealed cases receiving updates on Google months, even years, after the fact.
 Does that mean sealed cases have been publicly available from other jurisdictions on Google, like Idaho?
 Also yes.
 The number of these unprotected case links still lingering in Google's index as of today, even though it's still almost a quarter million,
is likely to be a small subset compared to what's been available over previous years.
 Where was the mapping of case ID to URL provided?
 The mapping was provided as part of the Odyssey search API case results object.
 An actual example:
 "CaseResults": [{
"NodeID": "222223",
"LocationName": "Civil",
"CaseId": 2900,

## Previous Updates

*April 19, 2022*

As of April 2, 2022, 99% of potentially affected client Odyssey Portals have been remediated. The remediation for each client is unique and based on individual configurations and preferences. We are optimistic that we will reach 100% remediation soon.

We continue to work cooperatively with judyrecords.com on behalf of our clients to best understand what nonpublic data, if any, may have been made available via the judyrecords.com site. Tyler has developed a process to facilitate our clients' investigations and we continue to make resources available to streamline such process for all stakeholders.

In addition, Tyler is coordinating with multiple third-party security firms, including Mandiant, on this active investigation. While a complete forensic analysis is still underway, we are pleased to have nearly all potentially affected Odyssey Portal users remediated and live.

---

*March 21, 2022*

Remediation efforts and the security of our clients’ data remain Tyler’s top priorities. Our cross-functional internal team along with our third-party security firms have been working continuously on behalf of our clients since this matter was first identified. We are committed to working in a forensically sound, responsible manner.

As of March 21, 2022, over 80% of potentially affected client Odyssey Portals have been remediated and are back online. Our support team continues to work with remaining clients on remediation based on their individual configurations and scheduling preferences.

Tyler is working with and on behalf of our clients to best understand what nonpublic data may have been made available through a judyrecords.com search, if any, and what data may have actually been viewed via the judyrecords.com site, if any. We understand from judyrecords.com that they have the ability to both identify what data was harvested and what was accessed while on their site and, thus, judyrecords.com’s continued cooperation is extremely important.

For those clients where judyrecords.com has provided the full data, Tyler has worked to help our clients fully assess the harvested information and identify what may have been viewed or accessed while on this third-party site. Tyler will continue acting as an intermediary between these clients and judyrecords.com to ensure that all nonpublic information has been removed from this third-party site. We look forward to judyrecords.com’s continued cooperation in this effort.

---

*March 8, 2022*
 On Feb. 24, 2022, Tyler Technologies was notified by the State Bar of California that nonpublic case record data was posted to judyrecords.com. Judyrecords.com is not associated with the State Bar of California or Tyler. Tyler immediately launched an extensive investigation.

Based on our research to date, it appears that judyrecords.com regularly conducts data harvesting to make public records available through an online search tool. During judyrecord.com’s harvesting activity, it appears that certain public and nonpublic case records were accessed by judyrecords.com via the State Bar of California’s Odyssey Portal and made available for search on the judyrecords.com site. Tyler confirmed this activity did not involve access to the State Bar’s Odyssey case management system and was contained to its public-facing Odyssey Portal.

On Feb. 28, 2022, Tyler learned that judyrecords.com may have performed data harvesting activity on the Odyssey Portals of other Tyler clients, and may have made certain nonpublic data of other Tyler clients available for search online as well. Tyler quickly contacted clients that have an installation of Odyssey Portal identified as potentially affected and provided recommendations for containment, including the option of taking their portal offline and similar mitigation steps.

The data harvesting activity surfaced a vulnerability in the Odyssey Portal that is being addressed through intensive efforts by the Tyler team in coordination with our clients. Clients use the Odyssey Portal to provide access to public case records, but also may authorize and grant access to approved third parties to access nonpublic case records. Tyler is working with clients to make sure that only authorized parties can access nonpublic case records.

On March 4, 2022, judyrecords.com confirmed to Tyler that they had performed data harvesting on the Odyssey Portals of other Tyler clients and had information that could assist in identifying the exposed nonpublic records. Please see the steps below for more information.

## Steps Being Taken

1. The issue is of utmost concern to Tyler. Tyler’s first priority is working with our clients to (1) ensure the security of their data, and (2) remediate the issue as soon as possible so our clients can continue to use Odyssey Portal to serve their constituents.

2. We are gathering as much information as possible to determine what type of data was accessed and whose nonpublic data may have been made available through a judyrecords.com search. We are committed to sharing our findings with our clients and taking appropriate actions to ensure security of client data.

3. Tyler and judyrecords.com are currently coordinating with each other to identify other potentially impacted Tyler clients. The operator of judyrecords.com has indicated a willingness to share detailed information that will assist Tyler in determining which client data was involved. Tyler acknowledges and appreciates that judyrecords.com has taken steps to contain further disclosure of nonpublic information. We acknowledge judyrecords.com takes the position that the accessing and disclosure of nonpublic information by judyrecords.com was inadvertent.

4. Tyler has been receiving and will continue to work to receive information from judyrecords.com and from Tyler’s clients in a forensically sound manner to assist with the investigation. Tyler has engaged our outside security team, Mandiant, to assist with this work. Tyler looks forward to continuing to work cooperatively with judyrecords.com and with our potentially impacted clients to ensure a full investigation is completed and all nonpublic information remains confidential.

## FAQs

### [Why were nonpublic records accessible in this way?](#la-296941-why-were-nonpublic-records-accessible-in-this-way)

This issue surfaced a vulnerability in some versions of Odyssey Portal that has been addressed through intensive efforts by the Tyler team in coordination with our clients.

### [How many Odyssey Portal locations were involved with data harvesting and what kind of data was harvested?](#la-2969418-how-many-odyssey-portal-locations-were-involved-with-data-harvesting-and-what-kind-of-data-was-harvested)

We are continuing to research the specifics of what clients and data may be impacted. As soon as we know more and can share those results with our clients, we will do so.

### [Was my nonpublic information made publicly available?](#la-296942-was-my-nonpublic-information-made-publicly-available)

Tyler is continuing to work with judyrecords.com to help clients determine what public and nonpublic records were obtained and what may have been publicly viewed or made available.

### [How soon can each Odyssey Portal be remediated?](#la-296943-how-soon-can-each-odyssey-portal-be-remediated)

As of April 21, 2022, 100% of potentially affected client Odyssey Portals have been remediated.

### [Judyrecords.com has asked Tyler to state its belief as to whether or not the nonpublic records were harvested intentionally. What is Tyler’s response?](#la-2969419-judyrecordscom-has-asked-tyler-to-state-its-belief-as-to-whether-or-not-the-nonpublic-records-were-harvested-intentionally-what-is-tylers-response)

Tyler has previously acknowledged that judyrecords.com’s position is that its accessing and disclosure of nonpublic information was inadvertent. In addition, Tyler has also stated that it is taking a deliberate, systematic approach to the research and forensic activities it has mobilized. While we understand that involved parties desire a quick resolution, our focus is on conducting a full and responsible forensic analysis, which takes time. Consistent with standard forensic protocols, it is not prudent to draw conclusions while this analysis is ongoing. We continue to appreciate judyrecords.com’s cooperation with Tyler and look forward to continued collaboration.

### [How many Tyler clients use Odyssey Portal?](#la-2969414-how-many-tyler-clients-use-odyssey-portal)

In 2022, there are 90 clients who had deployed a public-facing version of the Odyssey Portal solution. Odyssey Portal is not the same product as the Odyssey case management solution or the Odyssey File & Serve (e-filing) solution, each of which is deployed more broadly across the United States than Odyssey Portal.

### [What does it mean if a jurisdiction is listed on judyrecords.com?](#la-296949-what-does-it-mean-if-a-jurisdiction-is-listed-on-judyrecordscom)

Simply having a county’s name appear on a list of harvested sites made public by judyrecords.com does not mean nonpublic information was harvested. We continue to work with judyrecords.com and our clients to determine the scope and nature of any harvested data.

Search tips

* Trigger name matching
  + Strict name matching (name + 3 commas)
    - first middle last,,,
    - first m last,,,
    - first last,,,
  + Lenient name matching (name + 2 commas)
    - first middle last,,
    - first m last,,
    - first last,,
  + Trying strict then lenient matching each using a full middle name often produces the most useful results.
    - 1st - donald john trump,,,
    - 2nd - donald john trump,,
  + If extra filtering is needed, additional qualifiers may be specified after the name part.
    - donald j trump,, texas
    - barack obama,, ("affordable care act" OR "aca")
  + Sometimes both modes will produce the same results.
* Exact phrase
  + "economic loss rule"
  + "46.2-806"
  + "donald j trump"
* Exact phrase proximity
  + "donald j trump"~4 - allow those terms to be up to 4 words out of order.
    - Matches "donald j trump" but also "trump donald j".
  + "trump casino"~5
    - Search for trump close to the word casino.
* Exclude
  + "donald trump" -florida
  + cnn.com -patent (exclude patents)
* AND/OR/NOT/()
  + "summary judgment" AND "employment discrimination"
  + ("donald j trump"~4) OR ("donald john trump"~4) OR ("donald trump"~3)
  + AND/OR/NOT must be uppercase.
  + AND/OR/NOT should generally be used with parentheses to ensure you get the expected results.
    - For example, (donald trump) OR (paul manafort) will produce the expected results. donald trump OR paul manafort will not, and will be logically interpreted as donald AND (trump OR paul) AND manafort, rather than the expected (donald AND trump) OR (paul AND manafort).
    - Combine with exact phrase proximity for better results: ("donald trump"~3) OR ("paul manafort"~3)
  + AND is the default operator implicitly used between terms.
    - For example, ("donald trump"~3) AND ("paul manafort"~3) is the same thing as "donald trump"~3 "paul manafort"~3.

Immediately. edit: In fact a HN User said this with NO REPLY from the author of that Show HN: I have some records that are sealed, but show up in this database.

High profile cases aren’t like that but most things are not high profile. Just because you can’t make something 100% perfect doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. Locks aren’t unbreakable. Seatbelts won’t always save you. Your cloud service won’t always stay up. Yet we use and build all these things and no one has an issue with it. And for all intents and purposes, if court records are meant to be hidden to protect someone’s future chance of success, by all means we should do what we can. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [giantg2](user?id=giantg2) [on March 1, 2022](item?id=30507092)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30502799) | [prev](#30502865) | [next](#30503048) [–]  I don't think the discussion is about sealed records. I think the main point here is that the state needs to adequately seal the record. As a side note, I don't think Bar complaints should be private. People running the system should be transparent. The *only* reason transparency should be limited is with the name of the witness. Otherwise, how can we be sure the system is functioning correctly? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TedDoesntTalk](user?id=TedDoesntTalk) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30503048)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30502692) | [prev](#30502799) | [next](#30502425) [–]  > once something is public, and in control of others, it is impossible to make them 'un-public' without violating the 1st amendment.

How do you propose someone could stop someone from releasing a record they acquired publicly, exactly? Seize it? Prohibit someone from saying something they found out via a public route on penalty of fine or prison? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [verve\_rat](user?id=verve_rat) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30504733)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30503263) | [next](#30502425) [–]  Um, yes? Courts can issue injunctions to stop people from publishing material they have. If they breach the injunction they can go to jail, or have some other penalties imposed. Even in the US there are limits on free speech. A judge would weigh 1st amendment rights vs other considerations, but there are limits. Yelling fire in a theatre and all that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lazide](user?id=lazide) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30505016)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30504733) | [next](#30502425) [–]  Which works if it is 1 document, or one publisher, so someone can do the paperwork and a judge can handle it. And does infringe their 1st amendment rights, by the way. And if it’s a million documents and the publisher is everyone who got a torrent done in the months before the injunction? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TedDoesntTalk](user?id=TedDoesntTalk) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30505335)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30505016) | [next](#30502425) [–]  No one is talking about the reality of removing a million sources from the internet. We’re talking about the legal consequences and 1st amendment rights of individuals. You do not have a 1st amendment right to post, for example, classified documents or protected intellectual property. If you post those things, even if 2,000 people posted them before you, the law can still come down on you. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [salawat](user?id=salawat) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30506349)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30505335) | [next](#30506584) [–]  You sbsolutely do have a right topost blassified documents if you come across them, but have not attained a security clearance. There's definitely a massive "should" aspect there, however, the courts will protect you in that case. The one who got them for you, or if you committed a crime in acquiring them however... That is a different story. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [alasdair\_](user?id=alasdair_) [on March 1, 2022](item?id=30510323)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30506349) | [next](#30506584) [–]  Oddly, classified documents that could theoretically harm real people are legal to share with others but don’t you dare try to share the latest Beyonce track or there will be hell to pay.

Yes. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_York\_Times\_Co.\_v.\_United\_S...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States) And the ruling was printing classified documents was protected, though the government is trying to reverse this ruling with the Assange case. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vageli](user?id=vageli) [on March 1, 2022](item?id=30515892)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30508596) | [next](#30506512) [–]  As I understand it, the government is not trying to reverse this ruling with the Assange case. The government posits that Assange helped in the acquisition of the documents, which is separate from their dissemination, IIRC. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [boomboomsubban](user?id=boomboomsubban) [on March 1, 2022](item?id=30516115)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30515892) | [next](#30506512) [–]  Assange faces 18 charges, one of them has anything to do with his allegedly helping acquire documents. The others are violations of the Espionage Act for receiving and publishing documents. So until they drop all other charges, any "acquisition" he may have done is secondary to their attempt to outlaw publishing. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fire](user?id=fire) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30506512)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30505335) | [prev](#30506584) | [next](#30505900) [–]  oooh, while reading this thread, it crossed my mind that, well, if this website knows where it got the data from, then it could provide that info to the end-user, so they could actually have the source removed. It isn't infeasible to see a future where this website could continue to provide the public the benefit of its existence, and also help protect the people who actually do need to have their records protected; It sort of depends on how anarchistic the maintainers lean, and how much of an appetite courts actually have for fixing record leaks rather than blocking access to the tools or suing... I guess you could verify a record should be in a sealed state with the file that states the sealing happened, right? I vaguely remember document IDs from the last time I touched anything related to them. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lazide](user?id=lazide) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30505900)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30505335) | [prev](#30506512) | [next](#30502425) [–]  We aren’t talking about any of those things - we’re specifically talking about public records however. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wolverine876](user?id=wolverine876) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502425)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30502331) | [prev](#30502692) | [next](#30502433) [–]  Without transparency, including public records, how do we hold the powerful accountable? Court records are public to prevent secret government courts from abusing people (among other reasons). How do we operate a democracy, which depends on citizens controlling their country? And most importantly, who does get access to the records? That exculsive access will give them a lot of power. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SllX](user?id=SllX) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502636)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30502425) | [next](#30503199) [–]  Something that stuck out to me about that website is that we really do publish a lot. If you ever had a speeding ticket, that’s a matter of public record now. If you ever had a parking violation, that’s a matter of public record. I mean to be honest, if you just have a car, I can probably find you on that website if I know your name. Also goes for divorces. By and large I agree with your take, but playing around with the search got me thinking that maybe we just make too much a matter of public record and that some things might just be too noisy, even if it isn’t the biggest privacy violation per se. Still mulling it over though, so I can’t say I’m committed to that position yet, feel free to talk me back. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wolverine876](user?id=wolverine876) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502881)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30502636) | [next](#30502817) [–]  I agree there are limits; there are no absolutes in anything. We don't have absolute free speech: you can't slander, commit fraud, conspire to commit a crime, incite a deadly stampede, etc. I think the main concern is that the more powerful the actor (e.g., government is very powerful) the more important transparancy is, and the more vulnerable the actor, the more important privacy is. For example, if an Apple (picking a random company) employee complains to authorities about dangerous working conditions, that employee may be very vulnerable - Apple could blacklist them; other businesses, if they learned of the complaint, could do the same, not wanting a 'troublemaker'. And that employee may be financially vulnerable, needing the job; their privacy should be maintained if possible. But Apple and the government are both powerful and there should be transparency about the working conditions, investigation, and outcome. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SllX](user?id=SllX) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30503026)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30502881) | [next](#30503054) [–]  So what’s the limiting principle you would use? That’s the problem. I no more care about Apple’s speeding violations than I do Joe Schmo’s, but I probably do care about whether Joe here has a criminal history if I’m interviewing him, and the nature of that history. You could go by legal entity, just make lawsuits involving corporations public, and lawsuits between individuals private: but while Apple might have global influence, your rich and litigious neighbor in a rural county is probably a more immediate concern to you. Also individuals can sue corporations and corporations can sue individuals. I’m still inclined to think court records should stay public, but I’m now more interested in seeing if there’s a kind of filter we can put on what we make public than I was two weeks ago. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wolverine876](user?id=wolverine876) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30506792)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30503026) | [next](#30503054) [–]  Two thoughts: \* There are different levels of availability: For example, some court records could be public but not available outside the courthouse. \* Court records could be public by default, but take into account certain factors: Public interest, the power of the party, the vulnerability of the party. Criminal cases should probably be public - it is not dispute resolution (as with civil cases) but the government taking someone's freedom and/or property.

In theory, anything that went to trial would have transcripts available (unless it's sealed, like for minors). Many of these complaints could still have the transcripts available for the cases associated with them. But it's hard to tell what the *alleged* problem or misconduct is. I emphasize alleged because I assume the nonpublic ones were ones in which the lawyer was not found "guilty". In my state, the Bar will only investigate prosecutors if the court has already issued a statement determining prosecutorial misconduct occurred. So prosecutors get off without scrutiny most of the time. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nisegami](user?id=nisegami) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30503186)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30502425) | [prev](#30507171) | [next](#30502433) [–]  >Court records are public to prevent secret government courts from abusing people Except of course, when "national security" is involved. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mistrial9](user?id=mistrial9) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502433)   | [root](#30502177) | [parent](#30502331) | [prev](#30502425) | [next](#30502415) [–]  please recall a basic motivation for the formation of the United States of America, versus the Kingdom of Britain under George III.

When you renew your membership, there are a variety of addon payments you can opt into by checking boxes for these items. Then, on a later page, there are various addon payments that you have to opt out of. Making things even trickier, these aren't pre-checked boxes, which might lead the user to realize he needs to uncheck them. Instead, there is a list of "adjustments" with a dropdown menu for each. The dropdown defaults to "none", which would lead users to think that they are not paying for an extra item. But when you click on the dropdown, you see the option to "deduct $x" if you don't want to pay the additional fee. I've never seen a dark pattern like this anywhere else.

I was going to joke that you're a lawyer, you should sue them, but they're not doing anything illegal, just very shady. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gnicholas](user?id=gnicholas) [on March 1, 2022](item?id=30507528)   | [root](#30502439) | [parent](#30506689) | [next](#30508994) [–]  I actually made a screen recording and thought about writing up a blog post. But it seemed like the overlap between [people who care about law/lawyers] and [people who care about dark patterns] was too small to warrant much effort.

Thanks for the pointer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rahimnathwani](user?id=rahimnathwani) [on March 1, 2022](item?id=30508994)   | [prev](#30502439) | [next](#30502207) [–]  "Under California Business and Professions Code 6086.1(b), all disciplinary investigations are confidential until the time that formal charges are filed, and all investigations are confidential until a formal proceeding is instituted." Does this part of the code apply to everyone, or only the folks in charge of the investigations, or in charge of safeguarding the information? If someone is in a bar and overhears a Bar employee talking loudly about an investigation, do they have a legal duty to keep what they heard confidential? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chrismcb](user?id=chrismcb) [on March 1, 2022](item?id=30509046)   | [parent](#30508994) | [next](#30502207) [–]  No. Once confidential information is leaked, it is no longer confidential. The person who leaked the data can be in trouble. But the person who received it isn't... Assuming they didn't break any laws receiving it. In your particular example, the Bar employee shouldn't have been talking about confidential stuff in public, where it can be overheard. There is no expectation of privacy in a bar, so the eavesdropper is most likely on the clear. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [user3939382](user?id=user3939382) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502207)   | [prev](#30508994) | [next](#30502443) [–]  This is probably a stupid question to those who work with these concepts often: can all the user data in the DB be hashed with the user’s password so that nothing is gained from a breach? Is this mostly a CPU resource problem or would would jwt architecture preclude that from working? (I haven’t built auth systems for several years) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [stingraycharles](user?id=stingraycharles) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502295)   | [parent](#30502207) | [next](#30502716) [–]  You could encrypt it with the user’s password instead (rather than hashing it). This is also the approach taken by e.g. password managers, they use your password as a seed for encrypting all your data. The problem is that this would make the database entirely inaccessible unless you have access to the password. That creates quite a lot of friction in the user experience, the user would have to provide his password on every interaction (ie not just when logging in). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Ajedi32](user?id=Ajedi32) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502667)   | [root](#30502207) | [parent](#30502295) | [next](#30502716) [–]  Users wouldn't need to provide their password on *every* interaction; just when logging in. The browser could save a derived decryption key in a cookie or local storage and use that to persist the session. We're basically just discussing end-to-end encryption. The real reason it's not done more often is that it makes things a lot of things way more complicated from a development perspective. Features like "allow users to send messages to each other" that would normally be really simple to implement suddenly require a whole public key infrastructure and logic to take into account edge cases like "What if the user got a new phone or changed their password and was offline when the message was sent?", or onerous threat models like "What if the server is controlled by an attacker when I sign-in?" | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kelseyfrog](user?id=kelseyfrog) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502738)   | [root](#30502207) | [parent](#30502667) | [next](#30502716) [–]  Not exactly following. Couldn't DMs simply not be E2E encrypted while maintaining encryption for personal info? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Ajedi32](user?id=Ajedi32) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502894)   | [root](#30502207) | [parent](#30502738) | [next](#30502716) [–]  End to end encrypted with what key? What if the user changed their password? What if they got a new phone? What if the server is only *pretending* the user got a new phone to trick you into leaking your messages? All of those problems are solvable, but "simply" is hardly the word I'd use to describe designing a secure end-to-end encrypted application. It's way, *way* more development effort than just "hash user passwords with bcrypt and don't allow access without the password", which is why it's rarely done unless E2E encryption is a major selling point of the application. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kelseyfrog](user?id=kelseyfrog) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30503003)   | [root](#30502207) | [parent](#30502894) | [next](#30502716) [–]  Sorry, still not following. I wrote not E2E encrypted. I'm struggling to understand why messages that are not E2E encrypted would require key management. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Ajedi32](user?id=Ajedi32) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30503296)   | [root](#30502207) | [parent](#30503003) | [next](#30502716) [–]  Sorry, misread. Yes, you could symmetrically encrypt the *tiny* portion of personal data that needs to be read *solely* by you without much added complexity. However, with few exceptions (password managers, backups, personal notes, etc), the whole point of uploading data to an online service is to allow it to be shared with other people or services. Once that happens, you need all those complicated key management and security systems I just talked about. It's effectively end-to-end encryption. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [johnmarcus](user?id=johnmarcus) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502716)   | [parent](#30502207) | [prev](#30502295) | [next](#30502298) [–]  The data is read by more than one person, so this likely wouldn't work. Also, I'm not sure this is an actual breach. I think they accidentally published the data themselves, that's the vibe I'm getting from reading between the lines. It's like the code maybe missed checking a flag that would exclude private records from showing. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [willcipriano](user?id=willcipriano) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502298)   | [parent](#30502207) | [prev](#30502716) | [next](#30502251) [–]  That would seem to only work if the user would only be interested in records created by themselves or that were explicitly shared with them. When sharing both users passwords would have to be stored somewhere, either that or the raw content so that it could be reencrypted. Private key cryptography would be better, maybe encrypt a private key with a password and store that along with the public? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jaywalk](user?id=jaywalk) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502251)   | [parent](#30502207) | [prev](#30502298) | [next](#30502567) [–]  The reason we can store and use password hashes is because the user provides their password every time they login. So we hash the password they provided at login and compare that to the hash that was stored. We can't determine what their password is based on the hash alone, which is why we couldn't hash all the user data in the DB with their password and store that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [d4mi3n](user?id=d4mi3n) [on Feb 28, 2022](item?id=30502567)   | [parent](#30502207) | [prev](#30502251) | [next](#30502243) [–]  There's concept similar to what you're describing called crypto-shredding[1]. Hashing isn't a good way ensure the confidentiality of data--just the authenticity--you really want to prefer a solid cryptographic algorithm if your goal is to ensure data remains confidential. The idea behind crypto shredding is that you have a cryptographic key for each entity in your system and you use that key encrypt all fields for a given record. When it comes time to delete that data, you simply discard the key used to encrypt it. Assuming you've used reasonably good cryptography, this data is now effectively gone. This is useful in cases where: \* You need to support the right to be forgotten (as defined in the CCPA[2] or GDPR[3]), since all you need to do to "delete" a user's data is to delete the key used to encrypt. \* The data you need to delete exists across multiple data stores/applications/environments and ensuring consistency for the deletion across all these places is difficult. For example: You may have DB backups, long-lived caches, or 3rd party services/vendors that may have copies of this data. \* You want to discard some, but not all, of a user's data. This is important in cases you're required by law to retain specific kinds of information even after a person has required it's deletion. For example, banking and finance companies are required to keep specific records about who they sent money to or performed services for. 1. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-shredding> 2. <https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa> 3.

This webpage provides updates and answers questions about a breach of confidential case profile data recently discovered by the State Bar.

**August 25, 2022**

All parts of the notification process described  in the May 6 update below were completed as of July 11, 2022.

**June 3, 2022**

As an update to the State Bar’s notification plan outlined below, notifications have been sent to Group 1 listed below: the 1,300 complainants, witnesses, or respondents whose names appeared in the 1,034 confidential records that showed evidence of a page view. Notifications to Groups 2, 3, and 4 listed below are in progress, with an expected completion date of June 17.

**May 6, 2022**

The State Bar is implementing a notification plan for complainants, witnesses, and respondents whose names appeared in the approximately 322,525 confidential[[1]](#footnote-1) records that were available on judyrecords from approximately October 15, 2021, to February 26, 2022.

Here are highlights of the State Bar’s current notification plan:

* **Group 1: Confidential records with page views**
  + The State Bar will notify approximately 1,300 complainants, witnesses, or respondents whose names appeared in the 1,034 confidential records that showed evidence of a page view. [Sample witness notice](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/DataBreach/Sample-Notice-Witness-Viewed-Records-No-Personal-Information.pdf) | [Sample respondent notice](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/DataBreach/Sample-Notice-Viewed-Records-No-Personal-Information.pdf)
  + Of these records, 6 contained the case type “Inactive 6007(b)(3) Mental Illness or Substance Abuse.” [Sample notice](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/DataBreach/Sample-Notice-Respondent-Viewed-Records.pdf)
  + Notices to Group 1 will be sent by email, or by postal mail if we do not have email addresses on file.
* **Group 2: Confidential records with no page views, respondents**
  + For respondents whose names appeared in confidential records for which there is no evidence of a page view, notices will be sent by email, or by postal mail if we do not have email addresses on file. [Sample notice](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/DataBreach/Sample-Notice-Unviewed-Records.pdf)
* **Group 3: Confidential records with no page views, complainants and witnesses with email addresses**
  + For complainants and witnesses whose names appeared in confidential records for which there is no evidence of a page view, notices will be sent by email if we have email addresses on file.
  + The State Bar has email addresses for approximately 100,000 complainants and witnesses, about 37 percent of those named in unviewed records.
* **Group 4: Confidential records with no page views, complainants and witnesses with only postal addresses**
  + As a last stage of the notification process, complainants and witnesses named in unviewed records for whom we have only a postal address will be sent notices by postal mail.
* The State Bar has contracted with a third-party administrator to send the notices and respond to inquiries.
* Notifications are expected to begin this week, with email distribution expected to take five to seven business days. Postal mail distribution, especially for Group 4, is expected to take two to four weeks.

Although the State Bar is not legally required to do so, it has committed to notifying those whose names or other information appeared in confidential records indexed on judyrecords. “We are taking these steps because we believe it’s the right thing to do,” said Leah Wilson, Executive Director. “The State Bar is committed to transparency, and maintaining the public’s trust in our agency is paramount. That said, we had to balance our commitment to be transparent with considerations of costs, logistics, and fiscal prudence. We believe we have struck the right balance.”

**Other updates:** Judyrecords has posted updates [here](https://www.judyrecords.com/what-happened-with-tyler-technologies). Tyler Technologies has posted updates [here](https://www.tylertech.com/dataharvest).

**March 15, 2022**

Public access to the [State Bar Court public records portal](https://apps.statebarcourt.ca.gov/dockets.aspx) has been restored. The portal vulnerability previously identified was remediated by Tyler Technologies, and the results were confirmed both internally and by our third-party IT security team.

**March 14, 2022**

The ongoing investigation by the State Bar’s IT incident response team, with assistance from an expert third-party forensic firm, has yielded updated counts of public and confidential[[1]](#footnote-1) State Bar records that were available on the judyrecords website—and which of those records were viewed on that site—during the period between mid-October and late February that the site made those records available. Our initial estimates were based on manual searches performed on the judyrecords site before the State Bar of California data was taken offline. Judyrecords subsequently provided us with a complete copy of the State Bar’s data from its site, which enabled us to more accurately inventory both the public and confidential records available and viewed. While our investigation is ongoing, we are providing this update for purposes of transparency.

**Available records (Counts at this time)**

* Public records available: 47,964
* Confidential records available: 322,525
* Of confidential records that were available, 188 included personal information.[[2]](#footnote-2) For example, 159 records pertained to inactive enrollment due to mental illness or substance abuse. One record included a Social Security number.

**Viewed records (Counts at this time)**

* Public records that were viewed: 60
* Confidential records that were viewed: 1,034
* Of confidential records that were viewed, 6 records contained personal information.

The State Bar plans to notify complainants, witnesses, and respondents whose names appeared in the approximately 322,525 confidential records that were available on judyrecords during the period in question, though the current evidence suggests that only 1,034 of those were actually viewed. We continue to investigate this incident and will provide additional details about the notification plan and timeline as soon as possible.

The State Bar takes the data breach seriously and is devoting significant resources to assess the impact and pursue all available remedies. After interviewing several law firms with well-respected privacy and data security practices, the State Bar has retained [Cooley LLP](https://www.cooley.com/) to advise on matters related to the data breach. Cooley partners [Tiana Demas](https://www.cooley.com/people/tiana-demas), [Travis LeBlanc](https://www.cooley.com/people/travis-leblanc), and [Michael Rhodes](https://www.cooley.com/people/michael-rhodes) have national reputations in cyber/data/privacy, with California and other government experience that makes them uniquely qualified to represent the State Bar. Reflecting its commitment to public service, Cooley is providing its impressive resources and experience to serve the State Bar at substantially discounted rates. The majority of Cooley’s rates and costs will be covered by the State Bar’s insurance. The State Bar and its carrier intend to pursue reimbursement from Tyler Technologies.

The State Bar Court public records portal remains unavailable. We are continuing to work with Tyler Technologies to remediate the portal and will provide further updates on the schedule for resuming online operations as they are available. [3/15 update: The portal is back online.]

For more information, Tyler Technologies, the provider of the impacted Odyssey Portal, has published [a webpage on the Odyssey Portal data harvesting and its implications for customers](https://www.tylertech.com/dataharvest).

[1] [1] “Confidential” records are those defined as nonpublic under the Business and Professions Code applicable to State Bar records, including information concerning closed discipline complaints that did not result in charges, and reference to mental health/substance abuse.

[2] [2] Although the State Bar is not bound by California consumer privacy law, for purposes of its review and notice protocol, the State Bar has utilized the definition of personal information contained in that law (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.29 and 1798.82).

**March 10, 2022**

In its initial[February 26 news release](/About-Us/News/News-Releases/state-bar-of-california-addresses-breach-of-confidential-data), the State Bar expressed concerns that its confidential records may have been accessed unlawfully. In that statement, the State Bar did not distinguish between unlawful access and unlawful publication of the records. This was in error. The State Bar does not contend that publication of records acquired lawfully would be unlawful. We thank the First Amendment Coalition for raising these important distinctions with us.

**March 2, 2022**

Correction to our 2/26 news release: The State Bar did not ultimately alert law enforcement, as originally stated. Based on limited information available at the time, which suggested that an unlawful access of the State Bar system may have occurred, we had intended to prepare a law enforcement referral as part of our effort to respond quickly and responsibly and fulfill any obligations to protect confidential records and those impacted. When it then appeared that the site owner’s access of confidential records was inadvertent, we held off on making the law enforcement report. When the site owner was informed that the records are confidential pursuant to statute and of the public policy supporting confidentiality of those records, they voluntarily assisted the State Bar and removed access to the records from the site.

At this time, the State Bar is preparing to report the vulnerability to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program ([CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/)), an international, community-driven effort to identify, define, and publicly catalog cybersecurity vulnerabilities. [Update: this report was submitted the week of March 7.]

As of March 1, the site owner of judyrecords has voluntarily disabled all searches of its database, “out of an abundance of caution.”

The State Bar Court portal remains unavailable until further notice. We are working with Tyler Technologies to restore public access as soon as possible. [3/15 update: the portal is back online.]

Tyler Technologies has posted an FAQ in its online customer community regarding the underlying technical issues that resulted in the breach of confidential information.

We are continuing to work with the site owner of judyrecords to get specific information about the confidential State Bar records viewed before the site was disabled.

**February 28, 2022**

The State Bar has continued its investigation with the help of an IT security firm, and has also been in contact with the owner of the judyrecords site, who has been very responsive and collaborative. It is now the State Bar’s belief that there was no malicious “hack” of its system. Instead, it appears that a previously unknown security vulnerability in the Tyler Technologies Odyssey case management portal allowed the nonpublic records to be unintentionally swept up by judyrecords when they attempted to access the public records, using a unique access method. The State Bar is working with Tyler Technologies, the maker of the Odyssey system, to remediate the security vulnerability, which we believe may not be unique to the State Bar’s implementation and could impact other users of Odyssey systems.

The State Bar and the owner of the judyrecords site are working together to ensure that nonpublic State Bar records are permanently purged from the site and that State Bar public records can be made available on the site.

“Our obligation and responsibility are to the respondents and witnesses whose nonpublic information may have been shared, and again I apologize to them for this breach,” said Leah Wilson, State Bar Executive Director. “We have confirmed that this was not a hack, but rather an access vulnerability problem with our Odyssey system. We thank judyrecords for quickly removing the files and look forward to similarly working expeditiously with Tyler Technologies to take the necessary steps to address this issue.”

**February 27, 2022**

As of late Saturday night, it appears that all State Bar records, confidential and public, have been removed from the site, with a note confirming this on the site. We are continuing to investigate.

**Background**

On February 24, 2022, the State Bar learned that a public website that aggregates nationwide court case records was displaying limited case profile data on about 260,000 nonpublic State Bar attorney discipline case records, along with about 60,000 public State Bar Court case records. [These figures have since been updated on further investigation; please see March 14 update above.] The site also appears to display confidential court records from other jurisdictions. The nonpublic case profile data from the State Bar displayed on this public website included case number, file date, case type, case status, and respondent and complaining witness names. It did not include full case records.

Updates will be added to this webpage as they become available.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**When did the State Bar first learn about the breach of nonpublic information?**

On February 24, 2022, the State Bar learned that an external public website that aggregates nationwide court case records was able to access and display limited profile data on about 260,000 nonpublic State Bar attorney discipline case records. The nonpublic records available on the site do not include detailed State Bar case records, but they do display case numbers, file dates, case types, case status, and respondents and complainant names.

The State Bar deeply apologizes to anyone impacted by this breach, and we are doing everything in our power to get to the bottom of it and prevent any future harms.

**Who first notified the State Bar about the website?**

A complaining witness brought the website to the attention of an investigator from the Office of Chief Trial Counsel, who in turn alerted their supervisor.

**Was this a hack? And how did this happen?**

As of Monday, February 28, it is the State Bar’s belief that there was no malicious “hack” of its system. Instead, it appears that a previously unknown security vulnerability in the Tyler Technologies Odyssey case management portal allowed the nonpublic records to be unintentionally swept up by judyrecords when they attempted to access public records.

**The site owner claims that the State Bar’s confidential and public case records were all previously available at a public URL. Is this true?**

The State Bar Court website allows the public to search for publicly available case information. The URL mentioned by the site owner was never used by the public and never intended for public access searches.

The State Bar has continued its investigation with the help of an IT security firm and has also been in contact with the owner of the site. As noted above, it appears that a previously unknown security vulnerability in the Tyler Technologies Odyssey case management portal allowed the nonpublic records to be unintentionally swept up by judyrecords when they attempted to access public records

**How long were the records available?**

Statistics provided by the site owner indicate that State Bar records and information were available on the judyrecords site from October 15, 2021, to February 26, 2022.

**The judyrecords site mentions that the number of affected cases is less than 1,000. What does that mean?**

The comment refers to the site owner’s estimate of pageviews of all State Bar case records, public and nonpublic, during entire initial period they were posted. The State Bar is working to confirm this information. [The State Bar has investigated and updated this figure, please see March 14 update, above.]

**What is the State Bar doing about this?**

The State Bar is taking all necessary steps to address and correct this matter. So far, we have:

* Retained a team of IT forensics experts to assist in our investigation.
* Tasked our case management system software vendor, Tyler Technologies, to investigate and remediate any issues in their Odyssey case management software or this specific implementation of it.
* Contacted the website’s hosting provider, OVH Hosting, Inc in Montreal, Canada, and domain name registrar godaddy.com requesting that the confidential data be immediately taken down.
* We have been in contact with the site owner and are working with them to permanently purge the nonpublic records so that State Bar public records can again appear on the site.
* We submitted a report on the vulnerability to [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/), an international, community-driven effort to identify, define, and catalog cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
* We engaged cyberlaw experts Cooley LLP to advise the State Bar on strategic follow-up actions.
* We are in the process of notifying those whose names or other information appeared in the confidential records.

**What should anyone concerned that their name appears on this website do?**

As of late Saturday, February 26, all State Bar records appear to have been removed from the site. As of March 1, the site owner disabled all search capabilities on the site, for all records it contains nationwide, “out of an abundance of caution."

**Is the State Bar the only public agency impacted by this?**

We believe the issue is broader than the State Bar, because it appears that confidential records from other jurisdictions are appearing on the site as well. The judyrecords site owner lists what they believe are the affected jurisdictions [here](https://www.judyrecords.com/what-happened-with-tyler-technologies). According to [this webpage from Tyler Technologies](https://www.tylertech.com/dataharvest), all potentially affected client Odyssey Portals were repaired as of April 21, 2022.
