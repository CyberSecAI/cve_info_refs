- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application does not properly sanitize parameters sent via GET methods, which are then included in the server response without proper encoding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious user can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into another userâ€™s browser, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs with embedded scripts, an attacker can inject scripts into the response of the affected endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative/root role access to the web application.
