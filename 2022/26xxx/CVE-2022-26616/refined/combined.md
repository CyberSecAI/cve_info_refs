## Description

![@asmecher](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200411?v=4&size=48)[asmecher](https://github.com/asmecher)opened [on Jan 25, 2022](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7649#issue-1114381851)

**Description of problem**

OJS/OMP/OPS currently uses the `HTTP_HOST`, `SERVER_NAME`, and `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST` headers to detect the current hostname for formulating absolute URLs.

Per <https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header>, these headers may be user-controlled and thus not trustworthy. This could be used to e.g. send password reset emails with poisoned links that direct the user to a 3rd-party site, where the reset hash can be captured. (We are not currently aware of another possible abuse via this mechanism.)

Thanks to Hemant Kashyap for reporting the issue.

**Solution**

The changes described here add support for a list of allowed host names to be provided in the config.inc.php configuration file. User-supplied values are checked against this list and only one of the listed values will be allowed.

**Affected versions**

This issue affects *all releases* of OJS, OMP, and OPS versions 3.3.0-8 and older.

**How to resolve the issue**

1. Update the code to support the new `allowed_hosts` setting. This can be done by any of the following...
   1. Upgrade OJS, OMP, or OPS to version 3.3.0-9 or newer, *or*
   2. If using git, update to the latest `stable-3_3_0` or `stable-3_2_1` branches, *or*
   3. Apply the appropriate patch for your installation:
   * 3.3.0-9 and newer: Not affected.
   * 3.3.0-1 through 3.3.0-8: [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/files/8157778/ojs-3.3.0-8.diff.txt) [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/files/8157780/omp-3.3.0-8.diff.txt) [OPS](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/files/8157781/ops-3.3.0-8.diff.txt)
   * 3.2.0 or 3.2.1: [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/files/8157784/ojs-3.2.1-4.diff.txt) [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/files/8157785/omp-3.2.1-4.diff.txt) [OPS](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/files/8157786/ops-3.2.1-4.diff.txt)
   * 3.0 to 3.1.x: Upgrading is recommended, but you may apply [this untested patch (for OJS and OMP)](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/files/8162808/older.diff.txt).
   * 2.x: No patch available; upgrading is recommended.
2. Add an `allowed_hosts` setting to the `general` section of your `config.inc.php` configuration file. Here is the description/example from `config.TEMPLATE.inc.php`:

```
; Restrict the list of allowed hosts to prevent HOST header injection.
; See docs/README.md for more details. The list should be JSON-formatted.
; An empty string indicates that all hosts should be trusted (not recommended!)
; Example:
; allowed_hosts = '["myjournal.tld", "anotherjournal.tld", "mylibrary.tld"]'
allowed_hosts = ''

```

3. You can test whether or not the configuration is working by intentionally misconfiguring `allowed_hosts`. Attempting to load a page from the software should result in a `400 Bad Request` error page.
