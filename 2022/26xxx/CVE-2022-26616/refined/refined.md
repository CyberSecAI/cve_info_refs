Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The software (OJS/OMP/OPS) uses the `HTTP_HOST`, `SERVER_NAME`, and `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST` headers to determine the current hostname for generating absolute URLs. These headers are user-controlled and can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Host Header Injection:** The software trusts the provided host headers, which can be forged. This makes the software vulnerable to host header injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can manipulate these headers to redirect users to a malicious site, potentially to capture password reset hashes or other sensitive information. The specific example given is poisoning password reset email links, leading the user to a fake site controlled by the attacker that could capture the reset hash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is the manipulation of HTTP headers, specifically `HTTP_HOST`, `SERVER_NAME`, and `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST` headers.
- The attacker would need to send a crafted HTTP request with the forged host header to the vulnerable application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker can be external, requiring no prior access to the application itself. They would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding an `allowed_hosts` setting to the `config.inc.php` file, and the application is checking the supplied host headers against the `allowed_hosts` list.

This issue affects all releases of OJS, OMP, and OPS versions 3.3.0-8 and older. The fix is available in version 3.3.0-9 and newer.
