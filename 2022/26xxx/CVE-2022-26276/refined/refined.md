Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26276:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a file inclusion issue in `index.php` of OneNav version 0.9.14.
- The `index.php` script uses a controllable parameter that is spliced without proper filtering, leading to path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers can manipulate the file path to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Unfiltered Input:** The application does not sanitize or validate user-controlled input before including files.
- **File Inclusion:**  The application uses a user-controlled parameter to specify the file to be included, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files.
- **Use of php native pearcmd.php:** The attacker leverages the ability to include the native PHP file `pearcmd.php` to gain code execution

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (Getshell):**  By including `pearcmd.php`, attackers can write malicious files to the server, achieving remote code execution and gaining control of the server (Getshell).
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Low, as it primarily allows reading arbitrary files.
- **Integrity Impact:** None as per the advisory, however, writing malicious files provides integrity impact.
- **Availability Impact:** None as per the advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be launched over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior privileges on the server.
- **No user interaction required:** The attack can be carried out without any user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
