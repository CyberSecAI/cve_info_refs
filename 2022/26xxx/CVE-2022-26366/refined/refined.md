- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress AdRotate Banner Manager plugin, in versions 5.9 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher privileged user to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could enable a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to trick a higher privileged user into performing an action.
