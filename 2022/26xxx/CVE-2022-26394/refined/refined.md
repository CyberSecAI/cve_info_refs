Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-26394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Baxter Spectrum Wireless Battery Module (WBM) does not perform mutual authentication with the gateway server host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Missing authentication for a critical function (CWE-306). Specifically, the lack of mutual authentication between the WBM and the gateway server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform a machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. This could lead to:
  - Modification of parameters, causing network connection failures.
  - Spoofing the server host to send crafted data.
  - Potential compromise of data integrity (Modification of data)
  - Potential compromise of availability (Network connection failures)
  - Potential compromise of confidentiality (Access to network traffic)

**Attack Vectors:**
Adjacent network attack. An attacker would need to be on the same network segment as the Baxter device and the gateway server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable WBM and its gateway server.
  - The attacker must be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic (man-in-the-middle capabilities).
  - No specific user interaction required for exploitation

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects specific versions of the Baxter Spectrum WBM (v16, v16D38, v17, v17D19, and v20D29 to v20D32)
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, with the vector string AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L.
