     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-26363,CVE-2022-26364 / XSA-402
                               version 4

         x86 pv: Insufficient care with non-coherent mappings

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Xen maintains a type reference count for pages, in addition to a regular
reference count.  This scheme is used to maintain invariants required
for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to
pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen.

Unfortunately, Xen's safety logic doesn't account for CPU-induced cache
non-coherency; cases where the CPU can cause the content of the cache to
be different to the content in main memory.  In such cases, Xen's safety
logic can incorrectly conclude that the contents of a page is safe.

IMPACT
======

Malicious x86 PV guest administrators can escalate privilege so as to
control the whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can trigger this vulnerability.

Only x86 PV guests configured with access to devices (e.g. PCI
Passthrough) can trigger the vulnerability.

Only CPUs which can issue non-coherent memory accesses are impacted.
CPUs which enumerate the SelfSnoop feature are not impacted, except as
noted in errata.  Therefore, we believe that Xen running on Intel
IvyBridge or later CPUs is not impacted by the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not passing devices through to untrusted x86 PV guests will avoid the
vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

Furthermore, the XSA-402 patches depend logically on the XSA-401
patches, and will not function safely without XSA-401 in place first.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

But: deployment of the mitigation (i.e., switching guests from
passed-through devices to virtual devices) is *not* permitted during
the embargo, as it could be seen by an attacker and potentially give
them a hint about the nature of the vulnerability.

Futhermore, distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 402 v4 (CVE-2022-26363,CVE-2022-26364) -
 x86 pv: Insufficient care with non-coherent mappings

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-26363,CVE-2022-26364 / XSA-402
                               version 4

         x86 pv: Insufficient care with non-coherent mappings

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Xen maintains a type reference count for pages, in addition to a regular
reference count.  This scheme is used to maintain invariants required
for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to
pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen.

Unfortunately, Xen's safety logic doesn't account for CPU-induced cache
non-coherency; cases where the CPU can cause the content of the cache to
be different to the content in main memory.  In such cases, Xen's safety
logic can incorrectly conclude that the contents of a page is safe.

IMPACT
======

Malicious x86 PV guest administrators can escalate privilege so as to
control the whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can trigger this vulnerability.

Only x86 PV guests configured with access to devices (e.g. PCI
Passthrough) can trigger the vulnerability.

Only CPUs which can issue non-coherent memory accesses are impacted.
CPUs which enumerate the SelfSnoop feature are not impacted, except as
noted in errata.  Therefore, we believe that Xen running on Intel
IvyBridge or later CPUs is not impacted by the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not passing devices through to untrusted x86 PV guests will avoid the
vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

Furthermore, the XSA-402 patches depend logically on the XSA-401
patches, and will not function safely without XSA-401 in place first.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

But: deployment of the mitigation (i.e., switching guests from
passed-through devices to virtual devices) is *not* permitted during
the embargo, as it could be seen by an attacker and potentially give
them a hint about the nature of the vulnerability.

Futhermore, distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
