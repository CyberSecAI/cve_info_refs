- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Gallagher Controller 6000 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to its handling of conflicting ARP packets with a duplicate IP address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the controller's susceptibility to being disrupted by maliciously crafted ARP packets that introduce IP address conflicts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS), potentially disrupting the controller's normal operation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker injects conflicting ARP packets into the network where the controller resides.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the Gallagher Controller 6000 and have the capability to generate and send malicious ARP packets.
