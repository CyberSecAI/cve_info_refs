- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly control the locations it searches for resources, allowing an attacker to potentially influence the loading of libraries or other executables.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privilege. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated user with local access and ability to influence the search paths. User interaction is required.
