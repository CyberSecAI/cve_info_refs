Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26645:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation and sanitization of uploaded files in the "Online Banking System Protect v1.0". Specifically, the "Upload Image" function allows users to upload files without restrictions on the file type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434):** The system does not restrict the type of files that can be uploaded, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By uploading and accessing a crafted PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise. This can include data theft, modification, or complete denial of service.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** As per CVSS scores, the impact is rated as "HIGH" across Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uses the "Upload Image" functionality to upload the malicious PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack is considered to have low complexity, meaning it is relatively easy to exploit.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker does not require any interaction from other users to execute the exploit.
*   **Access to the Vulnerable Web Application:** The attacker needs access to the web interface of the "Online Banking System Protect v1.0".

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit uses a simple PHP payload `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['shell']);?>` within an uploaded file. When accessed through a web browser, this payload executes system commands specified in the `shell` parameter.
*   The attacker modifies their profile avatar by uploading a PHP file with the malicious payload.
*   The uploaded file can be found by looking at the updated profile.
*   By accessing the URL of the uploaded file with the `shell` parameter, arbitrary commands can be executed on the server, confirming Remote Code Execution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub repository contains a README with step-by-step instructions for exploiting the vulnerability and example payload.
* The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Online Banking System" software.
