**Rambus Security Vulnerability Disclosure:  SafeZone Bas****ic Crypto Module, non-FIPS certified version**

**Publish Date: March 1, 2022**

Rambus Vulnerability ID: RMBS-2021-01

[CVE ID: 2022-26320](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26320)

**Background**

The SafeZone Crypto Libraries were developed by Inside Secure and were acquired by Rambus as part of an [acquisition from Verimatrix](https://www.rambus.com/rambus-completes-acquisition-of-the-verimatrix-silicon-ip-secure-protocols-and-provisioning-business/). There were both FIPS-certified and non-FIPS-certified versions of the SafeZone crypto libraries. The standalone non-FIPS-certified offering had been discontinued for new licenses, but Rambus continues to support existing customers of this product.

A security vulnerability has been identified in the non-FIPS-certified version of the crypto library in SafeZone as described below. A patch which remediates the vulnerability is available and has been distributed to existing customers that are affected by the vulnerability.

**“SafeZone” Product Status**

| Product Name(Crypto Module) | Affected by Vulnerability | Affected Versions | Available for Licensing | Patch Available |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SafeZone Crypto Libraries (Basic Crypto Module, non-FIPS certified) | Yes | 9.3.x, 10.0.x, 10.1.x, 10.2.x, 10.3.x | No | Yes, all versions;Also as part of SafeZone 10.4.0 |
| [FIPS Security Toolkit\*(FIPS 140-2 SW Crypto Module v1.2)](https://www.rambus.com/security/software-protocols/iot-security-framework/fips-security-tk/) | No | None | Yes | N/A |
| [FIPS Security Toolkit\*(FIPS 140-3 SW Crypto Module v2.0)](https://www.rambus.com/security/software-protocols/iot-security-framework/fips-security-tk/) | No | None | Yes | N/A |

*\*SafeZone FIPS-certified versions**are**now offered as “FIPS Security Toolkit” by Rambus*

![Figure 1. Only the SafeZone Basic Crypto Module is affected by the security vulnerability](https://www.rambus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/safezone.png)

Figure 1. Only the SafeZone Basic Crypto Module is affected by the security vulnerability

**Vulnerability** **Description**
The speed-optimized, multi-threaded version of the RSA key generation function CLS\_PK\_KeyGenMT( ) used in the non-FIPS Basic Crypto Module may create weak RSA keys.

The vulnerability does not exist in the single-threaded version of the RSA key generation function CLS\_PK\_KeyGen\_RSA( ).

**Impact**The distance between the p and q values of the generated RSA key may not be sufficient which makes the key vulnerable to factorization attacks.

**Affected Versions**

SafeZone Crypto Libraries (Basic Crypto Module) versions: 9.3.x, 10.0.x, 10.1.x, 10.2.x, 10.3.x. the last update of version 10.3.x was June 2020.

**Unaffected Versions**

FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 SW Crypto Modules are unaffected.

SafeZone Crypto Libraries (Basic Crypto Module) versions: 10.4.0 is unaffected.

**Remediation**Rambus provided a patch for all affected versions that modifies the CLS\_PK\_KeyGenMT( ) implementation in a way that ensures the distance between the p and q values is sufficient.

**Action Taken**
A customer notified Rambus of this issue on November 2, 2021. Rambus developed a patch and provided it to the affected customer within two weeks.

All other Rambus customers that may use the affected crypto library were provided with a patch on or before December 15, 2021.

More recently an ‘advisory message’ was provided to SafeZone customers with access to the Crypto Libraries to confirm that they are not affected by this vulnerability.

**Acknowledgement**
The vulnerability was found in a Rambus customer product. The vulnerability was reported to the customer by independent security researcher, Hanno Böck, who was referred to the Rambus Security IP team.

**Rambus Security Vulnerability Disclosure:  SafeZone Bas****ic Crypto Module, non-FIPS certified version**

**Publish Date: March 1, 2022**

Rambus Vulnerability ID: RMBS-2021-01

[CVE ID: 2022-26320](https://web.archive.org/web/20220922042721/https%3A//cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26320)

**Background**

The SafeZone Crypto Libraries were developed by Inside Secure and were acquired by Rambus as part of an [acquisition from Verimatrix](https://web.archive.org/web/20220922042721/https%3A//www.rambus.com/rambus-completes-acquisition-of-the-verimatrix-silicon-ip-secure-protocols-and-provisioning-business/). There were both FIPS-certified and non-FIPS-certified versions of the SafeZone crypto libraries. The standalone non-FIPS-certified offering had been discontinued for new licenses, but Rambus continues to support existing customers of this product.

A security vulnerability has been identified in the non-FIPS-certified version of the crypto library in SafeZone as described below. A patch which remediates the vulnerability is available and has been distributed to existing customers that are affected by the vulnerability.

**“SafeZone” Product Status**

| Product Name(Crypto Module) | Affected by Vulnerability | Affected Versions | Available for Licensing | Patch Available |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SafeZone Crypto Libraries (Basic Crypto Module, non-FIPS certified) | Yes | 9.3.x, 10.0.x, 10.1.x, 10.2.x, 10.3.x | No | Yes, all versions;  Also as part of SafeZone 10.4.0 |
| [FIPS Security Toolkit\*(FIPS 140-2 SW Crypto Module v1.2)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220922042721/https%3A//www.rambus.com/security/software-protocols/iot-security-framework/fips-security-tk/) | No | None | Yes | N/A |
| [FIPS Security Toolkit\*(FIPS 140-3 SW Crypto Module v2.0)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220922042721/https%3A//www.rambus.com/security/software-protocols/iot-security-framework/fips-security-tk/) | No | None | Yes | N/A |

*\*SafeZone FIPS-certified versions* *are* *now offered as “FIPS Security Toolkit” by Rambus*

![Figure 1. Only the SafeZone Basic Crypto Module is affected by the security vulnerability](https://web.archive.org/web/20220922042721im_/https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.156/exa.53e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/safezone.png)

Figure 1. Only the SafeZone Basic Crypto Module is affected by the security vulnerability

**Vulnerability** **Description**
The speed-optimized, multi-threaded version of the RSA key generation function CLS\_PK\_KeyGenMT( ) used in the non-FIPS Basic Crypto Module may create weak RSA keys.

The vulnerability does not exist in the single-threaded version of the RSA key generation function CLS\_PK\_KeyGen\_RSA( ).

**Impact**The distance between the p and q values of the generated RSA key may not be sufficient which makes the key vulnerable to factorization attacks.

**Affected Versions**

SafeZone Crypto Libraries (Basic Crypto Module) versions: 9.3.x, 10.0.x, 10.1.x, 10.2.x, 10.3.x. the last update of version 10.3.x was June 2020.

**Unaffected Versions**

FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 SW Crypto Modules are unaffected.

SafeZone Crypto Libraries (Basic Crypto Module) versions: 10.4.0 is unaffected.

**Remediation**Rambus provided a patch for all affected versions that modifies the CLS\_PK\_KeyGenMT( ) implementation in a way that ensures the distance between the p and q values is sufficient.

**Action Taken**
A customer notified Rambus of this issue on November 2, 2021. Rambus developed a patch and provided it to the affected customer within two weeks.

All other Rambus customers that may use the affected crypto library were provided with a patch on or before December 15, 2021.

More recently an ‘advisory message’ was provided to SafeZone customers with access to the Crypto Libraries to confirm that they are not affected by this vulnerability.

**Acknowledgement**
The vulnerability was found in a Rambus customer product. The vulnerability was reported to the customer by independent security researcher, Hanno Böck, who was referred to the Rambus Security IP team.

## Details of vulnerability

This vulnerability was found in a cryptographic module from a 3rd party used for the multi-function printers and single-function printers, and the secret key of RSA cryptography used for SSL/TLS encrypted connection can be guessed. If the vulnerability is exploited, there is a possibility that the contents of the connection with the affected devices can be revealed or tampered.

## Workaround Measures

In order to avoid the security breach, please apply either (or both) of the measures below, until the fixed firmware is released.

1. Recreate “Self-Signed Certificates” or “Certificate Signing Request (CSR)” after either of the setting below is completed. You can recreate certificates via CentreWare Internet Service or Internet Service.
   * Enable FIPS 140-2 certification mode

     ApeosPort-VII/DocuCentre-VII series and Apeos/ApeosPro/ApeosPrint series support this feature.
   * Select “ECDSA/SHA-256”, “ECDSA/SHA-384” or “ECDSA/SHA-512” from “Type of digital signing” as a setting of elliptic curve cryptography.
2. Please use your multi-function printers or single-function printers within the network protected by firewall, etc.
3. If your multi-function printer or single-function printer connection is open to the Internet, we encourage the use of the “restricted IP addresses” function in your security firewall or use a VPN connection.

## Eliminating the Vulnerability

The latest firmware to fix the vulnerability is released.

However, before the firmware is released, please apply the Workaround Measures listed above to reduce the impact.

After the firmware has been upgraded, customers must recreate “Self-Signed Certificates” and “Certificate Signing Request (CSR)”. Steps for recreating is described in the Appendix

For customers who have accepted the automatic firmware upgrade with the EP-BB maintenance contract, the firmware upgrade will be done by the EP-BB function after the release of the fixed firmware.

For other customers, please contact FUJIFILM Business Innovation via the support website at [https://support-fb.fujifilm.com/](https://support-fb.fujifilm.com)

### Caution

It is important that customers recreate “Self-Signed Certificates” and “Certificate Signing Request (CSR)” after the firmware is upgraded to strengthen the security.

# Fermat Attack on RSA

## Paper

[Fermat Factorization in the Wild](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/026), background paper published
at the Cryptology ePrint Archive.

## Introduction

In 1643 Pierre de Fermat developed a factorization algorithm.
The algorithm allows efficiently calculating the prime factors of a
composite number that is the product of two "close" primes.

The RSA encryption and signature algorithm relies on the fact that
factorization of large numbers is a hard problem. The RSA public key
contains a composite number (usually called N) that is the product
of two primes (usually called p and q).

If RSA keys are generated with "close" primes then RSA can be
broken with Fermat's factorization algorithm. While this is widely
known, to my knowledge no such vulnerable RSA keys have been found
in the wild before - up until now.

I applied Fermat's factorization method to large datasets of
public RSA keys. I discovered a small number of vulnerable keys that
belonged to printers from Canon and Fujifilm
(originally branded as Fuji Xerox). The devices
use an underlying cryptographic module from the company Rambus.

This research was done during development of the
[badkeys](https://badkeys.info/) project. badkeys
is a web service and tool to check cryptographic keys for known
vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**What is Fermat's factorization algorithm?**

The idea of Fermat's factorization algorithm is that a product of
two large primes can always be written as N=(a-b)(a+b), with a being
the middle between the two primes and b the distance from the middle
to each of the primes.

If the primes are close then a is close to the square root of N.
This allows guessing the value a by starting with the square root of N and then
incrementing the guess by one each round.

For each guess we can calculate b^2 = a^2 - N. If the result is
a square we know we have guessed a correctly. From this
we can calculate p=a+b and q=a-b.

Fermat described this algorithm originally in a letter in 1643. The
text of the original letter can be found in
[Oeuvres de Fermat](https://archive.org/details/oeuvresdefermat02ferm/page/n7/mode/2up), page 256, available
at the Internet Archive.

**Who is affected?**

Multiple printers of the Fujifilm Apeos, DocuCentre and DocuPrint series
generate self-signed TLS certificates with vulnerable RSA keys.
[The Fuji Advisory](https://www.fujifilm.com/fbglobal/eng/company/news/notice/2022/0302_rsakey_announce.html)
contains a list of all affected printers. (The printers use the
brand name Fuji Xerox, but the company has since been renamed
to Fujifilm.)

Some Canon printers have the ability to generate a Certificate Signing
Request with a vulnerable RSA key. To my knowledge this affects printers
of the imageRUNNER and imagePROGRAF series.

Both the Fujifilm and the Canon printers use the Basic Crypto Module
of the Safezone
library by Rambus. Other products using this module to generate RSA keys
may also be affected. This vulnerability got
[CVE-2022-26320](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26320)
assigned.

(A previous version of this webpage implied that the Canon and the
Rambus issue were two separate, unrelated vulnerabilities. This was
incorrect.
I have informed Mitre that the previously
assigned separate CVE for Canon should be rejected.)

**Is this a weakness in RSA?**

No, RSA libraries with a correct key generation function are not
affected.

**How can this happen?**

An RSA library is vulnerable if the two primes p and q are close.
If the primes are generated independently and randomly then the likelyhood
of p and q being close is neglegible.

An RSA library might however implement a flawed key generation
algorithm like this:

* Generate random number X.
* Search the next prime after X and use it as p.
* Search the next prime after p and use it as q.

For common RSA key sizes this creates p and q with a difference that is
usually in the thousands or lower. This can easily be broken with Fermat's
factorization method.

**How "close" do primes need to be in order to be vulnerable?**

With common RSA key sizes (2048 bit) in our tests the Fermat
algorithm with 100 rounds reliably factors numbers where p and q
differ up to 2^517. In other words it can be said that primes
that only differ within the lower 64 bytes (or around half their size)
will be vulnerable.

Up to 2^514 it almost always finds the factorization in the first round
of the algorithm. It could be argued that the 100 rounds is therefore
excessive, however the algorithm is so fast that it practically does not
matter much.

**Can vulnerable keys be generated by accident if primes are generated
randomly and independently?**

This is almost impossible. For primes to be "close" they would have to
be identical at least on their upper 500 bits. The chance of that happening
is therefore smaller than 1:2^500.

**How did you find those keys?**

I used multiple sets of public keys that I either had access to,
that were shared with us by other researchers or that were publicly
available.

I found the vulnerable, self-signed Fujifilm keys in recent scans
of TLS certificates by Rapid7 (Rapid7 has since closed down access to its
scan data, but I performed the tests before that). I found a small number
of valid, publicly trusted web certificates in Certificate Transparency
logs. By contacting their owners I learned about the Canon printers.

It should be noted that all vulnerable certificates were
of relatively recent origin (2020 and later). I believe that
this is the reason that no such vulnerabilities were described in
previously.

**Is SSH affected?**

There are probably no vulnerable SSH implementations creating such keys,
though I obviously cannot proove that.

I checked multiple large collections
of both SSH host and user keys.
I did not find any vulnerable keys.

**Is PGP/GnuPG/OpenPGP affected?**

I applied the algorithm to a dump of the SKS PGP key servers. I
found four vulnerable keys. However all these keys had a user ID that
did imply they were created for testing.

It is plausible that these keys were not generated
by vulnerable implementations, but were manually crafted, possibly by
people aware of this attack creating test data.

**What do you recommend?**

If you are running one of the affected devices you should make sure
that you update the devices and regenerate the keys.

If you are in a position where external users will supply public RSA
keys to you then you might want to implement checks for this vulnerability.
A typical case for this are certificate authorities. I shared the
exploit code with certificate authorities and are aware that some have
implemented checks in their certificate issuance process to avoid
accepting keys vulnerable to this attack.

You can find Let's Encrypt's implementation of the check in their Boulder
software [in this pull request](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/pull/5853).
The zlint tool has
[added a check for vulnerable keys](https://github.com/zmap/zlint/pull/674)
in [version 3.4.0](https://github.com/zmap/zlint/releases/tag/v3.4.0).

The [badkeys](https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys) tool contains code to check for this vulnerability and factor
affected keys.
