Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-37139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in several PHP files of the Loan Management System. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize input before storing it in the database, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and persistently stored in the database. This code will then execute when other users view the affected data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a user views the data, the stored JavaScript code will execute in their browser.
- This can be exploited to perform malicious actions like:
  - Stealing session cookies, allowing attackers to hijack user accounts.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Potentially performing other actions depending on the application's functionality and the injected script's capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through input fields in the following PHP files:
    - `addUser.php` (specifically the `firstname` and `lastname` parameters)
    - `save_ltype.php` (specifically the `ltype_name` and `ltype_desc` parameters)
    - `save_borrower.php` (specifically the `firstname`, `middlename`, `lastname`, and `address` parameters)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access the application interface and have the ability to input data into the identified vulnerable fields.
- They would also need to know which fields are vulnerable.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges, assuming any user can modify these fields.
- A successful attack would require the malicious code to be triggered by other users visiting pages where these stored values are displayed.
