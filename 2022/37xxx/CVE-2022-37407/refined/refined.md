The provided content is related to CVE-2022-37407.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of nonce validation in the `init()` function of the Gallery PhotoBlocks WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability is present due to missing nonce validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can delete or copy photo galleries by using forged requests.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking on a crafted link. This link would contain a forged request that, without proper nonce validation, would be processed by the vulnerable plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link).
