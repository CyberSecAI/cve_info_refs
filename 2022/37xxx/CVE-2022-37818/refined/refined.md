The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AX1803 (V1.0.0.1) firmware. This vulnerability aligns with CVE-2022-37818, as it is a known vulnerability in Tenda AX1803.

- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the insecure use of `strcpy` in the `sub_8C1EC` function, which is called by the `formSetQosBand` function. The `strcpy` function copies data from the user-controlled `list` parameter to a fixed-size stack buffer without any bounds checking.

- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Stack overflow due to unbounded `strcpy`.
    - Lack of input validation.

- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DOS) due to a crash from stack corruption.
    - Ability to hijack the program counter (PC) register, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    - By crafting a specific payload, an attacker can obtain a root shell.

- **Attack Vectors:**
    - Sending a specially crafted POST request to `/goform/SetNetControlList` with a long `list` parameter, that will trigger the vulnerable `formSetQosBand` and subsequent `sub_8C1EC` function.

- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
    - The device must be accessible on the network.
