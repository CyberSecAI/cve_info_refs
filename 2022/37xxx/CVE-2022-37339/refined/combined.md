## FAQ

### How Do I Use The Plugin?

You can use it simply with this shortcode: [meet-my-team]

### What Shortcodes Are Available

We are currently working on a few, but as of now, we support the use of the options:

1. [meet-my-team cols=”NUM”] Default: 3 where NUM can be 1,2,3,4,6. => cols will list out the number of cols of team members will be displayed in each row.
2. [meet-my-team parent\_container\_id=”ID”] where ID can be the id of the overall container encapsulating the modals => This is utilized more for theme developers who want to target the specific classes
3. [meet-my-team show\_groups=”GROUPS”] where GROUPS can be the different categories set forthe post
4. [meet-my-team enable\_modal=”BOOLEAN”] where BOOLEAN is true or false. This can be used to enable or disable the modal
5. [meet-my-team align=”ALIGN”] where ALIGN is left or center. This will allow the columns to be centered or left align.
6. [meet-my-team display\_picture=”BOOLEAN”] where BOOLEAN is true or false. This will display the picture on the page (outside of the modal)
7. [meet-my-team disable\_modal\_centering=”BOOLEAN”] where BOOLEAN is true or false. This will disable the modal centering javascript

### What responsive grid are you using

We are actually using a modified version of bootstrap. It was designed to shrink to a single column from 768px and below. More options in the future.

### [Used to work well, now gives Countable error on PHP 7.2 & 7.3](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/used-to-work-well-now-gives-countable-error-on-php-7-2-7-3/)

[kidznc](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wsp-kk/ "Posts by kidznc")

This plugin used to work fairly well, but it has not been maintained for compatibility with the 7.2+ versions of PHP due to the implementation of Countable. After upgrading one site, I’ve received the following error in the admin console:
Warning: count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable in /home/directory/public\_html/mysitedirectory/wp-content/plugins/meet-my-team/admin/includes/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields/init.php on line 755
Warning: Cannot modify header information – headers already sent by (output started at /home/directory/public\_html/mysitedirectory/wp-content/plugins/meet-my-team/admin/includes/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields/init.php:755) in /home/directory/public\_html/mysitedirectory/wp-admin/includes/misc.php on line 1196
Support has been non-existent for a year (and it hasn’t been updated in three), so I would no longer recommend this plugin.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
