The provided content includes information related to CVE-2022-37257.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue located in the `convertLater` function within the `npm-convert.js` file of the `stealjs/steal` project.
- The `convertLater` function uses the `requestedVersion` variable to create or access nested objects, which can be manipulated to inject properties into the prototype of the `Object` class.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution vulnerability in `npm-convert.js`.
- The `convertLater` function is vulnerable to prototype pollution through the `requestedVersion` variable, allowing an attacker to control the property names and values being added to the prototype.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By injecting properties into the prototype of the `Object` class, an attacker can potentially alter the behavior of the JavaScript application.
- This can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted `requestedVersion` is processed by the `convertLater` function.
- This could potentially occur through the manipulation of dependency declarations or by providing malicious package information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have some control or influence over the package information being processed by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker would need to manipulate the `requestedVersion` value in order to inject malicious properties onto the prototype chain.
