The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in H3C H200[H200-EI] (H200V100R004) devices.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Asp_SetTimingtimeWifiAndLed` function uses `sscanf` with a greedy matching format specifier `%[^;];` which doesn't check the size of the input `param`. If the input data is larger than the buffer `V12`, it leads to a stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to insecure input handling in the `Asp_SetTimingtimeWifiAndLed` function using `sscanf`. Specifically, the lack of bounds checking when using `%[^;];` to parse user input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DOS) attack. Additionally, by crafting specific payloads and calculating offsets, the attacker can achieve a stable root shell.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with a crafted payload in the `param` parameter of the `Asp_SetTimingtimeWifiAndLed` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. The specific requirement for network access is not described in the document, but given the `Host` header in the provided PoC, the device likely has an IP accessible by the attacker.
