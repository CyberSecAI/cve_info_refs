Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-37421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of a malicious content author to inject arbitrary JavaScript code through custom meta tags within the Silverstripe CMS. The CMS does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when creating custom meta tags, which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. The malicious JavaScript payload is stored within the CMS database as part of the custom meta tag. When a page containing this malicious meta tag is loaded, the JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user's browser.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The CMS fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input when creating custom meta tags, thus allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user, provided they have CMS access
- **User Keyboard Shortcut required**: An extra step required in the attack flow. The javascript payload would require a legitimate user to access a page and enter a custom keyboard shortcut.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **CMS Interface:** The attacker injects the malicious payload by creating a custom meta tag through the CMS interface.
- **User Browsers:** When a victim user visits a page that contains the custom meta tag with the malicious JavaScript payload, the code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **CMS Access:** The attacker must have an account with content authoring privileges within the Silverstripe CMS to create custom meta tags.
- **User Interaction:** Successful exploitation requires the victim user to view a page containing the malicious meta tag and entering a custom keyboard shortcut.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The issue affects Silverstripe CMS versions 4.x.x and 3.x.x.
- The fix has been released in version 4.11.3 of the CMS, which implements better validation of meta tag content to prevent JavaScript injection.
- The content explicitly mentions that the use-case for this type of injection is not legitimate.
