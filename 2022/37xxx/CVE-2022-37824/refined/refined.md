The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AX1803 (V1.0.0.1) firmware.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `fromSetWifiGusetBasic` function uses `strcpy` to copy the user-supplied `shareSpeed` parameter into a fixed-size buffer (`v39`) without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow vulnerability due to the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) - demonstrated by the provided POC.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution by hijacking the PC register and obtaining a root shell.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/WifiGuestSet` with an oversized `shareSpeed` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This would typically require network access to the router's web interface (LAN or potentially WAN if exposed).
    - No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required to trigger the vulnerability in the described proof-of-concept. However, it is noted that the cookie `ecos_pw=eee:language=cn` is being sent as part of the request, implying that there may be an authentication component or session involved.
