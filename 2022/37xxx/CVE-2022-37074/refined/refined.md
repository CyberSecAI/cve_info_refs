Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-37074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `switch_debug_info_set` function of the H3C GR-1200W router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to insecure use of `sscanf` with greedy matching (`%s`). The function reads user-controlled input using a format string that doesn't limit the size of the string being read, allowing an attacker to write past the end of the allocated buffer on the stack.
- The `param` parameter is not checked for size and can be larger than the buffer `V9`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by overflowing the stack.
- An attacker can obtain a stable root shell by crafting a special payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/goform/aspForm` with a `CMD` parameter set to `switch_debug_info_set` and a malicious `param` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable parameter and the format it expects to exploit the stack overflow.
- No authentication appears to be required based on the provided information, but a cookie is sent, which may indicate a previous step is required, not described here.
