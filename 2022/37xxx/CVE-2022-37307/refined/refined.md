{
  "CVE-2022-37307": {
    "root_cause": "The 'snippets' mechanism used to store content like email signatures has a weakness that allows injection of seemingly benign HTML content, like XHTML CDATA constructs. This content is then sanitized into malicious code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious script code can be executed within the victim's context, leading to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface, such as redirection to a third-party site.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker with access to the same OX App Suite instance or temporary access to the user's account can inject malicious code through email signatures or similar mechanisms."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs either access to the same OX App Suite instance or temporary access to a user's account to inject the malicious code into a 'snippet'.  The victim then needs to view the content to trigger the XSS."
  }
