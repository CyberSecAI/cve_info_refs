## Retbleed

**Bulletin ID:** AMP-SB-0004

**Potential Impact:** An attacker can control the predictions for return addresses and can potentially hijack code flow to execute arbitrary code.

**Severity:** CVSS score: 6.5 (Medium)

### Summary

### Who is Impacted

All users of Ampere® Altra® and Ampere® Altra® Max.

### Potential Impact

An attacker can control the predictions for return addresses and can potentially hijack code flow to execute arbitrary code.

### Severity

Medium
CVSS score: 6.5
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### Problem Statement and Impact

Retbleed is an attack that exploits the unprotected prediction of return instructions. The issue is similar to Spectre variant 2 but exploits some easily triggerable cases (for example, fallback on empty return stack) where predictions for return addresses can still be controlled by an attacker.
The Ampere® Altra® family and AmpereOne™ (formerly known as “Siryn”) are impacted by the Retbleed attack. Existing hardware mitigations (FEAT\_CSV2), recommended for Spectre v2 and Spectre-BHB, provide mitigations for attacks based on Retbleed.

### Fixed in

Ampere® Altra® 1.08g
Ampere® Altra® Max 2.05a

### Affected Products

The Ampere® Altra® family and AmpereOne™ (formerly known as “Siryn”) are impacted by the Retbleed attack.

### Recommendations

It is highly recommended to upgrade firmware to Ampere® Altra® SRP 1.08g/Ampere® Altra® Max SRP 2.05a or greater. Hardware mitigations (FEAT\_CSV2), recommended for Spectre v2 and Spectre-BHB, provide mitigations for attacks based on Retbleed.
