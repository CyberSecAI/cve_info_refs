The content is related to CVE-2022-37071.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `UpdateOne2One` function of H3C GR-1200W routers (<=MiniGRW1A0V100R006). The vulnerability stems from the use of `sscanf` with a `%s` format specifier, which is a greedy matching mechanism. The function reads user-controlled input into a fixed size buffer without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking when reading data into the `V6` buffer using `sscanf` with the `%s` format specifier. This can cause the buffer to overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite the stack, leading to a denial-of-service condition and possibly arbitrary code execution. The provided information mentions the possibility of obtaining a stable root shell.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/goform/aspForm` with the `CMD=UpdateOne2One` and an oversized `param` value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface, which is typically on the local network.
