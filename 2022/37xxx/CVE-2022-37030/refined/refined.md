Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-37030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the Gromox PAM module loads plugins. The configuration file (`/etc/gromox/pam.cfg`) for the PAM module, along with the plugin files themselves, were located in `/etc/gromox`, a directory writable by the `gromox` group. This allowed an unprivileged user to control which shared objects (.so files) are loaded and executed by the PAM module when it's invoked by the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `/etc/gromox` directory was configured with mode 775 and ownership `root:gromox`, making it writable by the unprivileged `gromox` group.
- **Unrestricted Plugin Loading:** The PAM module allowed loading of plugins based on the configuration file located within the writable directory. This enabled the `gromox` group to specify arbitrary shared object files to be executed by the PAM module.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There was no validation or restriction on the paths or file names used by the PAM module to load plugins, allowing for execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** By controlling the loaded plugins, an unprivileged user belonging to the `gromox` group could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PAM stack (typically root).
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This essentially allowed any member of the gromox group to gain root access by crafting a malicious shared object and configuring the PAM module to load it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system and membership in the `gromox` group.
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the PAM module configuration file `/etc/gromox/pam.cfg` to point to a malicious shared object file they have placed on the file system.
- **PAM Invocation:** The vulnerability is triggered when a process uses the `pam_gromox.so` module, which will then load and execute the attacker's malicious plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- **`gromox` Group Membership:** The attacker must be a member of the `gromox` group to have write access to the vulnerable directory and config file.
- **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know about PAM modules, shared objects, and be able to manipulate files and configuration.

**Fix:**

The fix was implemented by restricting plugin loading to a fixed list and root-controlled paths, and making the `/etc/gromox` folder owned by root:root with mode 755.

This effectively prevents the unprivileged `gromox` group from controlling the execution of shared objects in the PAM module.
