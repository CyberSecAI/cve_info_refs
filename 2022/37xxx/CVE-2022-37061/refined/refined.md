Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-37061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `shell_exec` function calls in the `res.php` and `palette.php` files of the FLIR AX8 thermal camera firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Unsanitized HTTP GET/POST parameters are passed directly to the `shell_exec` function, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Specifically:
  - In `res.php`, the `$_POST["resource"]` parameter is used in the command: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/FLIR/usr/lib /FLIR/usr/bin/rls -o ".$_POST["resource"]`.
  - In `palette.php`, the `$_POST["palette"]` parameter is used in the command: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/FLIR/usr/lib /FLIR/usr/bin/palette ".$_POST["palette"]`.

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is accessible without authentication, making it easier to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the device with root privileges.
- **System Access:** Complete control of the compromised system is gained.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary impact, a DoS condition can be achieved by exploiting the vulnerability to overload the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** The attack vector is through crafting malicious HTTP GET or POST requests containing the injected commands in the `resource` (for `res.php`) or `palette` (for `palette.php`) parameters.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FLIR AX8 device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable device over the network.
- **No Authentication Required:** No user authentication is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to send HTTP GET/POST requests.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** Firmware versions 1.32.16 and 1.17.13 are confirmed to be vulnerable, running on `neco_v1.8-0-g7ffe5b3` operating system.
- **Exploitation:** A Python-based Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit named `flir_ax8_root.py` is available, demonstrating the practical exploitability.
- **Vendor Response:** The vendor was contacted, and a coordinated public security advisory was released after patches were developed and updates were being made to align to cyber security guide.
