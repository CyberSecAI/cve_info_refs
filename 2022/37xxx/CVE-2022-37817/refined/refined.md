The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in the Tenda AX1803 (V1.0.0.1) router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `fromSetIpMacBind` function, where the input `list` parameter is copied to a local array `v20` using the `strcpy` function without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability due to the use of `strcpy` without proper input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve a denial-of-service (DOS) by sending a crafted payload that overwrites the return address.
- More critically, by hijacking the PC registers, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code and obtain a stable root shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to `/goform/SetIpMacBind` with a crafted `list` parameter in the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. This implies network access to the device, either from the local network or, potentially, remotely if the router's administration interface is exposed to the internet.
