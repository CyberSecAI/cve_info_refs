php artisan make:addon pyro.module.products

# Create a stream within your module:
php artisan make:stream products pyro.module.products

# Install it using full addon notation (recommended):
php artisan addon:install pyro.module.products --seed
# or the short notation:
php artisan module:install products --seed

# Migrate changes as you build up the module:
php artisan addon:reinstall pyro.module.products --seed

```
