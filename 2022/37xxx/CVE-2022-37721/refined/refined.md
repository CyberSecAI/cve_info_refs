Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization of user-supplied content in blog posts. Specifically, HTML and Javascript code is not filtered, allowing a low-privileged user to insert malicious scripts into a blog post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious javascript code into a blog post.
- When a victim visits the blog post, the attacker's malicious script is executed in the victim's browser.
- This can lead to full admin account takeover or privilege escalation by hijacking the session of an administrator who views the malicious blog post.
- The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies, or redirect to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A low-privileged user (e.g., an author) injects malicious HTML and JavaScript payload within a blog post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs an account with the ability to create blog posts within the vulnerable PyroCMS instance.
- The attacker does not need to directly interact with the victim, as the malicious script is stored and triggered when the victim views the compromised blog post.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided advisory states that there was no official patch released by the vendor at the time of the report.
- The vulnerability affects versions prior to 3.9.1.
- The CVSSv3 base score is 8.7, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
