- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TOTOLink A7000R router firmware. The `sprintf` function is used to format user-supplied input (`ip`) into a buffer, `V6`, without proper size validation, which leads to a stack overflow if the input is too large.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of bounds checking on user-supplied input when formatting a string with `sprintf`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By sending a crafted HTTP POST request with an overly long value for the "ip" parameter, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing arbitrary code execution and potentially gaining a root shell on the router.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint, where the `ip` parameter contains a long string to overflow the buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, meaning they either need to be on the same network as the router or have access to its web interface through port forwarding.
