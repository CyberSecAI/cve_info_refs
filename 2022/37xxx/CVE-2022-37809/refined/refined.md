The provided content is related to CVE-2022-37809.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `formSetSpeedWan` function of Tenda AC1206 (V15.03.06.23) firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `sprintf` function is used to format the user-controlled input `speed_dir` with `%s` strings and save the result into a buffer called `ret_buf`. There is no bounds checking on the size of `speed_dir` before using `sprintf`, making it vulnerable to stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By sending a specially crafted `speed_dir` parameter in the HTTP POST request, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, leading to a denial-of-service (DOS) condition.
- The attacker can also hijack the Program Counter (PC) register.
- Ultimately, a stable root shell can be obtained by crafting the payload appropriately.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted `speed_dir` parameter in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Tenda AC1206 router.
- The attacker should have some knowledge about the device's firmware and the stack overflow vulnerability, as well as HTTP requests.
