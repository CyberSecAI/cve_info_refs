Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-37060 (Note: While the CVE is listed as a reference, the vulnerability described is from 2018.)

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The FLIR AX8 thermal sensor camera has an arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. Specifically, the 'file' parameter in `download.php` is not properly checked before being used to download files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to access any file on the system that the webserver user has access to, without any authentication.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The 'file' parameter is not sanitized, allowing the attacker to specify absolute file paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Exposure of System Information:** Attackers can potentially access configuration files and other sensitive system information.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Attackers may gain access to potentially confidential data stored on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `download.php`, including the 'file' parameter with the absolute path of the file they want to disclose.
- The vulnerability is both local and remote.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning a remote attacker can exploit this if they can reach the device.
- Knowledge of the file system structure of the device would be beneficial for the attacker in order to disclose specific files, but is not necessary.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content is primarily from a 2018 vulnerability advisory (ZSL-2018-5493), but it does reference CVE-2022-37060, indicating that it might be related or a duplicate. The CVE description was not retrievable in this submission, making it difficult to confirm the relationship, but it is likely this vulnerability.
- The advisory clearly states that the vulnerability was tested against firmware version 1.32.16 of the FLIR AX8 camera.
- The advisory also notes the vendor was notified, confirmed the vulnerability, and released patches.
- The vendor references several guides about cyber security which is linked in the advisory.
