- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of PDF files by PDF-XChange Editor. Specifically, crafted data within a PDF file can cause a read operation to occur beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially disclose sensitive information from the affected system's memory.
- Potential for further exploitation: The advisory notes that this vulnerability could be combined with other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file containing the specific data required to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
- User interaction: The target user must open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the malformed PDF data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create/deliver a malicious PDF: An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file containing the specially crafted data, and deliver the file to the victim.
- User interaction: The attacker needs the victim to open the malicious PDF file with PDF-XChange Editor.

**Additional notes:**
- The vendor, PDF-XChange, has released an update to address the vulnerability.
- The advisory was released on 2022-08-18, after being reported to the vendor on 2022-07-19.
