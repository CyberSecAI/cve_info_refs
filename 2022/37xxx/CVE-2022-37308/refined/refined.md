Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-37308:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way plain-text emails containing HTML code are handled when printing emails. The application fails to properly sanitize the HTML code within plain text emails before rendering them for printing.
*   **Weakness:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80). The application doesn't sanitize HTML within plain text emails when they are printed, allowing the injection of malicious script code.
*   **Vulnerable Component:** Frontend of OX App Suite.
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** OX App Suite version 7.10.6 and earlier.
*   **Fixed Versions:** 7.10.5-rev37, 7.10.6-rev16, and 8.3.
*    **Report confidence:** Confirmed
*   **Vendor notification:** 2022-06-22
*   **Solution date:** 2022-08-10
*   **Public disclosure:** 2022-11-24

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious script execution:** An attacker can inject malicious script code within a plain text email, and when a victim prints the email, the script will execute in the victim's browser context.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The executed script could be used to hijack the user's session by stealing cookies or tokens.
*   **Unwanted Actions:**  The attacker could trigger unwanted actions via the web interface of the application, such as redirecting the user to a third-party site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a plain text email that contains malicious HTML (specifically javascript) code
*   The attacker sends the malicious email to the victim
*   The victim prints the email which causes the malicious code to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send an email to the victim.
*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to print the email.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided PoC demonstrates the injection of an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` handler to trigger the execution of javascript.
*   The fix involves removing plain-text specific code and applying the existing sanitization mechanisms for HTML content.
