Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Incomplete exception handling during protobuf message generation. Specifically, when logging DNS responses with protobuf, certain crafted responses can trigger an exception that is not properly handled, leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of proper error handling when generating protobuf messages for DNS responses.
- The vulnerability exists in the `protobufServer` and `outgoingProtobufServer` functions when `logResponses=true`.
- Certain specific properties of a DNS response trigger the exception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). The PowerDNS Recursor can be brought down due to the unhandled exception.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker with access to the recursor. The attacker's IP address needs to be within the recursor's access control list.
- The attacker sends a crafted DNS query that results in a specific type of DNS response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must have network access to the recursor.
- Needs to be an allowed IP address according to the recursor's access control list.
- Able to send DNS queries to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is fixed in PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.5.10, 4.6.3, and 4.7.2.
- The vulnerability is present when `protobuf logging` is enabled and specifically when logging of responses is turned on with `logResponses=true`. If `logResponses` is not set, it defaults to `true`.
- Disabling protobuf logging of responses is a workaround.
