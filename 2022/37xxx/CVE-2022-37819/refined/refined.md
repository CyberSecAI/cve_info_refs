- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow exists in the `fromSetSysTime` function of Tenda AX1803 (V1.0.0.1) firmware. The `timeZone` value provided by the user is copied to a local buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking using the `strcpy` function.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow due to the usage of `strcpy` without proper size validation.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS): By sending an oversized `timeZone` parameter, the device can crash.
    - Arbitrary Code Execution: The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates the ability to hijack the PC register, implying that a carefully crafted payload could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution and gaining a stable root shell.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetSysTimeCfg` endpoint. Specifically, the `timeZone` parameter is used to exploit this vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs network access to the Tenda AX1803 router.
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface.
    - No authentication is mentioned as a requirement to trigger the vulnerability.
