`Describe：`
E-mes is an education management system of Thailand's basic education department. It has a serious SQL injection vulnerability, through which many sensitive information in the database can be obtained. This affects the whole e-mes version. As this is a system of the Thai government department, it can't be found on GitHub for the time being,I found a usage document in the government affairs section.

`Attack Vectors`

> A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the school information query interface (repschoolproj.php) of the EMS system of the Office of the Thai Basic Education Commission, which can lead to important data leakage.This website is owned by the Thai government, and if it is not repaired in time, it may lead to information leakage.
