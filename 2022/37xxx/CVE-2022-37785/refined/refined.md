The provided content relates to CVE-2022-37785.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The terminal plugin for WeCube Platform stores sensitive information, specifically the SSH password for accessing hosts, in cleartext within the configuration file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information. Passwords are not encrypted or hashed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who gains access to the configuration file can retrieve the cleartext SSH password and use it to establish unauthorized SSH connections to the target hosts, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Accessing the terminal plugin's configuration file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the configuration file where the cleartext password is stored. This could be achieved through various means like a compromised account, unauthorized file access, or other vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to read the configuration file.
