    "RELATED": true,
    "summary": "The application could be exposed to an Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability and crash when parsing certain PDF files or handling certain Annotation objects, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs as the application reads or writes data beyond the boundaries of an allocated object or buffer.",
    "root_cause": "Crafted data in a PDF file can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-Bounds Read"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files.",
      "Crafted data in a PDF file can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
