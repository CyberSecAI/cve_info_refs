- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs when parsing specially crafted DWG files. The application writes out of bounds past the fixed-length buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a specially crafted DWG file in Solid Edge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious DWG file using the vulnerable software. No special privileges are needed (PR:N), but user interaction is required (UI:R). The attack vector is local (AV:L).
