Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from direct SQL statement concatenation within the `/system/menu/list` interface of JFinal CMS 5.1.0. Specifically, the `order by` clause is directly appended with user-controlled input (`orderBy`) without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-supplied data into the `ORDER BY` clause, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** The injected SQL can be crafted to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `form.orderColumn` parameter when sending a POST request to `/jfinal_cms/admin/foldernotice/list`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `form.orderColumn`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Login:** The attacker needs to be logged into the application with an authenticated session (as evidenced by the need for a valid `JSESSIONID` and `session_user` cookie).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of vulnerable parameters**: The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `form.orderColumn` parameter.
