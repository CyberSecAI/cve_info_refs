- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the web management interface that allows a remote attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in a victimâ€™s browser within the context of the affected web interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed remotely through the web management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the web interface and the victim user needs to interact with the malicious content.
