  "CVE-2022-37239": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before outputting it in an HTTP response.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful XSS exploitation can expose user session cookies, allowing an attacker to hijack user sessions, gain account access, and impersonate users.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by injecting a malicious script payload (e.g., <script>alert(123)</script>) within a GET request when creating a rule. The injected script is then executed when the rule list is loaded.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the rule settings, or inject the payload through some other means. The attacker can then exploit the XSS via the rules list view. Access to the admin interface of the email server is required"
