Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-37368

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way PDF-XChange Editor handles Doc objects. Specifically, actions performed in JavaScript can trigger a read operation that goes beyond the allocated memory for a Doc object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
- Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information stored in adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can read potentially sensitive information from memory.
- Possible arbitrary code execution: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be leveraged alongside other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User interaction is required: The target user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file crafted by the attacker.
- JavaScript within a PDF document: The vulnerability is triggered by JavaScript code within the context of a PDF-XChange document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or control a malicious PDF file that, when opened in PDF-XChange Editor, executes malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker needs to entice the victim to open the specially crafted file.
