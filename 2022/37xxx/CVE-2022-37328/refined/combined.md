I like this plugin a lot so I bought it. After installation I tried to activate it and got a fatal error. I opened a ticket and they replied so a good sign. Unfortunately now a week has passed and I did not get any helpful response … actually any reply at all. Asked for a refund because as it is it’s a useless plugin and so far they seem to have disappeared! What a service!!!!! Let’s see if this review changes anything
