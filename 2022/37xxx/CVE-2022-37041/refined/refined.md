CVE-2022-37041

The provided content contains information regarding a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Zimbra's Proxy Servlet, which is identified as CVE-2022-37041.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Proxy Servlet, allowing a malicious actor to potentially make unauthorized requests to internal services.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation or sanitization in the Proxy Servlet, leading to an SSRF vulnerability. This allows a threat actor to send crafted requests to arbitrary internal endpoints that they would otherwise not have access to.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for the unauthorized access of internal services, which could potentially leak sensitive data or allow for further attacks.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted requests sent to the vulnerable Proxy Servlet.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Proxy Servlet endpoint, which may require some level of network access to the affected Zimbra server.
