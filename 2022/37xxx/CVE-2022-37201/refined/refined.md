Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from direct SQL statement concatenation in the `/system/menu/list` interface and other similar interfaces. The `orderBy` parameter is directly appended to the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the unsanitized inclusion of user-provided data (`form.orderColumn`) into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   Lack of input validation: The application does not validate or sanitize user-controlled inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Code execution:** The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited to potentially achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Information disclosure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP POST request.
*   **Specifically crafted HTTP POST request:** The request targets the `/jfinal_cms/admin/contact/list` endpoint (and potentially other similar endpoints) with malicious SQL code in the `form.orderColumn` parameter within the request body.
*   **Authentication required**: User login is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **User Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to access the vulnerable endpoints.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit uses `sqlmap` to automate the SQL injection process.
*   The `jfinal_cms` path may not always be necessary, so the attacker needs to determine the correct route.
*   The vulnerability exists because the `orderBy` clause in the SQL query is constructed using string concatenation.
*   The suggested solution involves using parameterized queries or implementing a whitelist to validate user inputs.
