Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-37360

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how PDF-XChange Editor parses Enhanced Metafile (EMF) files. Specifically, crafted data within an EMF file can trigger a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially leak sensitive information from the affected system's memory. This information can then be used for further attacks or to gain additional access.
- Possible Arbitrary Code Execution: While the primary impact is information disclosure, the advisory suggests this vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a malicious EMF file.
- User Interaction: The vulnerability requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing the crafted EMF data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious EMF file.
- The attacker must convince a user of the targeted software to either visit a malicious webpage or open a file that the attacker controls.
