- Malicious file: The attacker crafts a malicious JPG file that, when parsed by PDF-XChange Editor, triggers the out-of-bounds write.
- User interaction is required: The target user must open the malicious JPG file using the PDF-XChange Editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft malicious JPG files
- Ability to deliver a malicious file to the victim, or induce the victim to open the file (e.g. via a malicious website)
