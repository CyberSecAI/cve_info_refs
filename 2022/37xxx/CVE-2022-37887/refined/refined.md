- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in an underlying service of the SCALANCE W1750D device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow (CWE-120) caused by a buffer copy without checking the size of the input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending specially crafted packets to the PAPI UDP port (8211).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device's PAPI UDP port.
