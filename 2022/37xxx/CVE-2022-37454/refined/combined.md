Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-1ecc10276e
2022-11-03 15:57:26.843038

Name : php
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 8.1.12
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <http://www.php.net/>
Summary : PHP scripting language for creating dynamic web sites
Description :
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also
offers built-in database integration for several commercial and
non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

| Description The following code:  ``` <?php declare(strict_types=1);  class SessionHandlerTester implements \SessionHandlerInterface {      public function close(){return true;}      public function destroy($id){return true;}      public function gc($max_lifetime){return true;}      public function open($path, $name){return true;}      public function read($id){return '';}      public function write($id, $data){return true;}      //public function create_sid(){return uniqid();}      //public function validateId($key){return true;} }  $obj = new SessionHandlerTester(); ini_set('session.use_strict_mode','1'); session_set_save_handler($obj); session_start();  echo "\nvalidateId() ".(method_exists($obj,'validateId')?('returns '.($obj->validateId(1)?'true':'false')):'is commented out'); echo "\n"; $sessionId = session_create_id(); echo "\nSession ID:".$sessionId; echo "\n"; ```  Resulted in this output:  ``` [vagrant@local-test PHPUnit]$ php sessionCreateIdTest.php  validateId() is commented out PHP Warning:  session_create_id(): Failed to create new ID in /home/vagrant/sessionCreateIdTest.php on line 31  Session ID:   ```  But I expected this output instead:  ``` [vagrant@local-test PHPUnit]$ php sessionCreateIdTest.php  validateId() is commented out  Session ID:ismv386i33uasd5612o816ua54  ```  Here is a summary of the behavior of the above code across various versions, where I tested commenting out the `validateId()`, having it always return `false`, and have it always return `true`:   | Version | no `validateId()` | `validateId()` returns false | `validateId()` returns true | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 7.2.26 |  |  |  | | 7.2.34 |  | Error |  | | 7.4.30 | Error |  | Error | | 8.0.20 | Error |  | Error |   The varying behavior over time is believed to be due to two other bug fixes: [Fix #79091](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/f79c7742746907d676989cb7f97fb4f7cd26789f) and [Fix #79413](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/b510250b8ebe9d90b1db150d7a1edc75893f2e48)  (The older versions above are listed because they represent the progression of behavior as those fixes were applied. I know most are out of support.)  Those bug fixes created line 2325 below and changed `FAILURE` to `SUCCESS` on line 2323, respectively. (No problem with those bug fixes, them being fixed simply revealed this additional bug, and are merely provided for context.)     [php-src/ext/session/session.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/1084715494a1964f3caa69821cea636c75b2491d/ext/session/session.c#L2315-L2342)  Lines 2315 to 2342 in [1084715](/php/php-src/commit/1084715494a1964f3caa69821cea636c75b2491d)   |  | if (!PS(in\_save\_handler) && PS(session\_status) == php\_session\_active) { | | --- | --- | |  | int limit = 3; | |  | while (limit--) { | |  | new\_id = PS(mod)->s\_create\_sid(&PS(mod\_data)); | |  | if (!PS(mod)->s\_validate\_sid) { | |  | break; | |  | } else { | |  | /\* Detect collision and retry \*/ | |  | if (PS(mod)->s\_validate\_sid(&PS(mod\_data), new\_id) == SUCCESS) { | |  | zend\_string\_release\_ex(new\_id, 0); | |  | new\_id = NULL; | |  | continue; | |  | } | |  | break; | |  | } | |  | } | |  | } else { | |  | new\_id = php\_session\_create\_id(NULL); | |  | } | |  |  | |  | if (new\_id) { | |  | smart\_str\_append(&id, new\_id); | |  | zend\_string\_release\_ex(new\_id, 0); | |  | } else { | |  | smart\_str\_free(&id); | |  | php\_error\_docref(NULL, E\_WARNING, "Failed to create new ID"); | |  | RETURN\_FALSE; | |  | } |     Hypothesis I don't know for sure what the issue is, as I'm unfamiliar with the language the source code is written in, but here's is the best I can work out from clues:  Line 2319 contains the actual bug, as (I'm guessing here a little) that line is **meant** to check if the `validateId()` method exists on the save handler. If it does not exist, the code skips the collision check and just creates the new id without error (2335 is true).  However, that line doesn't actually do that, as it appears that `validateId()` is **always** defined and always returns `true` if the user defined save handler doesn't override it. (In other words, it claims that every ID is already in use.)  That may be due to the following code (again, guessing):   [php-src/ext/session/session.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/1084715494a1964f3caa69821cea636c75b2491d/ext/session/session.c#L1085-L1088)  Lines 1085 to 1088 in [1084715](/php/php-src/commit/1084715494a1964f3caa69821cea636c75b2491d)   |  | /\* Dummy PS module function \*/ | | --- | --- | |  | PHPAPI int php\_session\_validate\_sid(PS\_VALIDATE\_SID\_ARGS) { | |  | return SUCCESS; | |  | } |      As a result, 2319 is always `false`, so the 2321 `else` block always executes, and 2323 is always `true`, which always ends with `new_id = NULL` which after 3 loops lands the code at 2340, emitting the warning.  This explanation matches the chart of versions above:  7.2.26: With no `new_id = NULL` there was no way to fail  7.2.34 added `new_id = NULL` on 2325, which would cause 2323 to evaluate to true if `validateId()` returned `false`  Later versions then fixed 2323 to be true if `validateId()` returned `true`, which inverted (relative to 7.2.34) the behavior we see.  (I was unable to test other versions as I need to install PHP via `amazon-linux-extras`, which only on 7.2 allowed me to select which patch to install, didn't allow 7.3 at all, nor 8.1. Installing 7.4 and 8.0 got me 7.4.30 and 8.0.20.) Workaround A user can work around this issue by adding a `validateId($key)` to their user defined save handler. You just need to have it return `true` if the passed in `$key` is already in use, and `false` otherwise. See [documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/sessionupdatetimestamphandlerinterface.validateid.php). Comments I would imagine this bug is pretty widespread in general, as most user defined save handlers will not have a `validateId()` method defined (AWS PHP SDK doesn't, which is why I encountered this issue.) However, most code probably doesn't ever call `create_session_id()`, which means this problem is encountered extremely rarely.  (I think I failed at being "brief", so here's a 4 line TLDR. Sorry, I didn't want my many hours of digging to go to waste.) TLDR ``` ini_set('session.use_strict_mode','1'); session_set_save_handler(new SessionHandlerTester()); session_start();  session_create_id();  ```  Causes the following error if SessionHandlerTester doesn't have a `validateId()` method:  ``` PHP Warning:  session_create_id(): Failed to create new ID in <the last line>  ``` PHP Version 8.0.20 Operating System *No response* |

| This regression seems to have occurred in PHP 7.4.5: <https://3v4l.org/9HCPE>  7.4 is in security fixes only, but the fix should be provided for 8.0 upwards. |

| [@Girgias](https://github.com/Girgias) Won't your solution of changing the default value to FAILURE just cause the `php_session_initialize` function to fail? See line 421 and 426.     [php-src/ext/session/session.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/1084715494a1964f3caa69821cea636c75b2491d/ext/session/session.c#L420-L426)  Lines 420 to 426 in [1084715](/php/php-src/commit/1084715494a1964f3caa69821cea636c75b2491d)   |  | } else if (PS(use\_strict\_mode) && PS(mod)->s\_validate\_sid && | | --- | --- | |  | PS(mod)->s\_validate\_sid(&PS(mod\_data), PS(id)) == FAILURE | |  | ) { | |  | if (PS(id)) { | |  | zend\_string\_release\_ex(PS(id), 0); | |  | } | |  | PS(id) = PS(mod)->s\_create\_sid(&PS(mod\_data)); |      I tried returning `false` in my own code, initially, and discovered it was changing the session ID on every call, since `validateId` returns whether the ID is in use.  Since `php_session_initialize` uses `validateId` to check if the session record still exists, that means changing the default value will break things for everyone using a user defined save handler, not just those that call `session_create_id`. |

| Can you provide a test case for what you think might now fail? As all tests currently pass. I'm no session handler expert so I just read the description from the previous commits and thought this was the fix and because all tests passed merged. |

Most applications still use SHA-2 hashes (such as SHA256). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [PeterisP](user?id=PeterisP) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33282618)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33281871) | [next](#33282216) [–]  An obvious issue is that many protocols do two-sided negotiations of crypto algorithms during a handshake - so one of "most applications" which uses SHA-2 hashes by default could be vulnerable to a network connection saying "I don't support SHA-2, let's use SHA-3 pls?" and then exploiting the buffer overflow. In a similar manner, apps that verify signatures/certificates often let the certificate specify which algorithm is used, so again effectively an attacker may be able to force the app to use SHA3 as long as it uses a library that has some support for it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [londons\_explore](user?id=londons_explore) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33286361)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33282618) | [next](#33282216) [–]  > two-sided negotiations of crypto algorithms This is a common problem, and massively increases attack surface, since if a vulnerability can be found in *any* algorithm, it can be exploited. Downgrade attacks are a varient of the same. Let me present an alternative: Each protocol has *one specific* encryption algorithm and set of parameters. However, that set isn't fixed, but defined based on the current date and time. For example, HTTPS could be defined as "SHA1 from 1996 till 2006", "SHA256 from 2005 till 2018", "SHA3 from 2017 till 2032", etc. The dates can be written 10+ years into the future, so that software deployed today is still usable that many years into the future. As soon as the last date period expires, the software is not usable until it has been upgraded (unless both ends of the communication link choose to fake the date). There is precedent for software 'expiring' - that happens whenever the root certificate of a trust store reaches an expiry date. The downside is sometimes an algorithm might be broken before its date comes, and other times an algorithm may still be secure at that date. But that still seems better than our current mess of downgrade attacks. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GTP](user?id=GTP) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33287120)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33286361) | [next](#33282216) [–]  As you say, it could be that an algorithm gets broken before its "expiry date" or remains secure well past that (look e.g. at AES). There is a similar but better alternative, usually called "opnionated cryptography". A protocol specifies a single cryptographic primitive for each type needed (hash function, block cipher etc) so no negotiation is needed. If one of the primitives gets broken, a new version of the protocol is released that uses a different primitive. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kevincox](user?id=kevincox) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33287653)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33287120) | [next](#33288009) [–]  It seems to me that it may be better in many cases to support exactly two configurations (or some other small fixed number). This way there is no need to wait until a new version is released and dropping the vulnerable one won't cause any downtime. Ideally both codepaths would be regularly exercised (maybe clients should pick randomly when both choices are available). Then as soon as a vulnerability is discovered (maybe even before it is publicly revealed) all clients and servers could immediately drop support for the one that was discovered vulnerable. Then the release of a new configuration can be done slowly with reasonable caution to get back to the desired redundancy level. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [remram](user?id=remram) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33288009)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33287120) | [prev](#33287653) | [next](#33282216) [–]  And then you still have a roll-out period during which those two protocols are available, so the two parties still need to negotiate which version they want. It's not clear to me what the advantage over the current situation is? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GTP](user?id=GTP) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33288215)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33288009) | [next](#33282216) [–]  >the two parties still need to negotiate which version they want Not necessarily. If the client contacts the server using version X, the server will reply with version X. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [remram](user?id=remram) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33288788)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33288215) | [next](#33288358) [–]  What if the server doesn't support version X? Then the client will try again with version X-1. This is a negotiation, it is just an inefficient one (client might have to try X-1, X-2, X-3 in turn if more versions are still co-existing; and contrarily, if client doesn't support any version the server does, you will not get a detailed error about the version mismatch, because they are entirely different protocols). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GTP](user?id=GTP) [on Oct 22, 2022](item?id=33298961)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33288788) | [next](#33288358) [–]  >Then the client will try again with version X-1 Who says that? Either it is specified in the protocol, and then you're right that this is still a negotiation, or it is not specified in the protocol, so if the client does that is implementing some out of spec behavior. Which is true that already happened on the Internet for compatibility's sake, but keep in mind that there is still an advantage, as an adversary can't easily mess in the connection setup phase in a way that protocol version X looks like protocol version Y. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [remram](user?id=remram) [on Oct 23, 2022](item?id=33303385)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33298961) | [next](#33288358) [–]  If you don't have this downgrade, then clients can't talk with servers that haven't been upgraded yet! This means either that: \* you expect all servers to upgrade immediately, or at least faster than clients, or \* you delay upgrading clients you know to be insecure until servers had time to upgrade, or \* you are ok with breaking a significant portion of the network for every protocol update. Either way, your proposal makes no sense for the internet. Additionally, this is already possible with the current negotiation scheme. You can have clients refuse old algorithms (and they do). Your proposal doesn't improve anything there or anywhere else. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GTP](user?id=GTP) [on Oct 25, 2022](item?id=33331476)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33303385) | [next](#33288358) [–]  Negotiation makes the protocol more complicated, so more room for bugs. Additionally, sometimes (or maybe all times?) you need to explicitly configure a client or server to not accept broken algorithms during the negotiation, so you would need to keep track for yourself for which algorithms are safe to use and which are not. Anyway it would be interesting to look at how the Wireguard folks would handle this, as Wireguard is a protocol with opinionated crypto. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bhawks](user?id=bhawks) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33288358)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33288215) | [prev](#33288788) | [next](#33282216) [–]  That's sounds a lot like protocol negotiation, just implicit vs explicit and limited to 2 algos. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tinglymintyfrsh](user?id=tinglymintyfrsh) [on Oct 20, 2022](item?id=33282216)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33281871) | [prev](#33282618) | [next](#33282993) [–]  Rare != bad && rare != unimportant. The point of NIST standardizing on SHA-3 is to gradually replace SHA-2 due to the rise of computing power and the likelihood it will become as weak as SHA-1 is now in the near future. Unfortunately, like American credit cards vs. European chip & pin, it's going to take forever to adopt. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on Oct 20, 2022](item?id=33282442)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33282216) | [next](#33282375) [–]  No. The "rise in computing power" doesn't jeopardize SHA2. There are important design differences between SHA1 and SHA2 (here's where in my younger days I'd pretend that I could rattle off the implications of nonlinear message expansion off the top of my head). SHA2 is secure; don't take my word for it through, you can find one of the Blake2 designers saying SHA2 is unlikely ever to be broken, or Marc Stevens on a Twitter thread talking briefly about why his attacks on SHA1 don't apply at all to SHA2. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dlubarov](user?id=dlubarov) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33282695)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33282442) | [next](#33294697) [–]  I agree, SHA-2 is secure as far as we know. But since it's based on Merkle-Damgard, it permits length-extension attacks - i.e. given H(x), one can derive H(pad(x) || y) without knowing x. So we need to be careful not to use it in setting where that would be problematic. Or we can use it with workarounds, like double hashing (SHA-256d) or truncating its output. SHA-3 is sponge based, so its output is always truncated, preventing length-extension attacks. So I think SHA-3 is a better default, though it's fine to use SHA-2 if you know what you're doing. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [duskwuff](user?id=duskwuff) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33282867)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33282695) | [next](#33294697) [–]  Truncated SHA512 hashes, such as SHA512/256, defeat length extension attacks by omitting part of the hash state from the output. They're also significantly faster than classic SHA256 for large inputs. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [baby](user?id=baby) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33282998)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33282867) | [next](#33294697) [–]  Blake2/3 also doesn't suffer from length extension attacks, but SHA-256 is what everyone uses unfortunately. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dcow](user?id=dcow) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33285270)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33282998) | [next](#33294697) [–]  We use Blake 3. So far so good… | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tinglymintyfrsh](user?id=tinglymintyfrsh) [on Oct 22, 2022](item?id=33294718)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33285270) | [next](#33294697) [–]  I'm always leery when primitives mention their speed as a selling point because I'm thinking about the memory and CPU/GPU/ASIC costs required for adversary X years from now. Sure, one can hash or encrypt using N repeated rounds to up the cost but still: speed isn't everything. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [duskwuff](user?id=duskwuff) [on Oct 22, 2022](item?id=33295405)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33294718) | [next](#33311146) [–]  Outside of password hashing applications, which message digests like the SHA and Blake families aren't ideal for anyway, hash functions don't really derive their strength from being slow. If a hash is seriously broken -- in the kind of way that MD4 is, for example -- attacks against it may require so few operations that the speed of the hash doesn't matter at all. But, so long as the hash function remains unbroken, any attack against it requires so many operations as to make it completely infeasible, regardless of how fast it is. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dcow](user?id=dcow) [on Oct 23, 2022](item?id=33311146)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33294718) | [prev](#33295405) | [next](#33294697) [–]  Like the sibling says, speed is not really related to hash security. Either the hash is good at any speed or it’s broken. Speed is important if you’re hashing often. Systems that hash often, in my experience, tend to have a stronger security posture than systems that use bearer tokens. So… fast strong hashing is good for applications because it enables good crypto to be applied more thoroughly. And that’s why we use Blake3, fast strong hash/kdf/xof that we can use anywhere (from powerful servers to wasm) without much of a second thought. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tinglymintyfrsh](user?id=tinglymintyfrsh) [on Oct 22, 2022](item?id=33294697)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33282442) | [prev](#33282695) | [next](#33282375) [–]  SMH. You're conflating "broken" by mathematical attack and having enough computing power to brute it (GPUs or quantum). Rise in computing power *always* jeopardizes the baseline brute cost of every algorithm, which is why standards shift over time, otherwise 3DES would still be recommended for new applications instead of AES. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tialaramex](user?id=tialaramex) [on Oct 20, 2022](item?id=33282375)   | [root](#33281261) | [parent](#33282216) | [prev](#33282442) | [next](#33282993) [–]  "near future"?

It's like seeing clearly-syntactically-invalid code that somehow compiles anyway — you wonder what semantics the compiler could have possibly ascribed to it. Presumably this isn't not-crashing just because the developers of the Golang stdlib somehow found+fixed this bug back in 2015 when this assembler file was baked. The error is *in* that assembler code, I'm sure. It's presumably getting masked by something. (Something that may be benign, or might be subtly corrupting the runtime.) For a benign case: maybe the Golang runtime isn't allocating you precisely as many bytes as you're asking for, but rather a little bit more?

Because I have a Zen CPU (but that would also be true on Atom CPUs or Core CPUs since Ice Lake), I have to use "openssl dgst -r -sha256" instead of sha256sum and "openssl dgst -r -sha1" instead of sha1sum. The openssl implementation uses the hardware instructions where available and in that case it is several times faster.

Of these SHA-256 and SHA-512 are subject to the length extension attack (and SHA-224 only has 32-bit worth of safety which is clearly inadequate). Since you probably only needed a 256-bit hash, SHA-512/256 is a choice available today which produces a 256-bit hash without the possibility of length extension. Length extension works because the hash *is* the entire internal hash function state. This is not true for SHA-224, SHA-384, SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256 since for these four functions not all of the internal state is exposed. No, the length is not included at the start of the data to be hashed, this would mean committing to entire input before we hash it, which is a pretty unsatisfactory API, the length is appended (with the padding). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [a-dub](user?id=a-dub) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33282573)   | [root](#33281278) | [parent](#33282265) | [next](#33281484) [–]  > I think you've badly misunderstood what's going on here. that sounds right. been almost a decade since i've dug into sha-2. i do remember the lengths in sha-256 and sha-512 though and i remember not being a huge fan of the chunking/padding code. come to think of it, there's another reason for the message length in the padding. i forget what it is now. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [brundolf](user?id=brundolf) [on Oct 20, 2022](item?id=33281484)   | [prev](#33281278) | [next](#33281959) [–]  > The vulnerable code was released in January 2011, so it took well over a decade for this vulnerability to be found Ouch | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vermilingua](user?id=vermilingua) [on Oct 20, 2022](item?id=33282459)   | [parent](#33281484) | [next](#33281675) [–]  Took well over a decade for this vulnerability to be *disclosed*. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [galangalalgol](user?id=galangalalgol) [on Oct 20, 2022](item?id=33281675)   | [parent](#33281484) | [prev](#33282459) | [next](#33281959) [–]  Between this and "beacown" I came to a realization.

It absolutely is, and this kind of absolutism is what holds back the adoption of things like rust. In most real world software development, the target defect rate is not zero. The value proposition of something like rust for most businesses isn't that it lets you lower your defect rate; it's that it lets you maintain your existing (acceptable) defect rate at a much lower cost, by letting you drop your static analysis and most of your tests (reducing maintenance burdens) and still have a better bottom-line defect rate. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [consp](user?id=consp) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33284933)   | [root](#33281484) | [parent](#33283966) | [next](#33290568) [–]  So your assumption is that most to all defects are language related and not programmer error?

Errors where the program isn't doing what the programmer thought it should can generally be avoided by using more precise types.

It doesn't say to do away with coverage though, it simply talks about using good typing to make coverage easier to get with fewer tests.

So it's unlikely that other implementations (rush as Rust or Go) are vulnerable. I tested with the latest released and master branches of PHP, both of which segfaulted for the code samples mentioned in the article. The article says Python is also vulnerable.this is because both of the languages apparently use the reference implementation.

So for example in Rust you have a native slice type reflecting a dynamically sized view into a contiguous sequence, and of course it's safe -- five[20] will either refuse to compile if the compiler can see this slice is too short, or it will panic at runtime. In C++ as others have mentioned actually std::span just isn't safe when used ergonomically. five[20] in C++ is Undefined Behaviour. std::optional has a safe interface for a Maybe / Option type, but is presented with a more ergonomic unsafe behaviour and that's what people use. This is not an old-fashioned thing the C++ Committee grew out of, std::expected is in C++ 23, that's a Result type and it likewise offers an ergonomic unsafe API. The safe APIs were seen as a nice-to-have which could miss the train because who needs safety anyway?

The crucial trick is providing the unchecked operations (with improved performance) as unergonomic alternatives. \*(five.get\_unchecked\_mut(20)) = k; // looks *horrible*. Nobody wants to write that, so when they don't *need* it they won't write it. The fact calling get\_unchecked\_mut requires *unsafe* is part of how Rust could achieve its goals, but the choice to not make this ergonomic is why it actually delivers in practice. What CppFront wants here, and P2687 proposes, and lots of other C++ work has suggested, is roughly: ```   [[suppress(bounds_check)]] { five[20] = k; }  ``` Thus imitating what they *think* Rust does here, rather than what it actually did, and in the process completely missing the point. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pjmlp](user?id=pjmlp) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33291075)   | [root](#33284698) | [parent](#33289540) | [next](#33285334) [–]  Given that on some domains, there is no way around C or C++, unless one wants to be part of building the ecosystem, I was having big hopes on the clang and VC++ static analysis work for those kind of scenarios.

You cannot do that without breaking backward compatibility. If you maintain compatibility, what results is a sprawling meta-language with a large learning burden that has the theoretical ability to emulate a safe language, and which in practice will be used to mix both safe and unsafe idioms depending on the experience and discipline of the programmer, in an unholy mess that no static analyzer can prove as correct and no programmer can say they really fully understand. Maybe I'm mistaken, I've last programmed in C++ a good number of years ago, but I have not encountered a (C++ programming paradigm, static linter) doublet that can prove data integrity and thread safety to an extent even close to the Rust compiler.

For those wondering, here is an explanation by a commenter: ```     The padding change is the only difference, this allows future tree hashing modes as well as the current SHAKE outputs to generate different digests given the same security parameters and message inputs. Up to 4 additional bits are added, which keeps the full padding inside a byte boundary, making implementations with octet only input able to switch to SHA-3 from Keccak with change to only a single line of code.  ``` [https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10645/are-nists-c...](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10645/are-nists-changes-to-keccak-sha-3-problematic) [https://cdt.org/insights/what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-nist...](https://cdt.org/insights/what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-nist%E2%80%99s-cryptographic-standard-sha-3/) ketccak team's response: <https://keccak.team/2013/yes_this_is_keccak.html> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nullc](user?id=nullc) [on Oct 20, 2022](item?id=33282237)   | [parent](#33281419) | [next](#33282930) [–]  Who actually wrote the faulty code?

It would have already been a big deal for the past five years, if anything. Furthermore you have to induce a bufferoverflow first. I’m no security researcher, but to my mind that means you’re either (a) trusting idiots to write sensitive code without a IT Sec team reviewing it, or (b) you’ve got a malicious actor on the inside, who can slip it past review. I’m sure there are plenty of other scenarios, but I’m saying it doesn’t feel likely by gut. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [UncleMeat](user?id=UncleMeat) [on Oct 22, 2022](item?id=33301245)   | [root](#33285236) | [parent](#33285300) | [next](#33281477) [–]  Absolutely not.

(safe) Rust writes actual bounds checks, so if you accidentally overflow a buffer in some case you never tested that compiles, it would just panic if the case you got wrong occurs in real life. A more specialised language like WUFFS doesn't write bounds checks, it just constrains all the buffer access variables, so when you write code that could overflow that doesn't compile, preventing this problem. There is a price for this, you can have code which you know, intellectually, never hits the case where say k = 5, but maybe the proof would be sixty pages of difficult maths, WUFFS just won't compile that code until you add handling for k = 5, too bad, safe Rust insists on behaving as though k *might* be 5 (e.g. inserting runtime checks), unsafe Rust would allow you to YOLO, with a lot of hoop jumping, C++ doesn't care. Of course if your sixty page proof is *wrong* then these outcomes feel very different... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [green\_on\_black](user?id=green_on_black) [on Oct 21, 2022](item?id=33284994)   | [root](#33281477) | [parent](#33282136) | [next](#33282336) [–]  It seems that some memory safety bug in C/C++ makes HN frontpage every other day. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wongarsu](user?id=wongarsu) [on Oct 20, 2022](item?id=33282336)   | [parent](#33281477) | [prev](#33282136) | [next](#33282153) [–]  Rust code already exclusively uses rust ports of the library.

# SHA-3 Buffer Overflow

**Update:** This result appeared in the proceedings of CT-RSA 2023. A [preprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/331.pdf) is available.

Over the past few months, I’ve been coordinating the disclosure of a new vulnerability that I’ve found. Today is the disclosure date, so I am excited that I can finally talk about what I’ve been working on! The vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-37454](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37454) and bug reports are available for [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98517), [PHP](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=81738), [PyPy](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/860b897b2611a4099ef9c63ce848fdec89c74b31), [pysha3](https://github.com/tiran/pysha3/issues/29), [SHA3 for Ruby](https://github.com/johanns/sha3/issues/17), and [XKCP](https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP/security/advisories/GHSA-6w4m-2xhg-2658).

The vulnerability impacts the [eXtended Keccak Code Package (XKCP)](https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP), which is the “official” [SHA-3](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/hash-functions/sha-3-project) implementation by its designers. It also impacts various projects that have incorporated this code, such as the [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/) scripting languages.

Perhaps the best way to introduce the vulnerability is to give a short proof of concept.

On an older (vulnerable) implementation, the following Python script will generate a segmentation fault:

```
import hashlib
h = hashlib.sha3_224()
h.update(b"\x00" * 1)
h.update(b"\x00" * 4294967295)
print(h.hexdigest())
```

And the same code in PHP is as follows:

```
<?php
$ctx = hash_init("sha3-224");
hash_update($ctx, str_repeat("\x00", 1));
hash_update($ctx, str_repeat("\x00", 4294967295));
echo hash_final($ctx);
?>
```

(The scripts use quite a bit of memory, so it may happen that the Out Of Memory (OOM) killer will terminate the process.)

The reason for the segmentation fault is that the scripts will attempt to write more data to a buffer than it can hold. Such a vulnerability is known as a [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow), which [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) describes as “[probably the best-known form of software security vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow).”

A small variant of the code will cause an infinite loop: just replace 4294967295 with 4294967296. Note the similarity with [CVE-2019-8741](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-8741), another vulnerability that I found that affected the firmware of over 1.4 billion Apple devices, which also caused an infinite loop.

This type of behavior is not supposed to happen for “safe” languages such as Python and PHP, as they check that all read and write operations are within the bounds of the buffer. However, the problem is that the vulnerability is present in the underlying “unsafe” C language…

I’ve shown how this vulnerability in XKCP can be used to violate the [cryptographic properties of the hash function](https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf) to create preimages, second preimages, and collisions. Moreover, I’ve also shown how a specially constructed file can result in arbitrary code execution, and the vulnerability can also impact signature verification algorithms such as [Ed448](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/5/draft) that require the use of SHA-3. The details of these attacks will be made public at a later date.

The vulnerable code was released in January 2011, so it took well over a decade for this vulnerability to be found. It appears to be difficult to find vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations, even though they play a critical role in the overall security of a system. (Perhaps people are not even looking for such vulnerabilities, as neither this vulnerability in XKCP nor the [Apple vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-8741) mentioned earlier are eligible for any bug bounty program!)

So this is just the beginning… Expect more to come as soon as I can disclose other vulnerabilities that I’ve found!

## Description

![@botovq](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11229187?v=4&size=48)[botovq](https://github.com/botovq)opened [on Oct 21, 2022](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98517#issue-1418297175)

[CVE-2022-37454](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37454) affects Python versions prior to 3.11. The fix discussed in [XKCP's advisory](https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP/security/advisories/GHSA-6w4m-2xhg-2658) can be adapted to these versions. The [discoverer's writeup](https://mouha.be/sha-3-buffer-overflow/) contains code that might be turned into regression tests.

Python 3.11 and later switched to using tiny\_sha3 in [GH-32060](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/32060), so they should not be affected.

# Buffer overflow in sponge queue functions

Moderate

[gvanas](/gvanas)
published
GHSA-6w4m-2xhg-2658
Oct 20, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

Before commit fdc6fef075f4e81d6b1bc38364248975e08e340a

## Patched versions

Starting from commit fdc6fef075f4e81d6b1bc38364248975e08e340a

## Description

This vulnerability has been found by Nicky Mouha.

### Impact

The Keccak sponge function interface accepts partial inputs to be absorbed and partial outputs to be squeezed. A buffer can overflow when partial data with some specific sizes are queued, where at least one of them has a length of 2^32 - 200 bytes or more.

### Patches

Yes, see commit [fdc6fef0](https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP/commit/fdc6fef075f4e81d6b1bc38364248975e08e340a).

### Workarounds

The problem can be avoided by limiting the size of the partial input data (or partial output digest) below 2^32 - 200 bytes. Multiple calls to the queue system can be chained at a higher level to retain the original functionality. Alternatively, one can process the entire input (or produce the entire output) at once, avoiding the queuing functions altogether.

### References

See [issue #105](https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP/issues/105) for more details.

Moderate

## Description

### Impact

The Keccak sponge function interface accepts partial inputs to be absorbed and partial outputs to be squeezed. A buffer can overflow when partial data with some specific sizes are queued, where at least one of them has a length of 2^32 - 200 bytes or more.

### Patches

Yes, see commit [fdc6fef0](https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP/commit/fdc6fef075f4e81d6b1bc38364248975e08e340a).

### Workarounds

The problem can be avoided by limiting the size of the partial input data (or partial output digest) below 2^32 - 200 bytes. Multiple calls to the queue system can be chained at a higher level to retain the original functionality. Alternatively, one can process the entire input (or produce the entire output) at once, avoiding the queuing functions altogether.

## Description

![@botovq](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11229187?v=4&size=48)[botovq](https://github.com/botovq)opened [on Oct 21, 2022](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98517#issue-1418297175)

[CVE-2022-37454](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37454) affects Python versions prior to 3.11. The fix discussed in [XKCP's advisory](https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP/security/advisories/GHSA-6w4m-2xhg-2658) can be adapted to these versions. The [discoverer's writeup](https://mouha.be/sha-3-buffer-overflow/) contains code that might be turned into regression tests.

Python 3.11 and later switched to using tiny\_sha3 in [GH-32060](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/32060), so they should not be affected.

| Clearly this backport module is unmaintained these days. But there are still things using it (like <https://github.com/opentimestamps/python-opentimestamps>).  There was a security issue ([CVE-2022-37454](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6w4m-2xhg-2658 "CVE-2022-37454")) found in the Keccak implementation bundled, see: [python/cpython#98527](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/98527) |

| Yes, this package is affected by the buffer overflow. However I'm retiring the project. Any project should use SHA-3 from Python's hashlib module instead. |

| Done the rebase and did some clean-up for the support for `void` at the same time (and add `static` although unlikely).  I also don't really understand the purpose of the `format_type_if_object_or_pseudo_text()` function. |

There's a `format_void()` methodas well, which apparently renders void return types.

Hum, I don't really know how to do this frankly, because from my understanding this works on the XML? So I would imagine it gets initially rendered with links like `A|null` before getting transformed again?

And I'll drop void then, didn't know it was already handled

yeah, phd converts XML to HTML, but in case of simple nullable types, I had to discard the render of the null subtype, and insert a `<span class="type">?</span>` before the other subtype of the union type gets rendered. So what I wanted to ask you is to add the href directly to these HTML tags as well.

`format_type()` doesn't call `format_type_text()` so I didn't update it as I imagine this is already not displaying links.

`format_type()` is only called for rendering the tag itself, but `format_type_text()` is automatically called for the text inside the type tags. Now, that you changed `format_methodsynopsis()`, `?` has the link at the return type positions, but since `format_type_text()` was left out, `?` at parameter positions`are missing the links.

There's still another problem with simple nullable parameters:

```
/* Methods */
public __construct(
    ? $locale,
    int $dateType,
    int $timeType,
    IntlTimeZone|DateTimeZone|string|null $timezone = null,

Frankly I do not understand how the fuck these method call happen, so I have no clue if what I'm doing makes any sense. When I opened this PR initially it was just after a commit which broke the generation of the links, so I looked at this and tried to fix it. But I have ZERO understanding of PhD, and just trying to figure out how shit works here is... painful.

It's a bit better now: `?` characters both at the parameter as well as the return type position have the link. However, neither `void`, not `false` have them. As mentioned previously, you can add the link directly to the former one at phpdotnet/phd/Package/Generic/XHTML.php:1045, but I'm not sure what to do with `false`.

In order to fix the issue with the disappearing type in case of simple nullable types, you have to apply the following patch:

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

#### Threats

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.

If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

Summary : PHP scripting language for creating dynamic web sites
Description :
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also
offers built-in database integration for several commercial and
non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

### **[gvanas](/gvanas)** commented [Oct 20, 2022](#issue-1416540738)

| In some parts of the code, the comparison between a caller-provided size and a small value is incorrectly written. For instance, in `SpongeAbsorb()` (see `KeccakSponge.inc`), the comparison is written as `partialBlock + instance->byteIOIndex > rateInBytes`, where `partialBlock` depends on the caller-provided size, `rateInBytes` is a (small) constant and `instance->byteIOIndex` is never greater than `rateInBytes`. If `partialBlock` is close to the limit, the problem is that `partialBlock+instance->byteIOIndex` can overflow, yielding a number smaller than `rateInBytes` and the comparison is flawed. Instead, it should be written as `partialBlock > rateInBytes - instance->byteIOIndex`, where the right hand side never underflows since `instance->byteIOIndex` is never greater than `rateInBytes`.  Additionally, there are a couple of incorrect castings, like `(unsigned int)(dataByteLen - i)` that can cause an overflow when `size_t` is 64-bit.  Consequently, a buffer overflow can occur. For instance, in `SpongeAbsorb()`, the flawed comparison with a large value for `partialBlock` causes an overflow in the subsequent call to `SnP_AddBytes`. |

## Abstract

This paper describes a vulnerability in several implementations of the Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3) that have been released by its designers. The vulnerability has been present since the final-round update of Keccak was submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SHA-3 hash function competition in January 2011, and is present in the eXtended Keccak Code Package (XKCP) of the Keccak team. It affects all software projects that have integrated this code, such as the scripting languages Python and PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The vulnerability is a *buffer overflow* that allows attacker-controlled values to be eXclusive-ORed (XORed) into memory (without any restrictions on values to be XORed and even far beyond the location of the original buffer), thereby making many standard protection measures against buffer overflows (e.g., canary values) completely ineffective. First, we provide Python and PHP scripts that cause segmentation faults when vulnerable versions of the interpreters are used. Then, we show how this vulnerability can be used to construct second preimages and preimages for the implementation, and we provide a specially constructed file that, when hashed, allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim’s device. The vulnerability applies to all hash value sizes, and all 64-bit Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, and may also impact cryptographic algorithms that require SHA-3 or its variants, such as the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) when the Edwards448 curve is used. We introduce the Init-Update-Final Test (IUFT) to detect this vulnerability in implementations.

## Notes

1. 1.

   As we will explain in Sect. [3.1](#Sec4), the length of the message is *not* part of the padding. This property will be useful for our attacks.

## A Proof of Concept Code

### A Proof of Concept Code

Below we provide proof-of-concept code that runs with little to no modification (assuming the necessary packages are installed) on a 64-bit Ubuntu Linux platform. The proof of concept script will attempt to set up a Python crash, a PHP crash, a second preimage, a preimage of zero, a preimage of an attacker-chosen value, and a buffer exploit on a file hashing tool. The script assumes docker is installed with access to a non-root user. As explained below, the location of the return address and the attacker’s IP address may need to be modified for the attack to work.

Expected output:

# python-opentimestamps

Python3 library for creating and verifying OpenTimestamps proofs.

## Installation

From the PyPi repository:

```
pip3 install opentimestamps

```

## Structure

Similar to the author's `python-bitcoinlib`, the codebase is split between the
consensus-critical `opentimestamps.core.*` modules, and the
non-consensus-critical `opentimestamps.*` modules. The distinction between the
two is whether or not changes to that code are likely to lead to permanent
incompatibilities between versions that could lead to timestamp validation
returning inconsistent results between versions.

## Unit tests

```
python3 -m unittest discover -v

```

Additionally Travis is supported.

## SSL Root Certificates

On some MacOS setups SSL certificates may be missing. The following commands
could be of use to resolve this error (the below example assumes a user is
running Python "3.7", and is using Certifi package):

```
cd /Applications/Python\ 3.7
Install\ Certificates.command

```

Seems like the buffer overflow would be triggered for any file larger than 4 GiB I skimmed the paper, and as far as I understood it: Most cryptographic hash functions operate in fixed-size blocks (for instance, 32 bytes). Additionally, most cryptographic hash function implementations are designed to be streaming, that is, they do not receive the whole input at once. If you give them a partial input which is not a multiple of their block size, these implementations have to buffer the partial input, so that it can be combined with the next partial input (or flushed, if the next call is to finish the computation and generate the output). The arithmetic overflow which leads to the buffer overflow happens when computing how much it has to buffer, given a partial input and any previous partial input already in its internal buffer. That is, having a file larger than 4GiB is not enough; it has to also be cut into pieces which are not a multiple of the block size (which is normally a power of two). Most users of a cryptographic hash function will either give it the input in large power-of-two pieces (for instance, 8 KiB or 64 KiB), or give it the input all at once, and thus will not hit the bug. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rurban](user?id=rurban) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35053563)   | [parent](#35051004) | [prev](#35051085) | [next](#35051368) [–]  You'd be surprised how many of those submitted and approved crypto standards are still not tested with industry best practices. buffer overflows or integer UB's and overflows are very common. ubsan, asan, valgrind tests are missing. some do offer symbolic verification of the algo, but not the implementations.

The effect of that is well-defined, and the cast is a pretty strong signal that the author is deliberately converting the value.

It may be these only happen if you compile as C++ and not as straight C? (I don’t do straight C much.) Of course you’ll run into dozens of instances of it with old C code… and my experience has been that some of those instances are bugs similar to this one. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [loup-vaillant](user?id=loup-vaillant) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35054932)   | [root](#35051376) | [parent](#35054173) | [next](#35053622) [–]  Here's the definite answer: ```   #include <stdio.h>      int main()   {    long long unsigned llu;    if (scanf("%llu", &llu) == EOF) {     printf("EOF!!\n");    }    printf("%llu\n", llu);       unsigned u = llu;    printf("%u\n", u);    return 0;   }  ``` Here's an execution run: ```   $ ./a.out    9876543210   9876543210 (llu)   1286608618 (u)  ``` I tried to compile it as C and C++, with both Clang (14.0.0) and GCC (11.3.0): ```   gcc     -Wall -Wextra              # no warning   g++     -Wall -Wextra              # no warning   clang   -Wall -Wextra              # no warning   clang++ -Wall -Wextra              # no warning   clang   -Wall -Wextra -Weverything # loss of precision warning   clang++ -Wall -Wextra -Weverything # loss of precision warning  ``` However, the warning goes away if there's an explicit cast: ```    unsigned u = (unsigned)llu;  ``` Worse, I *still* have no warning if I do the narrowing cast then affect it to a wider variable: ```    long long unsigned u = (unsigned)llu;    printf("%llu (u)\n", u);  ``` In C++ I'm warned about the old style cast of course, but using `static\_cast` makes the warning go away. And of course the code overflows just like before. I don't have a good solution to this. Sometimes I do want to lose the precision. Bignum arithmetic for instance. In any case, I'm pretty sure the Keccak team's compiler did not issue any warning. Sorry if I implied otherwise. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jonstewart](user?id=jonstewart) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35057079)   | [root](#35051376) | [parent](#35054932) | [next](#35053622) [–]  Thank you, I wanted to do this last night but haven’t had the time. I think it’s perfectly fine for an algorithm contest not to require a bugfree implementation… but I also feel that if we’re going to standardize on a cryptographic algorithm, throwing all the tools and formal methods we can at it during development of the reference implementation makes a lot of sense. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eterevsky](user?id=eterevsky) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35053622)   | [prev](#35051376) | [next](#35066206) [–]  I wonder if this could be avoided by writing the canonical implementations in Rust or better yet in some system with formal verification.

Sure the compiled code would be bounds-checked, but nobody would notice the bug unless they gave it the crashing input.

It's only easy in hindsight. Past 30+ years of collective experience in our industry shows that these classes of bugs are nearly impossible to completely stamp out in any language but especially in memory unsafe ones, even with dramatically better compile time and runtime tools that can spot many of these nowadays. During the early days of the internet and the buffer overflow attacks after Morris worm, buffer overflow bugs existed in practically all software. There were times when pretty much any servers connected to the internet could be had relatively easily. Even with memory safe languages, there are dangers. Humanity just hasn't figured out how to produce completely bug-free code at the scale we need in general, let alone in a memory-unsafe language. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [loup-vaillant](user?id=loup-vaillant) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35053278)   | [root](#35052277) | [parent](#35052491) | [next](#35054148) [–]  This particular mistake is all the more infuriating because it comes from a *precaution*. Or trying to silence a compiler warning: ```   partialBlock = (unsigned int)(dataByteLen - i);  ``` Where both `dataByteLen` and `i` where actually `size\_t`. Assuming this is close enough to C, what happens is that we're converting a difference between `size\_t` into a mere `unsigned`, and since they're not the same sizes on 64-bit platforms this can give `partialBlock` the wrong value, and the whole thing then snowballs into a catastrophic error that is not trivial to test because it only happens with huge buffer sizes. The biggest mistake here is having written `(unsigned int)` instead of `(size\_t)`. But the reason it happened in the first place is because they tried to do the right thing: writing the cast as a precaution, even though the following would have worked: ```   partialBlock = dataByteLen - i;  ``` I really can't fault them: because it was a difference it could theoretically yield a "negative" result, and therefore intuitively the type of a difference should be signed, so we should cast it back to unsigned to be crystal clear. I knew C was dangerous, but to be honest I didn't expect such a wicked mind game. Now I'm going to have to take a look at *my* code. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [junon](user?id=junon) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35053738)   | [root](#35052277) | [parent](#35053278) | [next](#35053336) [–]  > since they're not the same sizes on 64-bit platforms Not guaranteed, but they certainly can be. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [IYasha](user?id=IYasha) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35053336)   | [root](#35052277) | [parent](#35053278) | [prev](#35053738) | [next](#35054148) [–]  umm...

But some people might think that it could, so putting the cast could increase readability for them. A similar reasoning applies with operator precedence: even though it's very well defined, we tend to forget it, so instead we put additional parentheses. But in a couple specific cases it hurts more than it helps. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nayuki](user?id=nayuki) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35056966)   | [root](#35052277) | [parent](#35053336) | [prev](#35053415) | [next](#35054148) [–]  So, (unsigned int) - (unsigned int) → (unsigned int) is guaranteed on every platform. But relevant to the bad SHA-3 code, the resulting type of size\_t - size\_t can be surprising. First, size\_t is not guaranteed to have any relation with unsigned int; it could be narrower, the same, or wider. For example, size\_t could map to unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, or unsigned long long. If size\_t is defined as unsigned short (note that size\_t must be at least 16 bits), and short is 16 bits wide, and int is 32 bits wide, then the calculation of size\_t - size\_t will be promoted to (signed int) - (signed int), and thus the result will have the type signed int. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jongjong](user?id=jongjong) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35054148)   | [root](#35052277) | [parent](#35052491) | [prev](#35053278) | [next](#35053956) [–]  Agreed, people wildly underestimate how difficult it is to produce correct code. I think if people adopted the mindset that it's impossible, we'd be closer to the truth. Some of these important projects should only hire genius-level developers who code at a max speed of 1 line per day. Every line of code should be added with an unfathomable degree of thoughtfulness and care. I wish I was joking, but I'm not. Shipping a non-trivial program which has more than a few thousand lines of code borders on impossible. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GoblinSlayer](user?id=GoblinSlayer) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35053956)   | [root](#35052277) | [parent](#35052491) | [prev](#35054148) | [next](#35054263) [–]  Buffer overflow in hash function is unprecedented, buffering simply doesn't work this way, it was figured out long ago and never changed. Smells like bullrun to me. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [red\_admiral](user?id=red_admiral) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35054263)   | [parent](#35052277) | [prev](#35052491) | [next](#35052390) [–]  I'm going with "neither". It's true that Snowden revealed the NSA had their fingers in NIST's cryptographic standards team, with Dual-EC a specific example that is considered suspicious since the revelations. So a suspicion of malice is not completely unfounded, but as far as I can tell, this code was written by the Keccak team not NIST itself, and for any claim of "they're NSA stooges", I would need evidence. It also seems to me that the Keccak team are not stupid people. That leaves "honest mistake" as the most likely explanation. There are lots of studies on human behaviour that show a competent and diligent human will mess up every Nth time they perform a routine task; some forms of probabilistic risk analysis take N = 10^3 as a lower bound for this. There is a long history of railroad operation in the UK (who invented the steam train after all) where occasionally, a signaller would send an express onto a line where they'd forgotten that the local was standing, or two trains head-on down a single line in opposite directions. This led to the development of interlockings and token working systems as technological solutions to mitigate the risks of human error, and later on to today's computerised safety systems, because signallers are (almost always) neither stupid nor malicious, but still human. The same can be said for programmers. (As I understand, the recent train disaster in Greece was on a line where there should have been interlocking in place, but it wasn't active.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bilekas](user?id=bilekas) [on March 7, 2023](item?id=35052390)   | [parent](#35052277) | [prev](#35054263) [–]  > Buffer overflow, overwrite memory, run arbitrary code, seriously?

#### Paper 2023/331

### A Vulnerability in Implementations of SHA-3, SHAKE, EdDSA, and Other NIST-Approved Algorithms

Nicky Mouha[![](/img/orcid.svg)](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8861-782X), Strativia, Largo, MD, USA
Christopher Celi[![](/img/orcid.svg)](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9979-6819), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA
##### Abstract

This paper describes a vulnerability in several implementations of the Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3) that have been released by its designers. The vulnerability has been present since the final-round update of Keccak was submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SHA-3 hash function competition in January 2011, and is present in the eXtended Keccak Code Package (XKCP) of the Keccak team. It affects all software projects that have integrated this code, such as the scripting languages Python and PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that allows attacker-controlled values to be eXclusive-ORed (XORed) into memory (without any restrictions on values to be XORed and even far beyond the location of the original buffer), thereby making many standard protection measures against buffer overflows (e.g., canary values) completely ineffective. First, we provide Python and PHP scripts that cause segmentation faults when vulnerable versions of the interpreters are used. Then, we show how this vulnerability can be used to construct second preimages and preimages for the implementation, and we provide a specially constructed file that, when hashed, allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's device. The vulnerability applies to all hash value sizes, and all 64-bit Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, and may also impact cryptographic algorithms that require SHA-3 or its variants, such as the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) when the Edwards448 curve is used. We introduce the Init-Update-Final Test (IUFT) to detect this vulnerability in implementations.
