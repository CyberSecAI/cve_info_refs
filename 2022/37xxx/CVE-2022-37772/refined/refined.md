```
{
  "cveId": "CVE-2022-37772",
  "rootCause": "The application does not properly restrict the number of authentication attempts, allowing an attacker to perform a brute-force attack.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307)"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application by brute-forcing user credentials.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "The attacker sends multiple login requests to the `/user/login` endpoint with different password attempts."
  ],
  "attackerCapabilities": "No specific privileges are required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the login endpoint.",
    "additionalDetails": "The application provides verbose responses, including specific error messages for invalid credentials, locked accounts and successful logins. This information allows the attacker to easily distinguish between failed and successful login attempts, which can be exploited to improve the brute-force attack. The vulnerability exists whether or not a lockout policy is active. If a lockout policy is active, the application informs that the user account is locked out upon presentation of valid credentials."
