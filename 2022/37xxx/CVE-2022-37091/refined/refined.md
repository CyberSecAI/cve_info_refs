```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `EditWlanMacList` function uses `sscanf` with a greedy matching mechanism (`%[^;]`) without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow due to unchecked input length in `sscanf` function during parsing of parameters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve a stable root shell or cause a denial-of-service by sending a crafted payload, overwriting the stack.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD=EditWlanMacList` and a long, malicious string in the `param` field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, which implies network access to the vulnerable device."
