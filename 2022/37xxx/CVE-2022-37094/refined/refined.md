Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-37094.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `Edit_BasicSSID_5G` function of the H3C H200[H200-EI] (H200V100R004) router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `sscanf` function is used with a greedy matching mechanism (`%[^;]`) to parse user input (`param`).
- The size of the buffer used to store the parsed input is insufficient, leading to a stack buffer overflow when input exceeds its capacity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial of service (DOS) by crashing the device.
- By carefully crafting the payload, an attacker can gain a stable root shell on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to `/goform/aspForm` with a specific `CMD` parameter (`Edit_BasicSSID_5G`) and an overly long `param` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
- The attacker can achieve this by being on the same network as the device.
- The attacker needs to know the device's IP address and be able to send a malicious POST request with the vulnerable parameters.
