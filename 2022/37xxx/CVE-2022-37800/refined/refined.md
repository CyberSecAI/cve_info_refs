The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC1206 router firmware version V15.03.06.23.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `save_staticroute_data` function, which is called by `fromSetRouteStatic`. The `save_staticroute_data` function uses `sscanf` with a format string `"%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%s"` to parse user-provided input. This format string uses greedy matching, which allows an attacker to provide input larger than the allocated buffer size, resulting in a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to improper use of `sscanf` with a greedy format string.
- Lack of input validation or bounds checking within the `save_staticroute_data` function when parsing the input using `sscanf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By sending a crafted payload, an attacker can crash the device, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By carefully crafting the payload, it's possible to overwrite the return address on the stack, hijacking control flow and achieving arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to a root shell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint with a crafted `list` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router. This typically means being on the same local network as the router or having access through remote management (if enabled and not properly secured).
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication if this endpoint does not require it.
