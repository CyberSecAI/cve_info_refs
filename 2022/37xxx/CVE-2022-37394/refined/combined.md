# Compute service fails to restart if the vnic\_type of a bound port changed from direct to macvtap (CVE-2022-37394)

### Bug Description

We have a downstream bug report with the following reproduction steps:

1) create a neutron port with vnic\_type "direct"

2) create an instance with that port

3) after the instance is created successfully change the vnic\_type of the bound port from "direct" to "macvtap". This is accepted by Neutron

4) wait until the nova instance info caches is healed by the periodic task in nova-compute

5) restart the nova-compute service.

Actual behavior

---------------

The nova-compute service fails to start with PciDeviceNotFoundById exception pointing to the PCI address of the VF the port is bound to on the host.

Expected behavior

-----------------

The nova-compute service should start up successfully.

Sean: Can you elaborate on why you believe this report represents an exploitable security vulnerability? Is it that a malicious user can change the vnic\_type of a port under their control and leave a time-bomb for the next time the administrator restarts the compute service, resulting in that compute host being out of service (unable to stop/start running virtual machines) until the problem can be manually rectified?

I caught up with Sean in IRC and he confirmed the situation is basically as I inferred above (exploitable by any normal authenticated user, not just limited to operator level accounts).

Title: Compute service fails to restart if the vnic\_type of a bound port changed from direct to macvtap

Reporter: Balazs Gibizer (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Affects: >=23.0.0

Description:

Balazs Gibizer with Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova's restart behavior when a Neutron port type is changed from "direct" to "macvtap". By creating a neutron port with vnic\_type "direct", creating an instance bound to that port, and then changing the vnic\_type of the bound port to "macvtap" an authenticated user may cause the compute service to fail to restart resulting in a possible denial of service.

Only Nova deployments configured with SR-IOV are affected.

@David: Your summary look good to me.

@fungi: [https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/850003](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/%2B/850003) is proposed as a mitigation of the denial of service. With that patch nova will no longer fail to restart in the reported situation.

Thanks David!

Keep in mind that the title is what will appear in the list of advisories at <https://security.openstack.org/ossalist.html> and will be combined with the project name, OSSA number and CVE identifier in the subject line of advisories posted to widely-read public mailing lists, so shorter is better as long as it still uniquely captures the situation, sort of like a commit message title. Maybe something along the lines of "Changing vnic\_type breaks compute service restart" instead (50 characters).

For the affected versions, we assume that a fix will be backported to all stable series currently in a "managed" state (so Wallaby, Xena and Yoga in this case) and that stable point releases will be tagged to include those. Since the most recent point releases are 23.2.1, 24.1.1 and 25.0.1 we indicate that the next possible release number for each of these is not affected like so: <23.2.2, >=24.0.0 <24.1.2, >=25.0.0 <25.0.2 (if the next point release on stable/yoga ends up being 25.1.0 instead and there is never a 25.0.2 that's fine, since 25.1.0 still falls into an unaffected range strictly speaking).

David's proposed impact description from comment #9 looks perfect to me. If there are no immediate objections, VMT members can proceed in requesting a CVE assignment based on that description while the master branch fix is under review, and then work on assembling an advisory once backports have been pushed.

Gracefully ERROR in \_init\_instance if vnic\_type changed

If the vnic\_type of a bound port changes from "direct" to "macvtap" and

    then the compute service is restarted then during \_init\_instance nova

    tries to plug the vif of the changed port. However as it now has macvtap

    vnic\_type nova tries to look up the netdev of the parent VF. Still that

    VF is consumed by the instance so there is no such netdev on the host

    OS. This error killed the compute service at startup due to unhandled

    exception. This patch adds the exception handler, logs an ERROR and

    continue initializing other instances on the host.

Also this patch adds a detailed ERROR log when nova detects that the

    vnic\_type changed during \_heal\_instance\_info\_cache periodic.

Gracefully ERROR in \_init\_instance if vnic\_type changed

If the vnic\_type of a bound port changes from "direct" to "macvtap" and

    then the compute service is restarted then during \_init\_instance nova

    tries to plug the vif of the changed port. However as it now has macvtap

    vnic\_type nova tries to look up the netdev of the parent VF. Still that

    VF is consumed by the instance so there is no such netdev on the host

    OS. This error killed the compute service at startup due to unhandled

    exception. This patch adds the exception handler, logs an ERROR and

    continue initializing other instances on the host.

Also this patch adds a detailed ERROR log when nova detects that the

    vnic\_type changed during \_heal\_instance\_info\_cache periodic.

Even though the patch for stable/wallaby has not merged, we could go ahead and issue an advisory for this now that the branch has transitioned to extended maintenance. What does everyone think?
