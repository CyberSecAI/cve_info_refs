- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `TempFileResource` in dotCMS allows multiple calls to download large files. Repeated calls can exhaust the Tomcat Request Thread pool, leading to a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Resource exhaustion due to uncontrolled access to the `TempFileResource` endpoint. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `TempFileResource` does not limit the number of concurrent downloads, allowing an attacker to overwhelm the server by requesting multiple large files simultaneously.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, preventing the server from processing legitimate requests. The Tomcat Request Thread pool is exhausted, making the application unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending multiple requests to the `/api/v1/temp/byUrl` endpoint, each requesting the download of a large file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `/api/v1/temp/byUrl` endpoint. No special access or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, unless `TEMP_RESOURCE_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` is set to `false`. The attacker can be external.
