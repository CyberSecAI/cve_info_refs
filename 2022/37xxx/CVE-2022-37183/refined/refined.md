The provided content relates to CVE-2022-37183.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application copies the value of the `created-monthly-list` request parameter into an HTML tag attribute without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code via a crafted URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation/sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement
- Redirection to malicious websites
- Other malicious actions if a user interacts with the crafted URL

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `created-monthly-list` parameter.
- The attacker tricks a user into visiting this URL, usually through social engineering (e.g. phishing).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a crafted URL with the malicious payload.
- The attacker must convince a user of the vulnerable system to click the link.
