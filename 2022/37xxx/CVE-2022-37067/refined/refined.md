- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack overflow in the `UpdateWanParamsMulti` function due to insufficient bounds checking when copying user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `strncpy` function is used to copy the data, but it does not prevent buffer overflows if the source data is larger than the destination buffer. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because the size of user-provided input (`s` parameter), copied to `V17`, is not checked against the size of `V17`.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the device.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution by crafting a specific payload to overwrite the return address on the stack, leading to gaining a root shell.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint, with a large string in the `param` field of the `UpdateWanParamsMulti` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
