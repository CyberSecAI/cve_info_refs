The provided content describes a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC15 firmware version V15.03.05.18, specifically within the httpd server's `/goform/formWifiBasicSet` endpoint.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcpy` to copy the user-supplied `security_5g` parameter to a stack buffer without any length checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow
- Lack of input validation/sanitization
- Use of unsafe string copy function `strcpy`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker to overwrite stack memory.
- Can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
- May result in denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formWifiBasicSet` endpoint with an overly long `security_5g` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, indicating they would need network access to the device.
- The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.
