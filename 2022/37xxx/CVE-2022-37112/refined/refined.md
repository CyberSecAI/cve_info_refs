- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin/model.php` file of Bluecms V1.6. Specifically, the `$_GET['model_id']` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `admin/model.php` file, specifically at line 55. The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection because the injected SQL queries do not produce output, but the server response time changes based on the queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a blind SQL injection. This allows them to extract database information such as the version number, and potentially other sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request with a crafted `model_id` parameter, such as `act=del&model_id=sleep(1)`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No other specific privileges are mentioned, but it is implied that the attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable part of the application.
