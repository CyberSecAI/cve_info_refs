Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `TempFileAPI` in dotCMS attempts to block access to local IPs or private subnets when creating temporary files from a provided URL.
*   However, the API follows 302 redirects from the initial URL without re-validating the redirected URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The lack of re-validation on redirect URLs allows an attacker to bypass the initial block and access internal resources.
*   **Bypass of Access Restrictions:** The intended restriction on accessing local/private network resources is circumvented through the redirect mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve data from internal services (e.g., `https://elasticsearch:9200`) or other resources on the local/private network that should not be remotely accessible.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Depending on the internal services exposed, this could lead to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a URL that, upon access, returns a 302 redirect to an internal resource.
*   The attacker then uses the `TempFileAPI` in dotCMS to process the crafted URL.
*   dotCMS, without re-validating the redirect URL, fetches the internal resource and potentially returns its contents to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** The vulnerability requires admin access to exploit.
*   **Knowledge of Internal Network:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the internal network and potentially accessible resources to exploit this vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in dotCMS version 5.2.0.
*   Versions before 5.2.0 are not affected.
*   The fix is available in dotCMS versions 22.08+, LTS 21.06.12+, and LTS 22.03.4+.
*   A mitigation is suggested to use a WAF to prevent POST requests to the `/api/v1/temp/byUrl` endpoint.
