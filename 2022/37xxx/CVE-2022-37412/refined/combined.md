### [Does the minimum; no option to select which revisions to keep](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-the-minimum-no-option-to-select-which-revisions-to-keep/)

This plugin basically does as described, but it‚Äôs all or nothing. There is only one screen, and you can only delete EVERY revision, or none. There should be checkboxes. And there should also be a ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button added to each revision when editing a post, like it‚Äôs done with ‚ÄúThin Out Revisions‚Äù plugin.
