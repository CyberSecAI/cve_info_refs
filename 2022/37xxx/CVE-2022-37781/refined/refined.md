Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-37781.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `fdkaac` project, specifically related to how it extrapolates samples and a floating-point exception related to a malformed WAV file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Heap-buffer-overflow:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `aacEncEncode` function when processing a crafted input file. This happens because the extrapolator returns more samples than required.
2.  **Floating-Point Exception:** A floating-point exception (FPE) vulnerability occurs in the `wav_open` function when processing a malformed wav file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Heap-buffer-overflow:** This can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if successfully exploited. The provided ASan output shows a read of size 4 at an address outside the allocated buffer.
2.  **Floating-Point Exception:** This causes the program to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted input file to the `fdkaac` executable. Specifically, the user provides a file through the `-p5` parameter and sets a bitrate using the `-b64` parameter, then directs the output to `/dev/null`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted input file to the `fdkaac` executable. This means they need to be able to execute the `fdkaac` program with the malicious input.
