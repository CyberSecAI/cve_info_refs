        "content": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of Doc objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process."

    ],
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the existence of Doc objects before performing operations on them, leading to a use-after-free condition. Additionally, multiple sources indicate that use of wild pointers or null pointers without proper validation when handling various objects such as AcroForms, checkbox fields, annotation objects, or during JavaScript execution, cause a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free",
     "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. It may also lead to information disclosure or application crash.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited when a user opens a malicious PDF file or visits a malicious page.",
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted PDF file or a malicious webpage. User interaction is needed to open the crafted file or visit the malicious page."
