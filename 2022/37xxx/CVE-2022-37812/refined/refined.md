{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function in the `formSetFirewallCfg` function, which copies the user-controlled `firewallEn` parameter into a fixed-size buffer `firewall_buf` without any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries and overwrite adjacent stack data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow due to the usage of `strcpy` without proper bounds checking.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DOS) attack by crashing the device and can achieve arbitrary code execution by hijacking the PC register leading to a stable root shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetFirewallCfg` endpoint with an oversized value for the `firewallEn` parameter. The request needs to be sent to the web interface of the Tenda AC1206 router.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web interface of the vulnerable Tenda AC1206 device."
