```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The IOTransfer Updater service (IOTUpdaterSvc) has an unquoted service path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unquoted service path vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can gain elevated privileges by placing a malicious executable in a directory that is part of the unquoted service path. When the service starts, Windows will attempt to execute the malicious executable if it exists, before the actual service executable is reached.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to place a malicious executable in a path that is part of the unquoted service path. This path is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IOTransfer\\Updater\\, due to the service binary path being C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IOTransfer\\Updater\\IOTUpdater.exe",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have write access to the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IOTransfer\\ directory or any parent directory to place the malicious executable. The attacker also needs to be able to trigger the restart of the service to activate the exploit."
