- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mendix SAML module insufficiently protects from packet capture replay.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass due to lack of proper replay protection. The vulnerability is present when the "Allow Idp Initiated Authentication" configuration option is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized remote attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can capture and replay network packets to bypass authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic related to SAML authentication and replay it.
