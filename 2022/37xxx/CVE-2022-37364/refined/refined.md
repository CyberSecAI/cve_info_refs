Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-37364

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of EMF (Enhanced Metafile) files within PDF-XChange Editor. Specifically, crafted data in an EMF file can cause a write operation to occur beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The application attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user's process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User interaction is required: The target user must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious EMF file in PDF-XChange Editor.
- The attack is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted EMF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or host a malicious EMF file.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to open the malicious EMF file in PDF-XChange Editor or visit a website that triggers the exploit.
