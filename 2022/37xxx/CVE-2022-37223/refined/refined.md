Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the JFinal CMS 5.1.0 application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. This suggests that user-supplied input is being directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
*  Gain unauthorized access to the database.
*  Modify or delete data.
*  Potentially gain complete control of the server depending on the database permissions.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the `/jfinal_cms/system/role/list` route. An attacker can use a tool like sqlmap to inject malicious SQL code through this interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the JFinal CMS application.
* The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable route `/jfinal_cms/system/role/list`.
* The attacker needs to have some familiarity with SQL injection techniques.
