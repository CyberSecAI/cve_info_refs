The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AX1803 (V1.0.0.1) router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `fromSetRouteStatic` function, specifically when handling user-supplied input via the `list` parameter. This function passes the value of `list` to `sub_78440`.
- Inside `sub_78440`, the `_isoc99_sscanf` function is used to parse the input string using a format string of `%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%s`. This format string uses greedy matching, which does not limit the size of data read into the buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow: The `_isoc99_sscanf` function in `sub_78440` does not validate the length of the input before writing it to a stack buffer, leading to a buffer overflow when the input exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Sending a crafted request with an oversized list parameter can cause the device to crash.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By carefully crafting a payload, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges, and achieving a stable root shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint with a specific form parameter `list`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface (e.g., from the same network or via remote access if enabled).
- Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter: The attacker needs to know the path `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` and the vulnerable parameter `list`.
