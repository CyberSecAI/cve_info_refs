Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-37375:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of JPC files in PDF-XChange Editor. Specifically, crafted data in a JPC file can trigger a read operation that goes beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The software reads data beyond the intended memory region, which can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the application's memory.
- Potential for further exploitation: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be used with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- User interaction is required. The target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious JPC file.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious JPC file containing data that will trigger the out-of-bounds read when parsed by PDF-XChange Editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious JPC file to the victim, or trick them into visiting a malicious web page that triggers the exploit.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability (local user is sufficient).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2022-07-26, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2022-08-18.
- PDF-XChange has released an update to address this vulnerability.
