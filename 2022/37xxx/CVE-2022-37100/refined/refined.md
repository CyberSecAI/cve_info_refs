The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C H200[H200-EI] router (H200V100R004 firmware).

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `UpdateMacClone` function where the input parameter `param` is processed using `sscanf` with a `%s` format specifier. This greedy matching behavior allows an attacker to provide input larger than the buffer allocated for `V11` on the stack, leading to a stack overflow.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to unbounded string copy via sscanf. The lack of input validation and size checks on the `param` argument before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the process crashing. The attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a special payload to achieve a stable root shell.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD` parameter set to `UpdateMacClone` and a crafted `param` value that exceeds the buffer size.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the H3C H200 router. The attacker needs to craft a malicious POST request with an oversized value for the `param` parameter.
