  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-37386",
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the resetForm method. By performing actions in JavaScript, an attacker can trigger a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process."

  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause": "A read past the end of an allocated object is triggered within the `resetForm` method.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read",
        "Information Disclosure"
       ],
      "Impact": "Sensitive information disclosure. It can also be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attacker must either convince a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
      "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to perform JavaScript actions to trigger the vulnerability."
