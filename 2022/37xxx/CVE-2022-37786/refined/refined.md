The provided content is related to CVE-2022-37786.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of formula elements within CSV files exported by the wecube-platform application. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or escape special characters, such as "=", "+", "-", "@", which can be interpreted as formulas or commands when opened in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSV Injection (CWE-1236): The application is vulnerable to CSV injection because it allows users to export data containing formula elements without proper sanitization or escaping.
- Lack of input validation/sanitization: The application does not validate or sanitize user-provided data before exporting it to CSV format.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine when the exported CSV file is opened with vulnerable spreadsheet software. In the provided example, the attacker injects `=10+20+cmd|' /C calc'!A0` which triggers the execution of `calc.exe` when the CSV is opened.
- Data exfiltration/manipulation:  More complex payloads could be injected to potentially exfiltrate data from the victimâ€™s machine, or manipulate content on the victim's computer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious CSV export: An attacker can inject malicious formula elements into data that is later exported as a CSV file. This data could be any data that is exported as CSV, including parameters configured in the application.
- User interaction: The victim needs to open the maliciously crafted CSV file with a vulnerable spreadsheet program for the exploit to be successful.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious data into the application. This might require a user account with relevant permissions to create/modify data.
- No additional attacker position or capability is described.
