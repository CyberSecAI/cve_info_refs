Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-37773:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `filter` parameter within the `/statistics/retrieve` page of Maarch RM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `filter` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Database Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to potentially access and disclose all databases, including sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to the `/statistics/retrieve` endpoint.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `filter` parameter is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated with an account that has specific privileges to access the `/statistics` page.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Maarch RM instance.

**Technical Details:**

- A single quote (') in the `filter` parameter value triggers an SQL error, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
- Example of a vulnerable request: `http://{url}/statistics/retreive?operation=deposit&filter=archivalProfile'&startDate=2022-05-04&endDate=2022-07-23&sizeFilter=1`
- The SQL error reveals that the injected value is being directly included in the query.

**Affected Products:**
   - Maarch RM 2.8.X - all versions < 2.8.6
   - Maarch RM 2.9.X - all versions < 2.9.1
