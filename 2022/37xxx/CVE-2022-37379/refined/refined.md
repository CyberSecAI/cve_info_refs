  "cve": "CVE-2022-37379",
  "relevant_content": {
    "summary": "The application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free Information Disclosure or Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash. This occurs due to the access of illegal address as the application fails to update the pointer after the container is expanded during the iteration when handling the AFSpecial_KeystrokeEx method. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of validation of the object's existence before performing operations on it, specifically during the handling of the `AFSpecial_KeystrokeEx` method. The application fails to update the pointer after the container is expanded during the iteration, leading to use-after-free.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-After-Free",
      "Information Disclosure",
       "Memory Corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can potentially disclose sensitive information on affected systems. When combined with other vulnerabilities, it could lead to remote code execution in the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a malicious PDF file that triggers the vulnerable AFSpecial_KeystrokeEx method. The target user needs to interact with the malicious file for the exploit to occur.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker requires no special position or user capabilities, but needs to entice the target to open the specially crafted PDF document. "
