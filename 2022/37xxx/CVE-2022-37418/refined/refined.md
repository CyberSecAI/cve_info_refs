  "CVE-2022-37418": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in automotive remote keyless entry systems known as 'RollBack'.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is a 'resync' behavior implemented in rolling-code chips, where a sequence of valid keyfob codes is accepted to resynchronize the system.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "The primary vulnerability is the acceptance of a sequence of valid keyfob codes as a 'resync' mechanism, which can be exploited to reset the rolling code and gain permanent access to the car."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to unlock a car permanently. This is significantly worse than previous attacks like RollJam, which required re-execution for every access.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Eavesdropping on multiple keyfob presses in a row.",
        "Jamming the transmission between fob and car to capture multiple codes.",
        "Simply recording a series of consecutive key codes."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to eavesdrop and record a sequence of valid keyfob codes. This can be achieved via RF capture, potentially by jamming the signal and forcing the user to press the button multiple times, or simply by capturing valid transmissions. No special expertise is mentioned beyond the ability to record and replay the RF signals."
