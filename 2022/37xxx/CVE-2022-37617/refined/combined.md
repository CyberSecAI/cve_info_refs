| You can definitely overwrite the prototype for `exposeGlobals`:     [browserify-shim/lib/resolve-shims.js](https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim/blob/bae7ece76cf76a5c0382468db324d61c1f533929/lib/resolve-shims.js#L130)  Line 130 in [bae7ece](/thlorenz/browserify-shim/commit/bae7ece76cf76a5c0382468db324d61c1f533929)   |  | exposeGlobals[k] = exp; | | --- | --- |      But I'm not seeing a way that you could pollute the global scope, e.g., `Object.prototype`. Prototype pollution typically involves some form of recursion or at least two levels of property access so that you can write to the objects within a target object. Here there's only one level of property access, `exposeGlobals[k]`.  Beyond that, I'm not even sure overwriting `exposeGlobals` is easily exploitable. Before it's returned, it gets passed to `Object.keys`, which will only return own properties:     [browserify-shim/lib/resolve-shims.js](https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim/blob/bae7ece76cf76a5c0382468db324d61c1f533929/lib/resolve-shims.js#L99-L100)  Lines 99 to 100 in [bae7ece](/thlorenz/browserify-shim/commit/bae7ece76cf76a5c0382468db324d61c1f533929)   |  | function mapifyExposeGlobals(exposeGlobals) { | | --- | --- | |  | return Object.keys(exposeGlobals) |      No methods are called so I'm not seeing a way to achieve code execution.  Would appreciate some clarification on whether there's a substantive vulnerability here or whether this was potentially vulnerable code identified through automated static analysis.  In any case, guarding against prototype assignment is easy enough. |

| Hello,  The code has been flagged as a potentially vulnerable code and the CVE has the sink and the path details of the code.  All the reports are based on the research work of my colleague (you can find her paper's link below) and I am reporting them here as per her analysis and records.  <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3488932.3497769> - This is the published paper with the Github link to her static analysis tool. Thanks |

| This whole package depends on adding a property to the global since that is what certain packages expect. Thus it is only usd in scenarios where other packages *already* overwrite globals the exact same way. Additionally most of the code you keep flagging runs as part of the build step (not when the web app loads in the browser), but I'm not sure that your tools are aware of that.  In more modern scenarios where this is not desired/necessary browserify-shim is not used.  Please stop reporting these issues of the same family here. It is noise and adds overhead to the maintainers work. |
