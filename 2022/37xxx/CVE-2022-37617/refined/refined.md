The provided content relates to CVE-2022-37617.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue within the `resolveShims` function in `resolve-shims.js`. Specifically, the code directly assigns values to properties of the `exposeGlobals` object using a variable `k` derived from user-provided input, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:**  The code directly modifies the properties of the `exposeGlobals` object using a key `k` from user-controlled input (`exposeGlobals[k] = exp`). When `k` is equal to `__proto__` this allows an attacker to modify the prototype of all objects.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not validate the keys used to modify `exposeGlobals`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Although the code does not directly lead to Remote Code Execution(RCE), it is a prototype pollution vulnerability. An attacker could potentially modify the behavior of JavaScript objects. The primary risk is denial of service or unexpected behaviour by overriding methods of objects. 
- While the maintainer believes the impact is low because `Object.keys` only returns own properties, the prototype pollution itself remains a vulnerability

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting specific input (likely within the `shim` config for browserify-shim) an attacker can set the `k` variable to `__proto__` or `constructor`, which allows them to pollute object prototypes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `resolveShims` function, specifically influencing the `k` variable used to set the properties of `exposeGlobals`. This would typically be through manipulating the `shim` configuration within the project that uses `browserify-shim`.
