## Description

**Do you find this plugin helpful? Please consider [leaving a 5-star review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/better-font-awesome).**

Better Font Awesome allows you to automatically integrate the latest available version of [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) into your WordPress project, along with accompanying CSS, shortcodes, and TinyMCE icon shortcode generator.

#### Features

* **Always up-to-date** – automatically fetches the most recent available version of Font Awesome, meaning you no longer need to manually update the version included in your theme/plugin.
* **Backwards compatible** – shortcode output is automatically updated depending on which version of Font Awesome you choose, meaning that you can switch versions without having to modify your shortcodes.
* **Compatible with other plugins** – designed to work with shortcodes generated with plugins like [Font Awesome Icons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome/ "Font Awesome Icons"), [Font Awesome More Icons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-more-icons/ "Font Awesome More Icons"), and [Font Awesome Shortcodes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-shortcodes/), so you can switch to Better Font Awesome and your existing shortcodes will still work.
* **CDN speeds** – Font Awesome CSS is pulled from the super-fast and reliable [jsDelivr CDN](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!fontawesome).
* **Shortcode generator** – includes an easy-to-use TinyMCE dropdown shortcode generator.

#### Settings

All settings can be adjusted via **Settings → Better Font Awesome**.

#### Usage

Better Font Awesome can be used in 3 different ways: shortcode, HTML, and TinyMCE

#### 1. Shortcode

```
[icon name="flag" class="2x spin border" unprefixed_class="my-custom-class"]

```

Note that prefixes (`fa-` and `icon-`) are not required, but if you do include them things will still work just fine! Better Font Awesome is smart enough to know what version of Font Awesome you’re using and correct of the appropriate prefix.

That means that all of the following shortcodes will work, regardless of what version of Font Awesome you choose:

[icon name=”flag” class=”2x spin border”]

[icon name=”icon-flag” class=”icon-2x icon-spin icon-border”]

[icon name=”fa-flag” class=”fa-2x fa-spin fa-border”]

[icon name=”icon-flag” class=”fa-2x spin icon-border”]

You can read more about shortcode usage on [Github](https://github.com/MickeyKay/better-font-awesome-library#shortcode)

#### 2. TinyMCE

Better Font Awesome also provides you with an easy-to-use drop down menu when editing in TinyMCE’s visual mode. Check out our [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-font-awesome/screenshots/ "Screenshots") to see what it looks like.

#### 3. HTML

Note that prefixes are required for HTML usage, and are version-specific. For this reason, shortcode usage is encouraged over HTML. If you do want to use HTML, however, you can read more on the [Font Awesome site](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/).

#### Advanced / Integration

Better Font Awesome is built around the [Better Font Awesome Library](https://github.com/MickeyKay/better-font-awesome-library). This library allows you to integrate Better Font Awesome into any custom project you want to create (perhaps a theme or plugin with a constantly up-to-date icon list), and includes all the [filters](https://github.com/MickeyKay/better-font-awesome-library#filters) you might need.

## Installation

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload Better Font Awesome to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. That’s it! Now you can use 3 different methods (shortcode, HTML, TinyMCE) to insert Font Awesome icons, all outlined in the [Description](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-font-awesome "Description") section.

## FAQ

### How is this plugin different from other Font Awesome plugins?

This plugin is unique in that it automatically pulls in *all* available versions of Font Awesome, meaning you never have to wait for the plugin developer to add the latest version. Furthermore, Better Font Awesome is designed to work with a wide variety of shortcode formats used by other Font Awesome plugins – this means that you can easily switch to Better Font Awesome (if, for example, you need to include icons from the most recent version of Font Awesome, which isn’t always available with other plugins), and they will still work.

### Do I have to install any font files?

Nope. Better Font Awesome automatically pulls in everything you need, and it does it from the lightning-fast jsDelivr CDN.

### What happens if I have another plugin/theme that uses Font Awesome?

Better Font Awesome does it’s best to load after any existing Font Awesome CSS, which can minimize conflicts. If you are experiencing any unexpected behavior resulting from plugin/theme conflicts, you can try checking the box to “Remove existing Font Awesome styles” in under **Settings → Better Font Awesome**.

The filter in TinyMCE editor for Better Font Awesome isn’t working (unresponsive). Will this issue be resolved in any time soon?

1. It is not really compatible with font-awesome official plugin. I have this shortcode [icon name="fort-awesome" prefix="fab"] but not rendered correctly in this plugin.
2. There is only one version available while the screenshot showing version select box which make me understand that there are multiple versions to use. It is okay to use latest but just update screenshot please.
3. FAQ said there is checkbox Remove existing Font Awesome styles but there is not. The only remove I see is Attempt to remove Font Awesome CSS and shortcodes added by other plugins and themes which is very unclear that it will be mess up my post data or not.
4. They use only CDN, no local file option available. If I have to install a site in local network without internet access then this will be dead end. To be fair, this choice is not negative or positive but just my comment.
5. This plugin leave junk in my DB. The option name better-font-awesome\_options still exists after uninstalled. The WordPress document is recommended to clean up the data on uninstall. Read more at Plugin Handbook / Plugin Basics / Uninstall Methods
