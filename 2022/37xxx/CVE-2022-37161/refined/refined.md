Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload arbitrary SVG files within Claroline Connect, an allowed image type, without proper sanitization or input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an SVG file. This SVG file is then stored and executed within the application context when a user views it.
*   **Inadequate File Upload Checks:** The application lacks sufficient checks to validate the content of uploaded SVG files, allowing embedded JavaScript to execute.
* **Unsanitized User Input:** The application does not sanitize the SVG file before displaying it, leading to execution of any malicious code contained within.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when they interact with the uploaded SVG file. This could lead to a number of consequences:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or stored in the browser.
    *   **Page Defacement:** Modifying the content of the application interface.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Attempting to download or execute malware on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SVG File Upload:** The attacker uploads a crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript through an allowed upload form, such as a resource icon upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker likely needs to be an authenticated user of the Claroline Connect platform with the ability to upload files.
*   **Knowledge of SVG Structure and XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to create an SVG file containing valid JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes screenshots ("xss\_poc" and "xss\_new\_poc") demonstrating the successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability.
*   The suggested fix is to disallow SVG file uploads and enhance file upload checks to validate for any malicious content.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited through several upload forms available in the application.
