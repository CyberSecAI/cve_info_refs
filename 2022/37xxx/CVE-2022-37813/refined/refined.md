The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC1206 router firmware (V15.03.06.23).

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is located in the `fromSetSysTime` function. The `sscanf` function is used to parse a time string from user input, using a greedy matching pattern (`%[^-]-%[^-]-%[^ ] %[^:]:%[^:]:%s`). This allows an attacker to provide an overly long input string, which exceeds the buffer size of variables intended to store year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow vulnerability due to insecure use of `sscanf` with a greedy matching format specifier in a function handling user input.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): The provided POC can crash the device, causing a denial-of-service.
    - Arbitrary code execution: By carefully crafting the payload, the attacker can hijack the Program Counter (PC) register and eventually achieve a stable root shell.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack is performed via an HTTP POST request to `/goform/SetSysTimeCfg`.
    - The vulnerable input is in the `time` parameter of the POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface.
    - The attacker is likely to be on the same local network as the router.
