In line 1018, the program continuously reads `marker` in the stream by calling `IOStream::PeekWord()` function.   [libjpeg/marker/frame.cpp](https://github.com/thorfdbg/libjpeg/blob/842c7baef7808f12cad19b49b2efcfa9575dbc78/marker/frame.cpp#L1018)  Line 1018 in [842c7ba](/thorfdbg/libjpeg/commit/842c7baef7808f12cad19b49b2efcfa9575dbc78)   |  | LONG marker = io->PeekWord(); | | --- | --- |      In cases of the `default` branch, the loop won't exit.   [libjpeg/marker/frame.cpp](https://github.com/thorfdbg/libjpeg/blob/842c7baef7808f12cad19b49b2efcfa9575dbc78/marker/frame.cpp#L1088-L1117)  Lines 1088 to 1117 in [842c7ba](/thorfdbg/libjpeg/commit/842c7baef7808f12cad19b49b2efcfa9575dbc78)   |  | if (marker < 0xff00) { | | --- | --- | |  | JPG\_WARN(MALFORMED\_STREAM,"Frame::ParseTrailer", | |  | "expecting a marker or marker segment - stream is out of sync"); | |  | // Advance to the next marker and see how it goes from there... | |  | io->Get(); // Remove the invalid thing. | |  | do { | |  | marker = io->Get(); | |  | } while(marker != 0xff && marker != ByteStream::EOF); | |  | // | |  | if (marker == ByteStream::EOF) { | |  | JPG\_WARN(UNEXPECTED\_EOF,"Frame::ParseTrailer", | |  | "run into an EOF while scanning for the next marker"); | |  | return false; | |  | } | |  | io->LastUnDo(); | |  | // Continue parsing, check what the next marker might be. | |  | } else { | |  | // Something that looks like a valid marker. This could be the | |  | // tables/misc section of the next frame or next scan, depending | |  | // on whether we are hierarchical (next frame) or progressive (next scan). | |  | // Unfortunately, what is what we only know after having received either | |  | // the SOS marker (next scan) or an SOF marker (next frame). | |  | // Thus, at this time, parse of the tables, place its data in the | |  | // global table namespace, overriding what was there, then | |  | // continue parsing here until we know what we have. | |  | assert(m\_pTables); | |  | // This might include EXP if we are hierarchical. | |  | m\_pTables->ParseTables(io,NULL,m\_pParent->isHierarchical(),(m\_Type == JPEG\_LS)?true:false); | |  | } | |  | } |      The problem is that the `IOStream::PeekWord()` function might always return a same value.  Specifically, the `IOStream::PeekWord()` calls `ByteStream::Get()`.   [libjpeg/io/bytestream.cpp](https://github.com/thorfdbg/libjpeg/blob/91985dc031428f8a7cf90af5e22e234f1f529611/io/bytestream.cpp#L214-L224)  Lines 214 to 224 in [91985dc](/thorfdbg/libjpeg/commit/91985dc031428f8a7cf90af5e22e234f1f529611)   |  | LONG ByteStream::Get(void) // read a single byte (not inlined) | | --- | --- | |  | { | |  |  | |  | if (m\_pucBufPtr >= m\_pucBufEnd) { | |  | if (Fill() == 0) // Found EOF | |  | return EOF; | |  | } | |  | assert(m\_pucBufPtr < m\_pucBufEnd); | |  |  | |  | return \*m\_pucBufPtr++; | |  | } |      `IOStream::PeekWord()` returns at line 223 with `m_pucBufPtr++`. However, when using gdb to check the value of `m_pucBufPtr`, I found that the ByteStream::Get() functions repeatedly read the values from the same address. The 0x790f2a and 0x790f29 correspond to `byte1` and `byte2` in `IOStream::PeekWord()` and they never change.  [Screen Shot 2022-07-26 at 23 54 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70422882/181052728-ee1cbd37-184d-4c75-9dce-6c7cbca25092.png)  `IOStream::PeekWord()` then always returns a same value (calculated by `byte1` and `byte2`). Finally, the program never terminates because the return value forces the program to take the `default` branch. |
