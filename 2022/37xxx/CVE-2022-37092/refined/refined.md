- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `SetAPWifiorLedInfoById` function uses `sscanf` with a greedy matching specifier `%[^;]` to parse input, which is not bounded by the size of the buffer `V12`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to unbounded string copy using `sscanf` with `%[^;]`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the device process.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution leading to a stable root shell.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD=SetAPWifiorLedInfoById` parameter and a long string within the `param` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, and must know the correct path and parameters to call the vulnerable function (`/goform/aspForm` with `CMD=SetAPWifiorLedInfoById`).
