The provided content contains information about a stack overflow vulnerability in H3C H200[H200-EI] (H200V100R004) devices.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `EditMacList` function.
- The function uses `sscanf` with the format specifier `%[^;];` to parse input, which is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
- The greedy matching mechanism of `%[^;]` allows the input to exceed the buffer size allocated for `V19`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow in the `EditMacList` function due to unchecked input size when using `sscanf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve a stable root shell by exploiting the stack overflow, allowing for complete control of the device.
- A denial-of-service (DoS) can also be achieved by carefully crafted input data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to `/goform/aspForm` with the `CMD=EditMacList` parameter.
- The `param` value in the request contains a string of 'A' characters followed by a semicolon, designed to overflow the buffer in the `EditMacList` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device, indicating network access is required.
- The attacker needs to know the target's IP address and the path of the vulnerable form.
