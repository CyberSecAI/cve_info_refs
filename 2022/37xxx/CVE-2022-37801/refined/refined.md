Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a stack overflow vulnerability within the `setQosMiblist` function of Tenda AC1206 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `sscanf` function is used with greedy matching (`%[^;]`) to parse input data into buffers on the stack without proper bounds checking.
- **Unsafe String Parsing:** The format string `";%[^;];%[^;];%[^;];%[^;];"` is used to split the input data into several parts. If the input data is larger than expected, it overflows the stack-based buffers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted payload, an attacker can crash the device, causing a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can potentially overwrite the return address of the function and gain control of the execution flow leading to Remote Code Execution and obtaining a root shell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted `POST` request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint.
- **Specific Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is named `list`, which is used as input to the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, typically over a local network (or potentially remotely if the device's web interface is exposed).
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint (`/goform/SetNetControlList`) and the name of the vulnerable parameter (`list`).

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function `setQosMiblist` parses the provided `list` parameter with a format string: `";%[^;];%[^;];%[^;];%[^;];"`. The tokens are expected to be split by `;` characters and written to the stack. However, the `%[^;]` specifier reads all characters up to the next semicolon, without regard for the buffer sizes of the stack allocated variables (`limit_en`, `mac`, `tmp_urate`, and `tmp_drate`). If the provided string within any of the `;` delimiters is longer than the size of stack allocated variables, it will cause a buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided POC demonstrates a DoS attack, but the description indicates that an attacker can gain a "stable root shell" with a more sophisticated exploit.
- The specific firmware version affected is Tenda AC1206 (V15.03.06.23).
- The content includes an HTTP request demonstrating the exploit in the `list` parameter.
