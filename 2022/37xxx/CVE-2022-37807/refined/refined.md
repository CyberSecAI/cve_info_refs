The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC1206 router firmware (V15.03.06.23).

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `formSetClientState` function. Specifically, the use of `sprintf` to format the `limitEn`, `deviceId`, `limitSpeedUp`, and `limitSpeed` parameters into a buffer (`buff`) using the format string `%d;%s;%s;%s` without proper bounds checking.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A classic stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `sprintf` with unchecked input sizes. The `sprintf` function will continue writing past the end of the allocated `buff` if the input strings are too large.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve a denial-of-service (DOS) by causing the device to crash. The attacker can also hijack program control by overwriting the return address on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution. This ultimately allows the attacker to gain a stable root shell on the device.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetClientState` endpoint. The attacker crafts a malicious payload in the `limitSpeed` parameter which, when combined with other parameters during `sprintf`, triggers the overflow.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, typically requiring network connectivity to the router (e.g., being on the same network or having the router's web interface exposed to the internet).
