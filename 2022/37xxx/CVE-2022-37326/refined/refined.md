      "Description": "Docker Desktop for Windows is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion, which can lead to local privilege escalation. A low-privileged user can start and stop Docker services through a specific API, which can cause the deletion of any arbitrary file by specifying a specific file path. This can be abused by a low-privileged user using a crafted malicious program to achieve privilege escalation."
