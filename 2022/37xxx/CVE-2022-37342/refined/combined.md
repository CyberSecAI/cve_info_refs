I find this very useful but now have to look for an alternative if I cant troubleshoot it because it stopped working after a recent upgrade 24/04/2020.

Great for customizing and tinkering with your WP installation on the fly, without hardcoding any changes in the theme, etc.

I have been using this plugin and it has been working great so far.
Helped me add a necessary code tweak and maintain it even with my limited php knowledge.
Thanks to the developers for making this available and keeping it up to date!

But when I do, it’s because it deserves 5-stars.
Hat’s off to the gentleman that originally wrote this plugin and had so many ignorant people discourage his continuation of supporting it… GLASS UP to the gentleman that took it over and made it even better. I love this so much. Nothing like a quick dirty way to write your own micro-plugins for, like… anything. It’s really great. Thanks.
