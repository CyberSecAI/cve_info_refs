It mentions an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability related to handling of certain XFA documents. It also notes that this occurs when the application loads images from all resources (including untrusted ones) when parsing image resources, or fails to request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers."

It specifies that the vulnerability exists due to the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. This aligns with the root cause specified by the Foxit advisory"
