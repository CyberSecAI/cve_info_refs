Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2022-37310:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the metrics and help modules within the OX App Suite handle parts of the URL to determine capabilities. The mechanism is flawed, allowing attackers to use special characters to register malicious capabilities. These malicious capabilities are then executed as script code after a user logs in.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80) due to insufficient sanitization of input used to determine user capabilities
- Improper handling of URL parameters, allowing injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary script code within the victim's browser context.
- Potential for session hijacking.
- Triggering unwanted actions through the web interface (e.g., redirecting to a third-party site).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing special characters within the "cap" parameter.
- The victim is tricked into following this crafted URL to their OX App Suite instance.
- Upon logging in, the injected script executes within the victim's session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and distribute a malicious URL.
- No prior authentication is needed.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to click on the malicious link and log in.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the "metrics" and "help" modules of OX App Suite.
- While the "metrics" module is optional, the "help" module is present in all instances.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) URL demonstrates the injection of JavaScript code via URL manipulation.
- The vulnerability was addressed by sanitizing non-parsable characters from the capabilities input.
