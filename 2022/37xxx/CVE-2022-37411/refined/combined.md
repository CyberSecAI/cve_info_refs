A PHP session was created by a session\_start() function call. This interferes with REST API and loopback requests. The session should be closed by session\_write\_close() before making any HTTP requests.
on the file wpcaptcha.php you should fix line 40 to 44 with this
if ( !session\_id() )
{ session\_start( [ ‚Äòread\_and\_close‚Äô => true, ] ); }
I had to find it my way out
