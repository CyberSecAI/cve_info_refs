  "CVE-2022-37705": {
    "description": "A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and value are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals sign is also supported),",
    "root_cause": "The `runtar` SUID binary incorrectly handles arguments passed to the `tar` command. It assumes arguments are separated by a space (`--foo bar`), but also accepts the equals sign notation (`--foo=bar`). This improper argument parsing allows attackers to inject malicious options to `tar`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Local privilege escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local low-privileged user can gain root privileges by exploiting the vulnerability. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious arguments to the `runtar` binary.",
    "required_capabilities": "A local user with the ability to execute the `runtar` binary."
