**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection in the JetNexus/EdgeNexus management portal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to perform actions on the web application as an authenticated user, including privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution by chaining it with CVE-2022-37718.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can craft a malicious link or HTML page containing a CSRF payload. When a logged-in user clicks the link or visits the page, it will trigger an HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
