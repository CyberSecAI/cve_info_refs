Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the "RollBack" attack against automotive remote keyless entry systems:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a "resync" behavior implemented in many rolling-code systems. These systems accept a sequence of valid key codes (typically 2-5) to resynchronize the keyfob and the car, in case they get out of sync. This "feature," intended for convenience, allows an attacker to permanently compromise the car's security.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Resynchronization Vulnerability:**  The core weakness lies in the predictable way that the resync mechanism operates. By capturing a short sequence of valid keyfob codes, an attacker can reset the rolling code sequence to a known state, gaining permanent access.
- **Lack of Time Sensitivity:** The attack is time-agnostic, meaning the captured keycodes do not need to be replayed immediately. The attacker can use them at their convenience, unlike a traditional replay attack where the time window for replay is narrow.
- **Widespread Implementation:** The "resync" behavior appears to be documented in the datasheets for common rolling code chips, suggesting a wide prevalence of this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Permanent Unlocking:** Exploiting this vulnerability enables an attacker to unlock the targeted vehicle repeatedly, without needing to reacquire key codes.
- **Vehicle Theft:** Once unlocked, the vehicle is highly vulnerable to theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Eavesdropping:** The attacker must eavesdrop on a sequence of valid keyfob presses. This can be done either by:
  - Jamming the signal between the keyfob and car to force the owner to press the button multiple times.
  - Simply recording a sequence of keyfob presses.
- **Replay:** The attacker then uses the captured keycodes to resynchronize the car's rolling code system, effectively opening the car.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within range to capture the radio signals emitted by the keyfob.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Basic understanding of radio signal capture and replay is required.
- **Equipment:** The attacker needs an SDR (software-defined radio) or equivalent to capture and replay RF signals.

**Additional Details:**

- The attack is named "RollBack" due to its ability to "roll back" the car's security.
- It is significantly worse than previous attacks like RollJam because it compromises the car permanently.
-  The attack highlights a critical failure to consider security implications of "convenience" features during the design of these systems.
- Mitigation of this vulnerability is expected to be complex and difficult, requiring redesign and replacements of existing systems.
