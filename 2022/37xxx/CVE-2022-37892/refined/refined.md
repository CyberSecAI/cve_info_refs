- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in a victim's browser within the context of the affected interface. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject malicious script code through the web management interface. When a user of the interface accesses the page containing the malicious script, it gets executed in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script code into the web management interface, and the user needs to access the affected interface. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
