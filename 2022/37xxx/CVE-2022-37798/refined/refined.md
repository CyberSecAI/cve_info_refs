Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `save_virtualser_data` function of the Tenda AC1206 router firmware (V15.03.06.23). This function uses `sscanf` with a format string `%[^,]%*c%[^,]%*c%[^,]%*c%s` to parse user-supplied input. The use of the `%[^,]` specifier is a greedy matching mechanism, which will read up to the next comma. When the input size exceeds the size of the buffers `lan_ip`, `in_port`, `out_port`, or `protocol`, a stack buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The primary weakness is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `save_virtualser_data` function due to the unsafe usage of `sscanf` and a greedy matching specifier.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate the length of input data before writing into the buffers on the stack, making it susceptible to overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** A simple crafted payload, like the one provided in the POC, can cause the device to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the payload, it is possible to overwrite the return address on the stack and hijack control flow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to obtain a stable root shell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` endpoint.
- **`list` Parameter:** The vulnerable data is passed through the `list` parameter in the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, implying network connectivity to the device.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint and Parameter:** The attacker must know about the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` and the vulnerable `list` parameter.
- **Crafting Exploit Payload:**  To achieve arbitrary code execution, the attacker needs to craft a payload that will overwrite the return address and inject their malicious code.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided POC demonstrates the ability to cause a crash and hijack the PC register, indicating the exploitability of the stack overflow.
- The document mentions that a stable root shell can be obtained, indicating the severity of the vulnerability.
- The content also includes the manufacturer's website, firmware download link, and images of the vulnerable code and exploit process.
