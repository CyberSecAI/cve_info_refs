Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `cuppa/api/index.php` file within the CuppaCMS application. The application processes the `function` parameter from a POST request in a way that allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided in the `function` parameter, allowing an attacker to include files from the local filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read sensitive files on the server. This could include configuration files containing database credentials, application source code, or any other file the web server has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to `cuppa/api/index.php`.
- The `function` parameter within the POST request is the entry point for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the Cuppa CMS application.
- The attacker needs a valid API key.
- The attacker must be able to send a POST request to `cuppa/api/index.php` with a crafted `function` parameter.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) images and exploit code indicate that the attacker can read arbitrary files from the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content links to a GitHub repository `badru8612/CuppaCMS-Authenticated-LFI-Vulnerability`, which contains additional details including screenshots of the exploit and Python exploit code (`exploit.py`).
- This issue was reported in GitHub issue #20 of the CuppaCMS project (`CuppaCMS/CuppaCMS#20`).
- The vulnerability requires authentication to exploit.
