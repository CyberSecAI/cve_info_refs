Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-37145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The PlexTrac application did not properly restrict excessive authentication attempts. This means there was no rate-limiting or account lockout mechanism in place.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The application allowed an unlimited number of login attempts for a single account.
- **No Account Lockout:** There was no mechanism to lock out an account after a certain number of failed login attempts.
- **Efficient Authentication Handling:** The application was written to handle authentication efficiently, enabling attackers to send a large number of requests per minute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers could use automated tools to attempt numerous password combinations until they find the correct one. The lack of rate limiting and account lockout makes this feasible.
- **Compromised Accounts:** Successful brute-force attacks could lead to unauthorized access to PlexTrac accounts.
- **Access to Sensitive Data:** Once an attacker gains access, they can view and steal sensitive information stored within PlexTrac.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Authentication Requests:** An attacker would send login requests to the application's authentication endpoint using different password combinations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the PlexTrac application.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of how to make authentication requests.
- **Automated Tooling:** Attackers would likely utilize automated tools to conduct brute-force attacks.

**Additional Information**

- The vulnerability was fixed in PlexTrac version 1.17.0 by implementing an account lockout after 5 consecutive authentication failures.
- This vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities like username enumeration (CVE-2022-37146) and MFA bruteforce (CVE-2022-37144) to fully compromise a PlexTrac instance.
