How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

### [Great recipe plugin, works for me on 5.21](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-recipe-plugin-works-for-me-on-5-21/)

[VinceGledhill](https://profiles.wordpress.org/vincegledhill/ "Posts by VinceGledhill")

I have tried lots of recipe plugins, but this one beats them all. It’s a great interface for writing out your recipe and looks great on the page.
I particularly like the video and images section so you can add both to a recipe.
Please can you add options for users to select their ingredients in metric or imperial. I.E. 1 tsp = 5ml, 1oz = 28g etc. I am happy to provide a table so that the “site owner” can choose to write a recipe in one format, and the user can select the format that they want the recipe to be shown in.
