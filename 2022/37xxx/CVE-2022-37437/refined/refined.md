- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When using Ingest Actions in Splunk Web to configure a destination on Amazon S3, TLS certificate validation is not correctly performed or tested.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper TLS certificate validation for Ingest Actions destinations configured through Splunk Web. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to the absence of TLS certificate validation for destinations created via the Ingest Actions UI in Splunk Web.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting the communication between Splunk Enterprise and the S3 destination. This could allow the attacker to gain access to data in transit or to modify the data being sent.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, specifically man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept communication between the Splunk Enterprise instance and the target S3 destination.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned on the network to intercept traffic between Splunk Enterprise and the S3 destination. The attacker does not need any special access to the Splunk Enterprise system itself. The attacker needs the ability to impersonate the S3 server through a manipulated certificate.

The vulnerability is specific to Splunk Enterprise version 9.0.0 and does not affect prior versions. It only applies to Ingest Actions destinations configured through Splunk Web, and only when TLS certificate validation has been configured in the Splunk environment.
