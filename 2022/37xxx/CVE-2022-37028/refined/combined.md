## Find your solution by school type

iSAMS helps 1,600+ schools manage every area of school life, wherever they are, with an integrated system. Let us help you find the right solution.

Independent Schools

![Arrow](https://www.isams.com/wp-content/themes/isams-theme/assets/img/icon/arrow-white-down.svg)

> "I identified iSAMS very early on as a leading contender to replace our MIS, as it was always well spoken of in various groups and forums. At the heart of our requirements was a responsive and reliable system, that’s accessible anywhere and open to integrations."
> Forest School, United Kingdom

[Find out more](https://www.isams.com/solutions/school-type/school-management-information-system-for-independent-schools/)

### Independent Schools

We understand that every Independent School needs an MIS that makes life easier for staff, so you can deliver an outstanding education to your students.

iSAMS achieves this by delivering an intuitive and easy-to-use MIS that can be accessed from anywhere, with multiple third-party integrations to allow you to build a system that works for your school.

We remove the stress that comes with systems that don’t work, by delivering something that does.

International Schools

> “I would say buy iSAMS. I would recommend it highly for Independent and International Schools. I can’t think of an MIS system that would do a better job.”
> New English School, Kuwait

[Find out more](https://www.isams.com/solutions/school-type/school-management-system-international-schools)

### International Schools

We believe an effective MIS can play a key role in the success of an International School.

iSAMS provides a modular, multi-lingual system that grows as your school evolves, allowing you to build a system for your exact needs: from foreign student enrolment to end-of-year exams, timetabling, HR, academic reporting, student wellbeing and financial reporting.

Our fully integrated finance solution with multi-currency support removes the pain of international audits.

Virtual Schools

![Arrow](https://www.isams.com/wp-content/themes/isams-theme/assets/img/icon/arrow-white-down.svg)

> “iSAMS being web-based is a big bonus, so we can log into it wherever and whenever we need to. Being able to use iSAMS remotely is still something many of our staff members often take advantage of.”
> Strathallan School, United Kingdom

[Find out more](https://www.isams.com/solutions/school-type/school-management-system-virtual-schools/)

### Virtual Schools

We understand that for Virtual Schools to deliver an excellent education, they need a digital infrastructure to match.

iSAMS is a 100% web-based MIS that can be accessed from anywhere, with multiple third-party integrations to online learning platforms such as MS Teams and Google Classroom.

Our suite of portals and mobile apps enable you to communicate effectively throughout the school community.

Groups of Schools

![Arrow](https://www.isams.com/wp-content/themes/isams-theme/assets/img/icon/arrow-white-down.svg)

> "The systems we evaluated which were genuinely web-based, seemed to be created for small enterprises. We wanted a system which could be adapted to our international group needs.”
> Bellevue Education Group, Worldwide

[Find out more](https://www.isams.com/solutions/school-type/group-schools/)

### Groups of Schools

We exist to streamline the operations of schools, simplifying processes and eliminating double working.

iSAMS enables school groups to manage all academic, wellbeing, admissions, administrative and financial information within a centralised location using a single MIS solution offering one interface in a single database. iSAMS is simple to implement across multiple locations and can grow alongside your schools.

Our integrated finance solution removes the pain of group reporting.
