BE A PART OF SOMETHING NEW
![](//orchardproject.com/wp-content/plugins/revslider/public/assets/assets/dummy.png)

#### Performance. TV. Audio.

#### We make and support great new work. Pure and simple.

For seventeen years, the Orchard Project has been a preeminent engine of new work in the dramatic arts world, helping over 1500 artists and 400 shows develop and go on to stages as big as Broadway and as small as a basement in Sweden. In 2018, our support expanded to TV, and in 2020, to audio storytelling.

Our shows have garnered acclaim, from TONY and Obie awards to life in television and the big screen. The artists in our extended community are pushing the field of performance forward each and every day. Through residencies, developmental productions and other support activities, we take risks where no one else is willing to.
