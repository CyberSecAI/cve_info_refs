### **[50u1w4y](/50u1w4y)** commented [Jul 29, 2022](#issue-1321677568)

| 现象描述 After cmake(Debug version) and run with `./MediaServer`(maybe add sudo to support port below 1024), a client can send RTMP requests to make the server crash. 如何复现?  1. git clone from github with `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ZLMediaKit/ZLMediaKit.git` and `git submodule update --init` and cmake it. 2. just run server using command `[sudo] ./MediaServer` with default config.ini 3. using ffmpeg to push flow or not (say crash in both situation) 4. run [sender.py with poc](https://github.com/ZLMediaKit/ZLMediaKit/files/9215475/poc.zip)  相关日志或截图 展开查看详细日志 ```  when not push flow:  [notpushflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53857494/181666003-d886bccf-52fc-45b6-9dd4-4bee7e570c7d.png)  when push flow:  [pushflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53857494/181665902-0fb6abe6-cc8e-44db-a37c-a236f1ec853b.png)  ``` 配置 展开查看详细配置 ``` default config(after cmake and changed nothing)  ``` 各种环境信息  * **git commit hash: [d0f0c69](https://github.com/ZLMediaKit/ZLMediaKit/commit/d0f0c69f931566e5fa5765fc75fc8c6d9480286c)** * **操作系统及版本: Ubuntu 20.04** * **硬件信息: Intel** * **其他需要补充的信息** |

| Is this right ?  ``` $ python ./sender.py 127.0.0.1 1935 ./poc sendbuf len is 3664 going to send 1537 bytes data Traceback (most recent call last):   File "./sender.py", line 40, in <module>     while len(n) > 0: NameError: name 'n' is not defined ``` |

| Of course not right. It seems that the first time receive timeout.  Yes, in gdb the server will receive something like `Thread 4 "event poller 0" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.` |

| can't you reproduce that?  You can try run again, this error is because the receive timeout, maybe the network stucks.  The client is just sent the handshake packet(C0+C1), the server should return S0+S1+S2 now, but receive timeout. |
