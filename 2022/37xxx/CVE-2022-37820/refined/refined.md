Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `formSetSysToolDDNS` function of the Tenda AX1803 router firmware. The function copies the value of the `ddnsEn` parameter received from a POST request into a fixed-size buffer (`v15`) using `strcpy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used without any bounds checking, allowing an attacker to write data beyond the allocated buffer size for `v15` on the stack.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `ddnsEn` parameter is not validated or sanitized before being copied into the buffer.
*   **Use of `strcpy`:** The usage of the `strcpy` function is inherently unsafe due to its lack of bounds checking and its susceptibility to buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates that sending an oversized `ddnsEn` parameter can cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow payload, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, gaining the ability to control the program's execution flow and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Root Shell Access:** The attacker can obtain a stable root shell on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specifically crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` endpoint.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface. This could be from the LAN or WAN if the web interface is exposed to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the affected endpoint and parameter to exploit the stack overflow.
*   **Crafting Payload (for full exploitation):** The attacker would need to craft a malicious payload designed to overwrite the return address on the stack and potentially other parts of the stack to execute arbitrary code.
