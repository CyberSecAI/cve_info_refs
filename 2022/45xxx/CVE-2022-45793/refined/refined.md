Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-45793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **Improper Authorization (CWE-285)**. Specifically, the Omron Sysmac Studio engineering software installs executables with low-privileged user "write" permissions. This allows a lower privileged user to replace an executable file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:**  The software fails to properly restrict write access to critical executable files.
*   **Low-Privileged User Writable Files:** Executables within the software installation directory are writable by users with low privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can replace legitimate executables with malicious ones, leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running the software. This could result in a compromise of the system on which the software is installed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed. The attacker needs to have the ability to write to the directory where the vulnerable software is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system.
*   **Low Privileges:**  The attacker needs to have write permissions to the installation directory of the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Omron Sysmac Studio versions 1.54 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.5.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Reid Wightman of Dragos.
*   The vendor, Omron, released a countermeasure version of the software (version 1.55).
*   Mitigation includes standard security practices:
    *   Anti-virus protection
    *   Restricting network access
    *   Firewalls
    *   VPNs
    *   Strong Passwords and multi-factor authentication.
