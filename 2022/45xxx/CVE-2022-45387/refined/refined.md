Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45387:

**CVE-2022-45387:**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** BART Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.3 and earlier
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The BART Plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the parsed content of build logs before displaying them on the Jenkins UI.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the build logs. When a user views the build logs, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing of sensitive information (cookies, tokens)
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with `Item/Configure` permission can inject malicious code via build logs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have `Item/Configure` permission on a Jenkins project. This allows them to modify the build configuration.
    *   The attacker can then introduce malicious content into the build logs, for example by inserting a malicious HTML tag in a script that is part of the build process.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to view the build logs. Any user that has permission to view the build logs for that project is affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that there is **no fix available** for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
* The provided content provides more detail than the official CVE description, outlining the specific mechanism (lack of escaping in build log rendering) for this XSS vulnerability.
