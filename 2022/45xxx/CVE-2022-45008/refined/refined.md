The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Online Leave Management System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new department. Specifically, the `name` field in the department creation form allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed when other users view the department list.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user input before storing it in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other users who access the vulnerable page.
- **Session hijacking:** As demonstrated by the provided payload `alert(document.cookie)`, attackers can steal user session cookies.
- **Account compromise:** Through session hijacking or other malicious scripts, attackers may compromise user accounts.
- **Data theft/manipulation:** Attackers could use JavaScript to extract sensitive data or alter the content of the vulnerable web page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the "Create New" button on the Department List page `/leave_system/admin/?page=maintenance/department`.
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `name` field of the department creation form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the admin interface of the leave management system.
- The attacker requires the ability to create new departments.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be an administrator, based on the description, but does require some level of access to the department maintenance function.
