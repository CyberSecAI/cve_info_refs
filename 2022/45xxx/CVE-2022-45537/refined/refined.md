**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to control the value of the `ENV_LIST_URL` cookie.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in EyouCMS version 1.6.0-UTF8-SP1 and possibly earlier versions.
- The malicious payload is injected via the `ENV_LIST_URL` cookie.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a POST request to the article add function to trigger the vulnerability
- The payload used in the PoC is:
    ```
    %2Feyoucms%2Flogin.php%3Fm%3Dadmin%26c%3DArchives%26a%3Dindex_archives%26lang%3Dcn"/><script>alert(1)</script><a
    ```
