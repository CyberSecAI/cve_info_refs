- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This allows an attacker to force a higher privileged user to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will perform unwanted actions within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into initiating a crafted request. This typically involves social engineering. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.
