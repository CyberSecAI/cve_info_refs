## Password exposure in H2 Database

High severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj/dependabot)

## Package

maven

com.h2database:h2
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 1.4.198, < 2.2.220

## Patched versions

2.2.220

## Description

The web-based admin console in H2 Database Engine through 2.1.214 can be started via the CLI with the argument -webAdminPassword, which allows the user to specify the password in cleartext for the web admin console. Consequently, a local user (or an attacker that has obtained local access through some means) would be able to discover the password by listing processes and their arguments. NOTE: the vendor states "This is not a vulnerability of H2 Console ... Passwords should never be passed on the command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to know that."

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

| Dependabot and `org.owasp:dependency-check-maven` have been reporting [CVE-2022-45868](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj "CVE-2022-45868") (see [GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj "GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj")) to me. I didn't find this CVE referenced from any issue in the issue tracker here, so I'm creating this one.  Since the CVE has already been published (possibly as a zero day??), I suspect it's OK to report this publicly here. For future private reports, I think it would be useful to set up a security policy here on github? <https://github.com/h2database/h2database/security/policy> |

| Well, it seems your explanation was not honoured by the researchers, given that [GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj "GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj") is now reported by all sorts of automation tools...  I'm not sure what to do about this. You can obviously close this issue here, but many others will get similar reports from dependabot and the owasp checker. |

| Documentation of H2 describes only a file-based configuration (and password actually can be encrypted in configuration file).  But it is possible to pass password to a server inside an application without that file:  ``` Server server = new Server(); server.runTool("-web", "-webPort", "8182", "-properties", "null", "-webAdminPassword", "123"); ```  Somebody abused this way by passing these arguments in the command like. OK, this way will also work and actually it is possible to pass passwords in the command line to many other applications too, but why it is considered as a vulnerability of such applications, especially when command line isn't suggested anywhere and there are safer documented ways?  I don't know that to do with this fake report. This setting is rarely needed, but why we should remove it? I also don't see a simple reliable way to check source of password to reject only passwords from a command line. |

### @katzyn **[katzyn](/katzyn)** commented [Jul 3, 2023](#issue-1785297582)

`webAdminPassword` setting allowed both clear-text passwords and hashes of salted passwords from the beginning, but there were no documented methods for generation of such hashes. It was possible to write a clear-text password to configuration file and then save settings of H2 Console from H2 Console itself to get a configuration file with hashed password, but this way wasn't documented either.

1. A new public method is added and documented for this purpose. This method requires at least 12 characters for more safety.
2. Clear-text passwords from all sources are not accepted any more. Old installations with password hashes in configuration files will continue to work after this change.
3. `runTool()` method still allows this parameter to be passed (now only with salted hash), but `main()` method rejects this parameter to make these strange people happy.

(This setting is probably needed for less than 1% of users, why so many people think that it is something important?)

Please note that opting out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Services or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from other companies that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.

### How We Secure the Information We Collect From or About You

The security of your personal information is very important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using reasonable security measures during transmission and upon receipt. We always use a combination of physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the information we collect through the Services. While we use these precautions to safeguard your information, we cannot guarantee the security of the networks, systems, servers, devices, and databases we operate or that are operated on our behalf. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at at security@sonatype.com.

## **How We Share Your Information**

* Service Providers and Contractors: We engage vendors to perform certain functions on our behalf such as: billing and collection providers; auditing and accounting firms; professional services consultants; providers of analytics services; security vendors; employment recruiters, and IT vendors.
* Social Media Platforms: Where you choose to interact with us through social media, your interaction with these programs typically allows the social media company to collect some information about you through digital cookies and other tracking mechanisms that they place on your device. In some cases, the social media company may recognize you through its digital cookies even when you do not interact with their application. Please visit the social media companies’ respective privacy policies to better understand their data collection practices and the controls they make available to you.
* Companies involved in advertising: We partner with companies that assist us in advertising about our Services to others who may be interested in the Services.

## **Cross-border Transfer of Data**

If you use our Services outside of the United States, you understand that we may collect, process, and store your information in the U.S. and other countries.

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “Personal Information,” as well as rights to know/access, delete, correct, and limit sale and sharing of Personal Information.  You also have the right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights.

## **Information for Individuals Located in the UK, EEA, and Switzerland**

We process “Personal Data,” as that term is defined in the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation, on the following legal bases: (1) with your consent; (2) as necessary to perform our agreement to provide Services; and (3) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing the Services where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedom related to data privacy. Information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the U.S. or any other country in which we or our subcontractors, Corporate Affiliates, Service Providers, and third-party partners maintain facilities, as described above.

We only retain and use your Personal Data for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you the Services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your Personal Data to provide Services to you, contact us at privacy@sonatype.com.

To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process the information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. If you want to learn more about our specific retention periods for your Personal Data, you may contact us at privacy@sonatype.com.

Upon expiry of the applicable retention period, we securely destroy your Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

Individuals located in the United Kingdom (“UK”), European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland have the right to lodge a complaint about our data collection and processing actions with the supervisory authority concerned. Contact details for data protection authorities are available [here.](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080/en)

If you are a resident of the UK, EEA, or Switzerland, you are entitled to certain rights. Please note: in order to verify your identity, we may require you to provide us with information prior to accessing any records containing information about you. These rights include the ability:

* to request from us access to information held about you.

* to ask for the information we hold about you to be rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.

* to ask for data to be erased if the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, you withdraw consent and no other legal basis for processing exists, or you believe your fundamental rights to data privacy and protection outweigh our legitimate interest in continuing the processing.

* to request that we restrict our processing if we are processing your data based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest as an exercise of official authority (including profiling); using your data for direct marketing (including profiling); or processing your data for purposes of scientific or historical research and statistics.

To submit a request to exercise your rights, please use the request form located [here](https://www.requesteasy.com/63ac-6157) or contact us at privacy@sonatype.com. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request, or may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.

Individuals located in the UK, EEA, and Switzerland also have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing or profiling that we carry out for direct marketing purposes. You can do this by following the instructions included in the applicable message, by setting preferences as may be otherwise indicated on the site or event page, by using the request form [here](https://www.requesteasy.com/63ac-6157) or by contacting us at privacy@sonatype.com. If you have consented to receive direct marketing from third parties (such as affiliated Sonatype companies, business partners or independent resellers), please follow those third parties' opt-out processes.

Please note that we will send you service-related email announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. You do not have an option to opt out of these emails, which are not promotional in nature.

We may transfer personal data outside the UK and EEA and Switzerland to the U.S. When required, we make such transfers from the EEA and Switzerland in compliance with the Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers from the European Economic Area to third countries, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021(as modified for compliance with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act where necessary), and from the UK in compliance with the international  data transfer addendum to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international data transfers issued under Section 119A of the Data Protection Act of 2018.

## **EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework with UK Extension, and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework**

Sonatype, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (UK Extension), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). We have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce our adherence to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension and our adherence to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles (as applicable), the Principles shall govern. Click [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/) to learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search) to view our certification.

EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have rights to access their Personal Data held by Sonatype, Inc. and to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, or has been processing in violation of the Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks of the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals may also opt-out of Sonatype, Inc.’s disclosure of their Personal Data to a third party (excluding a third party contracted as an agent to perform tasks(s) on our behalf and under our instruction), or use of their Personal Data for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. In the unlikely event that Sonatype, Inc. obtains Personal Data of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals that is “sensitive information” (i.e., specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origins, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or information specifying sex life), we will obtain affirmative express consent from the individual before disclosing such information to a third party or using it for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. In addition, Sonatype, Inc. will treat as sensitive any Personal Data received from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive. To submit a request to exercise these rights or to opt-out of disclosure of Personal Data, please use the request form located [here](https://www.requesteasy.com/63ac-6157) or contact us at privacy@sonatype.com. Additional information about rights and choices regarding Personal Data of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals is provided above at the beginning of the section “Information for Individuals Located in the UK, EEA, and Switzerland.”

Sonatype, Inc. complies with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU, UK, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. Our compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension, and Swiss-U.S. DPF is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.

Sonatype, Inc. commits to resolving DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss U.S. DPF. You may submit inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of Personal Data to Sonatype, Inc.’s General Counsel by using the request form located [here](https://www.requesteasy.com/63ac-6157) or contacting privacy@sonatype.com.

Sonatype, Inc. also commits to referring unresolved complaints concerning our handling of such data to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request> for more information or to file a complaint.  The TRUSTe services are provided at no cost to you.

For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found in [Annex 1 of the DPF Principles](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2).

# CVE-2022-45868

# H2 - Plaintext password

H2 has a web-based admin console that can be started via the CLI. One of the arguments is -webAdminPassword, which allows the user to specify the password in plaintext for the web admin console. Consequently, a malicious local user or an attacker that has obtained local access through some means would be able to get the password for the H2 web admin console by looking at the running processes.

VERSIONS AFFECTED:  From 1.4.198 to the latest (from the time of this report, version 2.1.214 is also vulnerable)

SCORE: 8.4 CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

Proof of Concept

Consider the following docker file and h2.server.properties file used by docker.

* Dockerfile:

FROM openjdk:11
ENV DOWNLOAD https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases/download/version-2.1.214/h2-2022-06-13.zipENV DATA\_DIR /opt/h2-data
RUN groupadd --gid 1000 guest \    && useradd --uid 1000 --gid guest --shell /bin/bash --create-home guest
RUN mkdir -p ${DATA\_DIR}RUN curl -L ${DOWNLOAD} -o h2.zipRUN unzip h2.zip -d /opt/RUN rm h2.zip
COPY h2.server.properties /root/.h2.server.propertiesWORKDIR /opt/h2-dataEXPOSE 8090 1521
CMD java  -cp /opt/h2/bin/h2\*.jar org.h2.tools.Server ${H2\_OPTIONS}

* h2.server.properties file:

webAdminPassword=123456webSSL=falsewebAllowOthers=truewebPort=8090tcp=truetcpAllowOthers=truetcpPort=15210=Generic H2 (Embedded)|org.h2.Driver|jdbc\:h2\:test|sa1=Generic H2 (Server) Old Information Schema|org.h2.Driver|jdbc\:h2\:tcp\://localhost\:1521/test;OLD\_INFORMATION\_SCHEMA\=TRUE|sa2=Generic H2 (Server) MariaDB Mode|org.h2.Driver|jdbc\:h2\:tcp\://localhost\:1521/test;MODE\=MariaDB;|sa3=Generic H2 (Server)|org.h2.Driver|jdbc\:h2\:tcp\://localhost\:1521/test|sa

With these two files, we run the docker file with something similar to this:

docker build --no-cache -t h2poc .docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -p 8090:8090 -e H2\_OPTIONS="-webAdminPassword 1234" --name=h2poc h2poc

Once the docker instance is running, we can execute the following command in the instance running as a guest user:

docker exec --user guest h2poc ps -aux

This will reveal the process list and the arguments used to run them, including h2 with the password in plaintext in some form like this:

USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMANDroot         1  0.0  0.0   2420   568 ?        Ss   19:30   0:00 /bin/sh -c java  -cp /opt/h2/bin/h2\*.jar org.h2.tools.Server ${H2\_OPTIONS}root         7  3.7  3.2 3883748 65532 ?       Sl   19:30   0:01 java -cp /opt/h2/bin/h2-2.1.214.jar org.h2.tools.Server -webAdminPassword 1234guest       62  0.0  0.1   8592  3280 ?        Rs   19:31   0:00 ps -aux

As an aside, it is interesting to note that the CLI argument overwrites what is specified in the potentially better-secured configuration file.

Impact

According to a developer of H2: "[Users with ADMIN privileges may do anything with your JVM and system by design](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3547#issuecomment-1156345578)".

This means that any user on a system running H2 that has been started with the webAdminPassword argument can get the administrator password and escalate their privileges to perform any action on the system that the owner of the H2 process would be able to.

Occurrences

<https://github.com/h2database/h2database/blob/96832bf5a97cdc0adc1f2066ed61c54990d66ab5/h2/src/main/org/h2/server/web/WebServer.java#L346-L347>

Maintainer answer

This is not a vulnerability of H2 Console, this is an example of how not to use it. I think there is nothing to do with it on H2 side. Passwords should never be passed on the command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to know that.

webAdminPassword is actually not related to privileges of users or users with ADMIN privileges. This is a password for server management tools of H2 Console (backup, restore, etc. without logon to a particular database itself)  and it is rarely appropriate to use these tools, especially in production, H2 Console is a tool for developers. And the most of developers don't know that these management tools ever exist. But if somebody knows them and needs them for a some special reason, password can be specified in .h2.server.properties. Documentation doesn't suggests any other ways. H2 rewrites password is this configuration file with its salted hash if configuration is saved from settings of H2 Console, so it is possible to use this secure format instead of plaintext form.  But people can always find new insecure places for sensitive settings and it isn't possible to imagine all possible ways to do that.

The mentioned WebServer class doesn't know how exactly password was specified. For example, application can read some password from its own secure configuration and pass it safely directly to this class. Unfortunately, I don't see a way to detect insecure configurations automatically.

Suggested fix provided

[https://github.com/h2database/h2database/compare/HEAD...sniffernandez:no-plaintext-password](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/compare/HEAD...sniffernandez%3Ano-plaintext-password)

We agree that passwords should never be passed on the command line and that H2 be expected to account for creative password storage solutions.

What we’re trying to report is related specifically to [these lines here](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/blob/96832bf5a97cdc0adc1f2066ed61c54990d66ab5/h2/src/main/org/h2/server/web/WebServer.java#L346-L347). H2 is specifically accepting a -webAdminPassword argument on the command line to use as the web console’s password on execution. In addition, because the line is after [where H2 reads the more secure config file](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/blob/96832bf5a97cdc0adc1f2066ed61c54990d66ab5/h2/src/main/org/h2/server/web/WebServer.java#L325), the command line argument will then overwrite whatever is written in the config file. This seems to be an undesired behavior in H2 with security implications.

Considering documentation doesn't suggest any other way than using the file config, a fix could be [removing the -webAdminPassword as a valid CLI argument](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/commit/fd85ea22277c98cfa5dbc072cefa2c46eff9ef46). Another thing to improve the security is to read the CLI arguments and [after that set the values provided by the loadProperties () function](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/commit/819c88a4be2ab0a12a92a57f810cff87de53172d).

# Terms of Service

### 1. Acceptance of Terms:

Welcome! Sonatype, Inc. ("Sonatype" or "us" or "we") welcomes you to Sonatype.com and related sub-domains. These Terms of Service govern your use of our websites and all related forums, documentation and other services you access through the websites (the "Service"). However, if you download software or purchase training, support, subscriptions or other services or products from us, those products and services are governed by the separate license or purchase terms made available in connection with such products or services.

By using or accessing any part of the Service, you are agreeing to these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy and all other policies or notices posted by us on our websites.

If you don't agree to these Terms of Service, don't use the Service. We can change these Terms of Service at any time without any notice to you. It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service from time to time for any changes as it creates a binding legal agreement between you and Sonatype. If you use the Service after we've changed any of the Terms of Service, you are agreeing to all of the changes. Again, if you do not agree, don't use the Service.

### 2. Permission to Use the Service

You have our permission to use the Service, but only if:

* you are over 16 years old;
* you do not copy the Service or any part of the Service;
* you do not modify the Service or any part of the Service;
* you follow all the rules and restrictions we've spelled out in these Terms of Service.

### 3. Accounts; Passwords; Security

You may need to set up an account in order to use some of the features of the Service. You may not use someone else's account without permission. When you are setting up your account, you must give us accurate and complete information. This means that you cannot set up an account using someone else's name or contact information, or a phony name or phony contact information. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account. This means you need to be careful with your password. If you find out that someone is using your account without your permission, you must let us know immediately. You may not transfer your account to someone else. We are not liable for any damages or losses caused by someone using your account without your permission. However, if we (or anyone else) suffer any damage due to the unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable.

To access certain features of the website, or in conjunction with your use of the Service, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, ZIP code, and date of birth. Our use of any personally identifiable information you provide to us as part of the registration process is governed by the terms of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.sonatype.com/privacy-policy).

### 4. Personal Use Only

We are making the Service available to you for your information and personal use only. You may not (and you agree not to) use, copy, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, or do anything else with the Service for any other purpose.

### 5. User Content

You are solely responsible for any User Content you post to the Service, and the consequences of posting or publishing it. By "User Content", we mean any Content you post to the Service. "Content" means information, data, text, software, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or any other materials. When we say "post", we include posting, uploading, sharing, submitting or otherwise providing User Content in any manner in connection with the Service.

### 6. Restrictions on User Content and Your Conduct

You may not:

* use our Service for any illegal purpose;
* submit User Content that you don't have the right to submit, unless you have the owner's permission; this includes material covered by someone else's copyright, patent, trade secret, privacy, publicity, or any other proprietary right;
* forge headers or manipulate other identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any User Content you submit;
* submit any User Content that contains lies, falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage us or anyone else;
* submit User Content that is illegal, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate;
* transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of solicitation;
* impersonate anyone else or lie about your affiliation with another person or entity;
* use meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing any of our or our suppliers' product names or trademarks;
* upload, launch, post, email or transmit any material (including any bot, worm, scripting exploit or computer virus) that is likely to harm or corrupt our Service, or harm or corrupt our or anyone else's computer systems, or data;
* use our Service to harm minors in any way, including posting User Content that violates child pornography laws, child sexual exploitation laws, or any other laws protecting children;
* collect or gather other people's personal information (including account information) from our Service;
* submit User Content which disparages us or our partners, vendor or affiliates; or
* solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of our Service.

We have the sole right, but not necessarily the obligation, to delete at any time any User Content that violates these rules or that we believe to be inappropriate for any reason.

### 7. Intellectual Property Rights in User Content

If you post User Content, you are making a guarantee to us that you either own all the Content you are posting, or you have the right to post the Content. Furthermore, you are guaranteeing that you have the right to allow us to make your User Content available for others to view and use as part of the Service without requiring that any such use be subject to additional obligations or terms. If you do not have these rights, do not post the Content. By posting your User Content, you do not lose any ownership rights you may have to it. However, you do grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform your User Content in connection with the Service and our business, in any media formats or in tangible form and through any media channels now known or hereinafter developed.

### 8. User Content You Share becomes Public

You understand that once you post User Content it becomes public. We are not responsible for keeping any User Content confidential. So, if you don't want the whole world to see it, don't post it on the Service.

### 9. We Are Not Responsible for User Content

We generally do not review any of the User Content posted by our users. We do not endorse any User Content or support any views, opinions, recommendations, or advice that may be in user submissions. User Content comes from a variety of sources, and we make no promises about the reliability of any source or the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of any user submission. You may be offended by User Content that you see on the Service. You may find some of it to be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. However, you agree not to hold us responsible in any way for your use of our Service, including your exposure to User Content.

### 10. Proprietary Rights

Sonatype and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all copyright, trade secret, patent and other rights) in and to the Service and Content which is included in the Service (other than User Content). If you give feedback on the Service, for example recommendations for improvements or features, implementation of that feedback is owned by us and may become part of the Service without compensation to you. We reserve all rights in and to the Service unless we expressly state otherwise. The Service contains proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.

You may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the Service to a human-perceivable form, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law, and in that case, only if you notify us in writing in advance. You may not copy, frameset, enclose or otherwise distribute any part of the Service.

All brand, product and service names used in the Service which identify Sonatype or our suppliers and our or their proprietary products and services are the trademarks or service marks of Sonatype or our suppliers. Nothing in this Service shall be deemed to confer on any person any license or right on the part of Sonatype or such supplier with respect to any such image, logo or name.

You agree not to disable, interfere, or try to get around any of the features of the Service related to security, preventing or restricting use or copying of any Content, or enforcing the limits on the use of the Service or the Content on the Service.

### 11. Enforcement of Copyrights

We respect the intellectual property rights of others. You may not use our Service to infringe anyone else's copyright or other intellectual property right. If we find out that you are infringing, we will remove your User Content. We do not have to give you notice that we are removing your User Content. We may also terminate your account if we decide that you are a repeat infringer. We consider a repeat infringer to be a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice or who has had User Content removed from our Service more than twice.

### 12. Notify Us of Infringers

If you believe that something on our Service violates your copyright, notify our copyright agent in writing. The contact information for our copyright agent is at the bottom of this section.

In order for us to take action, you must do the following in your notice:

* provide your physical or electronic signature;
* identify the copyrighted work that you believe is being infringed;

* provide us with a way to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, or e-mail;
* provide a statement that you believe in good faith that the item you have identified as infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law to be used on our Service; and
* provide a statement that the information you provide in your notice is accurate, and that (under penalty of perjury), you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner whose work is being infringed.

Only notices about copyright infringement should go to our copyright enforcement department. If you have anything else to communicate with us (like feedback, comments, requests for technical support), you should contact us through our [contact page](https://www.sonatype.com/contactus).

### 14. Storage and Availability

We are not a content-archiving service. We do not promise to store or make available on our Service any User Content that you submit, or any other Content, for any length of time. You are solely responsible for keeping back-ups of everything you post on our Service.

You acknowledge that temporary interruptions in the availability of the Service may occur from time to time as normal events. Also, we may decide to cease making available the Service or any portion of the Service at any time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will Sonatype or its suppliers be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability.

### 15. Sale of Products

Our Service may include the offer for sale of certain products (whether software, services, or other merchandise) ("Products"). Any offer for sale or purchase of such Products is subject to the licenses, terms of sale and warranty (if any) provisions for the particular Product through our Service (including through any shopping cart for the particular Product).

### 16. Links to Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to other websites that we don't own or control. We are not responsible for any of these other websites. You will not hold us responsible for any aspect of these other websites, including their content, privacy policies, or anything else. You may be exposed to things on other websites that you don't like or that you find offensive. We are not responsible for this, either. You must use your own discretion when you go to other websites. You should also read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of these other websites.

### 17. Warranty Disclaimer

USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON A "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT (i) THE SERVICE OR ANY PRODUCTS PURCHASED THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (ii) THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE; OR (iii) THAT THERE WILL BE NO ERRORS IN THE SERVICE OR THAT COMPANY WILL FIX ANY ERRORS. ANY MATERIALS OBTAINED THROUGH USE OF THE SERVICE ARE OBTAINED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND COMPANY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR COMPUTER OR DATA OR FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES OR OTHER DESTRUCTIVE CODE RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

### 18. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS HAVE NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE OR PROFIT) ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES TO DAMAGES ARISING FROM (i) YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE OUR SERVICE; (ii) COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED THROUGH OR FROM OUR SERVICE; (iii) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR USER CONTENT; (iv) THIRD PARTY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE OR (v) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, COMPANY’S LIABILITY AND THE LIABILITY OF EACH OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, INVESTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVERTISERS, LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER CONTRACTORS TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF $100.

### 19. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Sonatype and its affiliates, suppliers, partners, officers, agents, and employees from and against any claim, demand, losses, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from any User Content, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of these Terms of Service or your violation of any rights of any third-party. Your indemnification obligation will survive the termination of these Terms of Service and your use of the Service.

### 20. Termination and Suspension

We may terminate or suspend the Service or any part of the Service, terminate or suspend or your use of the Service, block any IP address, or remove any of your User Content at any time, for any reason, with or without cause without any liability to you.

Further, we may terminate or suspend your permission to use the Service immediately and without notice upon any violation of these Terms of Service, your failure to pay any fees when due, upon the request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems or for engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities. If we terminate your use of the Service for any of these reasons or otherwise for cause, we will not refund any fees you may have paid, whether for access to the Service or for Products (if applicable).

Upon any termination we may delete your account, passwords and User Content and we may bar you from further use of the Service. You understand that we may also continue to make your User Content available on the Service even if your use of the Service is terminated or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of your account, User Content or access to the Service.

### 21 . Export Control

You may not use, export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of such Content, or any product or service offered on the Service, in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including, without limitation, United States export laws and regulations.

### 22. Additional Terms

Portions of the Service may be accompanied by additional terms which apply to specific features or areas of the Service. Those additional terms supplement these terms with respect to your use of those features or areas.

### 23. General Terms

These Terms of Service are governed by laws of the state of Maryland, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The sole jurisdiction and venue for any claim arising from the Service and these Terms of Service shall be the state and federal courts located in Maryland and each party hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. These Terms of Service, together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices we have published on the Service, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding this Service. If a court having proper authority decides that any portion of these Terms of Service is invalid, only the part that is invalid will not apply. The rest of these Terms of Service will still be in effect. If we waive any of our rights under these Terms of Service in any particular instance, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights generally or in the future. Furthermore, just because we may not enforce all our rights all of the time, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights. We may decide to enforce them at a later date. These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted under these Terms of Service, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction.

YOU AGREE THAT IF YOU WANT TO SUE US, YOU MUST FILE YOUR LAWSUIT WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO YOUR LAWSUIT. OTHERWISE, YOUR LAWSUIT WILL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.  YOU WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM, ACTION OR SUIT ASSERTED, BROUGHT OR ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
