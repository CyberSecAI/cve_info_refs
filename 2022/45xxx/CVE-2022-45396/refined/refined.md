Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45396:

**CVE-2022-45396**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** SourceMonitor Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 0.2 and earlier
*  **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin's XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can control XML input files processed by the 'Publish SourceMonitor results' post-build step. This allows the attacker to have the Jenkins agent parse a crafted XML file. This crafted file can use external entities for:
    *   Extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent.
    *   Server-side request forgery (SSRF).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to control XML input files for the 'Publish SourceMonitor results' post-build step
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control the XML files processed by the vulnerable build step.
     *   The attacker needs to have "Item/Configure" permission on the Jenkins project to modify build step configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory notes that the vulnerability's impact is limited to scenarios where attackers control XML files but cannot modify other aspects of the build process (build steps, Jenkinsfiles, etc.).
*   A fix is not available at the time of the advisory's publication.
