Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45157:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Rancher stored vSphere CPI and CSI credentials in plaintext within Rancher objects. This was happening when deploying clusters via the vSphere cloud provider.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Plaintext storage of credentials:** vSphere CPI and CSI passwords were being stored in plaintext within Rancher. Specifically, within `provisioning.cattle.io` objects, `rke.cattle.io.rkecontrolplane` objects, and in `plan` files on the provisioned downstream clusters' filesystems. This violates the principle of secure storage of sensitive data.
- **Exposure through multiple channels:** The passwords were accessible through multiple channels - by users who are cluster members of the provisioned clusters through Rancher's UI and API, and by users with privileged access to the cluster infrastructure (host OS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to vSphere credentials could lead to a compromise of the vSphere environment, allowing attackers to control virtual machines, storage, and other resources.
- **Privilege Escalation:** With vSphere credentials, attackers can gain elevated privileges within the vSphere environment, potentially moving laterally into other systems or data centers.
- **Data Exposure:** Access to vSphere might expose sensitive data stored within the virtual environment, potentially leading to data breaches.
- **Integrity and Availability:** The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized modification or deletion of VMs, or denial-of-service attacks within the virtual infrastructure, affecting the integrity and availability of services.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Rancher UI/API:** Users who are members of the provisioned clusters are able to access the plaintext credentials through Rancher's UI.
- **Direct access to cluster infrastructure:** Attackers with privileged access to the host OS of the provisioned clusters can access the passwords stored in the filesystem of the downstream clusters.
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is network accessible, implying that a malicious actor could exploit the vulnerability from a remote network location.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Rancher cluster membership:** An attacker needs to be a member of a cluster provisioned via the vSphere cloud provider in Rancher.
- **Privileged access to cluster infrastructure:** Alternatively, attackers with access to the host OS of the cluster nodes could also access the stored credentials.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to Rancher.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Rancher versions >=2.9.0,<2.9.3, >=2.8.0,<2.8.9, and >=2.7.0.
- Patched versions are 2.9.3 and 2.8.9.
- A script is required after updating to mitigate the vulnerability in existing vSphere clusters. The script migrates the credentials to secrets in the `fleet-default` namespace.
- The `provisioningprebootstrap` feature flag must be enabled after updating.
- There is no backport patch for the Rancher 2.7 release line.
- The CVSS score is 9.1, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L.
- The associated CWE is CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials).
