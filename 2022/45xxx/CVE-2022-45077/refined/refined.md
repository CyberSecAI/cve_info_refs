Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-45077

**Description:** The Betheme WordPress theme, in versions up to and including 26.5.1.4, is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the theme's handling of user-supplied data, which allows an attacker to inject serialized PHP objects. When these objects are unserialized by the application, they can lead to code execution if a suitable POP chain is present.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious PHP objects through user-supplied data.
*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The theme does not properly validate or sanitize data before deserializing it, leading to the injection vulnerability.
   
**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a proper POP chain exists, an attacker can achieve remote code execution, allowing them to run arbitrary code on the server. This includes the ability to perform SQL injection, path traversal, denial-of-service attacks, and potentially more.
*   **Website Takeover:** Successful exploitation can lead to full website compromise, including data theft, defacement, and malware injection.
    
**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered through user-supplied data, but specific vectors are not detailed in the content. However, it is common for such vulnerabilities to be triggered via crafted HTTP requests or by exploiting input fields that are not adequately sanitized.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to submit malicious input to the vulnerable WordPress theme.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid payload with the necessary POP chain to achieve the desired impact.
*   Privilege level needed is "Subscriber", meaning any authenticated user can exploit this.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered high priority, and it was known to be exploited in the wild.
*   A patch is available in version 26.6 of the theme.
*   Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the issue.
*  The CVSS score is 6.3.
