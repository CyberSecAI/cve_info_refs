The provided content details a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Tenda AC6V1.0 router, specifically in the `formSetVirtualSer` function.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `httpd` module when handling `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` requests. Specifically, the `list` parameter is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to send a large string that exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation of the `list` parameter in the `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a Denial-of-Service (DoS). The large input causes a crash of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` endpoint with an overly long `list` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device. This would likely require being on the same network or having the router's management interface exposed.

The content provides a good level of detail, including the vulnerable firmware version, a code snippet showing the likely vulnerable function, and a PoC.
