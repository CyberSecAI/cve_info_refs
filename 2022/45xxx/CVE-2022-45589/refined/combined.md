| CVE-2023-31444 | 🟥  High | Talend Studio microservices allow unauthenticated access to the Jolokia endpoint of the microservice. This allows for remote access to the JVM via the Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge. Please note that only Talend Studio microservice deployments are impacted, Talend Studio itself and other Talend Studio components are not impacted. The ESB Runtime is also not impacted. Please update to at least versions 8.0.1-R2022-09 or 7.3.1-R2022-10 to fix the issue | 8.0.1-R2022-097.3.1-R2022-10 | 04/28/2023 | [Read more](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31444) |

**CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL 3.0.x**

Talend is aware of and monitoring the [pre-announced](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-October/000238.html) OpenSSL 3.x (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786) security vulnerability.

Talend is scoping the remediation efforts throughout its Product portfolio and is in the process of developing fixes and remediations to address the vulnerability.

﻿

Update: November 1, 2022

To the best of our knowledge and the information currently available, Talend products are **not impacted** by \*\* CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 \*\* security vulnerabilities present in OpenSSL 3.0.x

While not directly exposed to vulnerable version of OpenSSL, we have proactively implemented preventative mitigations and continuous monitoring in Talend Cloud as an added precaution.

﻿**Apache Commons Text variable interpolation (CVE-2022-42889)**

Talend is aware of and monitoring CVE-2022-42889 (Apache Commons Text aka Text4Shell) security vulnerability.

﻿

Update: October 24, 2022

The Apache Commons Text vulnerability CVE-2022-42889 only applies when the StringSubstitutor API is used with untrusted input. At Talend, we do not use the StringSubstitutor API directly in any of our on-prem products with untrusted input. We have not found any instance of a third-party dependency that we include with our products that uses StringSubstitutor in an insecure way. However, to fully remediate the issue we will be updating the Commons Text version for all our of impacted products.

The Apache Security team have released a statement to clarify the impact of CVE-2022-42889: <https://blogs.apache.org/security/entry/cve-2022-42889>

*"This issue is different from Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) because in Log4Shell, string interpolation was possible from the log message body, which commonly contains untrusted input. In the Apache Common Text issue, the relevant method is explicitly intended and clearly documented to perform string interpolation, so it is much less likely that applications would inadvertently pass in untrusted input without proper validation."*
