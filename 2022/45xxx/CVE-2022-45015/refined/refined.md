    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have access to the WBCE CMS admin panel and be able to modify the search settings. Specifically, they need to have access to the "Results Footer" field.
- The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code into the "Results Footer" field under the search settings.
- When a user performs a search on the website, the malicious script is executed within the context of that user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Admin level access to WBCE CMS to access search settings and "Results Footer" field.
