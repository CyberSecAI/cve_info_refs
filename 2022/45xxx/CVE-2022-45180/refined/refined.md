**Summary of CVE-2022-45180:**

This CVE highlights a significant flaw in the LiveBox Collaboration vDesk application. The lack of proper access controls on the `/export` API endpoint allows low-privileged users to gain access to sensitive information about all users on the system. This could have substantial security and privacy implications for the users of the platform and the organization using the software.

This response provides a detailed overview of all CVEs listed in the document, however, it is important to note that the focus and specifics extracted are based on the provided information and can be further explored with official CVE records and vendor advisories.
