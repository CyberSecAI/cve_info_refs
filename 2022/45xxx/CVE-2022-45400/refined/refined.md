Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45400:

**CVE-2022-45400**

*   **Vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
*   **Affected Plugin:** JAPEX Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.7 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The JAPEX Plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE injection.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Attackers can control XML input files for the 'Record Japex test report' post-build step. By including malicious external entities within these XML files, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability when the plugin parses them.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to control the XML input files that the 'Record Japex test report' post-build step processes. This could mean the attacker can modify the job configuration, or the job is configured to use input files from untrusted sources.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the Jenkins controller by using specially crafted XML files, due to the ability to access local files.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can perform SSRF attacks, making the Jenkins controller send requests to internal or external servers the attacker controls, potentially leading to further compromise of the network.
*   **Mitigation:** There is no fix available as of the publication of the advisory. The recommended mitigation is to restrict who can modify job configurations and control XML files used in the build steps.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability occurs because the XML parser in the JAPEX Plugin isn't configured to prevent external entity resolution, a common source of XXE vulnerabilities.
