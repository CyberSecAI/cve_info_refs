Missing Authentication Vulnerabilities related to file

system of CS/CJ-series Programmable Controllers

No. OMSR-2023-002_en (  1  /  4  )

Release date: April 17, 2023

OMRON  Corporation

■Overview

Missing  Authentication  for  Critical  Function  (CWE-306)  vulnerabilities  exist  in  the  CS/CJ-

series Programmable Controllers.

An attacker may use these vulnerabilities to access to the file system (Memory card or EM file

memory)  provided  by  the  CPU  Unit  without  authentication  and  obtain  available  sensitive

information.

.

The  products  and  versions  affected  by  these  vulnerabilities,  mitigation  and  protection

measures are shown below. Make sure to implement these recommended mitigations and

protections to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

■Description

Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345) vulnerabilities exist in the  CS/CJ-

No. OMSR-2023-002_en (  2  /  4  )

series Programmable Controllers.

■Potential threats and impacts

      An attacker may use these vulnerabilities to access to the file system (Memory card or EM

file memory) provided by the CPU Unit without authentication and obtain available sensitive

information.

■CVSS Scores

      Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)

      CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N Base Score 7.5

■Mitigations and Protections

OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk

of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

1. Security measures to prevent unauthorized access

- If the following products and versions are used, the risk for which an attacker will access to

the  file  system  (Memory  card  or  EM  file  memory)  provided  by  the  CPU  Unit  without

authentication via a network can be reduced by taking following measure 1).

1) Enable the FINS write protection function.

      Moreover, OMRON recommends that customers take the following measures.

- Minimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks, so that untrusted

devices will be unable to access them.

-  Implement

firewalls  (by  shutting  down  unused  communications  ports,

limiting

communications hosts, limiting access to FINS port (9600)) and isolate them from the IT

network.

- Use a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access to control systems and equipment.

- Use strong passwords and change them frequently.

No. OMSR-2023-002_en (  4  /  4  )

- Install physical controls so that only authorized personnel can access control systems and

equipment.

- Scan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting them to

systems and devices.

- Enforce multifactor authentication to all devices with remote access to control systems and

equipment whenever possible.

2. Anti-virus protection

Protect any PC with access to the control system against malware and ensure installation and

maintenance of up-to-date commercial grade anti-virus software protection.

3. Data input and output protection

Validation processing such as backup and range check to cope with unintentional modification

of input/output data to control systems and devices.

4. Data recovery

        Periodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.
