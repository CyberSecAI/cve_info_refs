  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize the `assignment_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query within the `else` branch of a conditional statement in `CalendarModal.php`. This occurs when the `event_id` parameter is empty or not set, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to full database information disclosure, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of students and teachers, grades, settings, and user passwords.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid user account (including student accounts) to access the vulnerable page and inject the malicious SQL query using `assignment_id`."
