  "CVE-2022-45729": {
    "Description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Doctor Appointment Management System v1.0.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the Employee ID parameter.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `fname` parameter before reflecting it back to the user's browser.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or sensitive information, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted payload injected into the vulnerable parameter, likely via a web form or URL.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code into the vulnerable 'fname' parameter. The attack can be local, meaning the attacker doesn't necessarily need to be a remote user, which suggests a lack of input sanitization on the server-side and in context of the web application."
