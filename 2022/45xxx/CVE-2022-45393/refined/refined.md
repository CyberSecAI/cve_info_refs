Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45393:

**CVE-2022-45393**

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Missing Permission Check
*   **Affected Plugin:** Delete log Plugin (versions 1.0 and earlier)
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The Delete log Plugin's HTTP endpoint lacks a permission check, allowing unauthorized users to access it.
    *   The endpoint does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The HTTP endpoint for deleting build logs does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform this action.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The endpoint accepts GET requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks, where an attacker can trick a legitimate user into performing an unintended action.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers with `Item/Read` permission can delete build logs without proper authorization.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Missing permission check**: An attacker with `Item/Read` permission can directly access the vulnerable endpoint to delete logs.
    *   **CSRF**: An attacker can craft a malicious link or embed a form on a website that, when clicked by a logged-in user with `Item/Read` permission, will trigger the deletion of build logs on the Jenkins server without the user's knowledge or consent.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have at least `Item/Read` permission on the Jenkins instance to exploit the missing permission check.
    *   To exploit the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in Jenkins user with `Item/Read` permissions into interacting with a crafted malicious link/form.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory states that there is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Medium" severity.
