Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `webbrowser.rs` library prior to version 0.8.3 fails to properly validate if the provided input is a URL before passing it to the system's open command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of URL Validation:** The library does not check if the input string is a valid URL.
- **Direct System Command Execution:** On Windows, the library uses `shellExecuteW`, passing the user-controlled string as the `lpFile` argument which can lead to opening arbitrary local files or executing commands.
- **Unfiltered Input to ShellExecuteW**: The attacker can control the 'lpFile' argument in `shellExecuteW` on Windows.
- **Arbitrary command execution:** By providing a path to a script file or command with one argument, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can open local files on the victim's machine.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands.
- **Privilege escalation:** While not explicitly stated, arbitrary command execution could potentially be leveraged for privilege escalation depending on the context and what commands are used

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unfiltered URL Input:** The attacker must provide a malicious string to the `webbrowser::open()` function.
- **Manipulation of `lpFile` Argument (Windows):** On Windows, an attacker can provide a file path or command as the `lpFile` argument in the `shellExecuteW` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control Over Input:** The attacker needs to control the URL passed to the vulnerable function.
- **Local File System Access (for Local File Access)**: For local file access, the attacker needs to have information about file paths on the victim's machine.
- **Understanding of `open` or `shellExecuteW` behavior:** The attacker needs to understand how open or shellExecuteW works to craft a successful exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation in the `webbrowser.rs` library.
- The library uses `shellExecuteW` on Windows, passing the unvalidated URL as the `lpFile` argument, which can be exploited to open local files or execute commands.
- The vulnerability is not reproducible on Linux in terms of arbitrary command execution, but local files can be accessed via path.
- The provided POC includes screenshots that are relevant, one showing the vulnerable code and another one demonstrating the reverse shell execution.
