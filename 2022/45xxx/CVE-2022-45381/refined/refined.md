Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-45381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `readProperties` Pipeline step in the Pipeline Utility Steps Plugin, which uses the Apache Commons Configuration library for variable interpolation, does not restrict the set of enabled prefix interpolators. The plugin bundles a version of the library which enables the `file:` prefix interpolator by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The enabled `file:` prefix interpolator allows reading arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller file system.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The default configuration enables a potentially dangerous feature without proper restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can read sensitive files on the Jenkins controller's file system. This could include configuration files, secrets, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to configure a Pipeline that uses the vulnerable `readProperties` step.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to have the ability to configure Jenkins pipelines. This may require having some level of Jenkins user permissions.
