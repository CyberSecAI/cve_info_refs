Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `/goform/SysToolRestoreSet` interface in Tenda AX12 firmware allows a device reset to factory settings via a GET request without proper CSRF protection, once a user has authenticated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The vulnerability lies in the lack of CSRF protection on the `/goform/SysToolRestoreSet` interface. An attacker can trick a logged-in user's browser into sending a request to this endpoint, leading to a device reset.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Device Reset to Factory Settings:** An attacker can force the Tenda AX12 router to reset to its factory default state. This would erase user configurations and require the user to reconfigure the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Website/Email:** An attacker could embed a malicious link or script within a website or email. If a user, currently logged into the router's administration panel, visits this malicious content, the script would silently make a request to the `/goform/SysToolRestoreSet` endpoint, triggering the reset.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker does not need to know the user's credentials but requires the user to be logged into the router's web interface.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to interact with a crafted malicious link or webpage while authenticated to the router.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to induce the victim's browser to send the malicious request to the router. This can happen if the user is on the same network as the router or if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a Python script that demonstrates the exploit. It is a simple GET request that triggers the reset. The request, however, will require prior authentication to the router's web interface, which is implicitly assumed in the exploit demonstration.
- The vulnerability is described as existing in Tenda-AX12 V22.03.01.21\_CN.
- The content includes images showing the user interface and the effect of the exploit.
