The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in WBCE CMS version 1.5.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Section name" field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code directly into the system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary web script execution in the context of the victim's browser when they view the page containing the malicious section name.
- Potential for account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Section Name" field via the CMS backend.
- When a user visits a page displaying the section, the malicious script executes in their browser

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires access to the WBCE CMS backend with sufficient privileges to create and manage pages and sections.
- The attacker needs to be able to edit the "Section Name" field and access the source view option.
