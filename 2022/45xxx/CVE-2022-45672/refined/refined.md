- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` module when handling `/goform/wx3auth` requests. This is caused by insufficient bounds checking when processing the `data` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to the crash caused by the buffer overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/goform/wx3auth` endpoint with an overly long `data` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected router's web interface. This likely requires being on the same network as the router or having access to it via port forwarding or other means.
