- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs in the `formPortalAuth` function due to the `gotoUrl` parameter being directly copied to a stack-based local variable using `strcpy`, without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The use of `strcpy` on user-supplied data without validation allows for a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Overwriting the return address on the stack allows an attacker to redirect program execution to an arbitrary address, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted `gotoUrl` parameter with a length exceeding the buffer's capacity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests with the vulnerable `gotoUrl` parameter to the router.
