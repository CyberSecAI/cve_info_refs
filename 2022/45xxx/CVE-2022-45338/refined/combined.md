|  | [Description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the profile picture upload |
|  | function of Exact Synergy Enterprise 267 before 267SP13 and Exact |
|  | Synergy Enterprise 500 before 500SP6 allows attackers to execute |
|  | arbitrary JavaScript-code via a crafted SVG file. |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Additional Information] |
|  | The profile picture upload functionality in Exact Synergy Enterprise before 267SP13 and 500SP6 allowed for the upload of SVG images. An attacker could upload a SVG image with arbitrary JavaScript code. This file would be accepted by the application and stored on the server of the application. The crafted SVG could then be included in the 'Workspace' functionality in the application by including it in an <iframe>-tag. An attacker could craft a 'Workspace' that executed the arbitrary JavaScript code in the crafted SVG image in the context of the browser of a victim. |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
