{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating or editing dashboards, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the 'name' parameter of a dashboard.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the dashboard. This can be used to perform malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to create a new dashboard by navigating to Reporting -> Dashboard and include the malicious payload within the 'name' parameter of the dashboard.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a user account with the ability to create dashboards within the application, which may require high privileges."
