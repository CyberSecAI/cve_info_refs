Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45380:

**CVE-2022-45380**

*   **Root Cause:** The JUnit Plugin converts HTTP(S) URLs in test report output to clickable links, but does so in an unsafe manner.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize or encode the URLs, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into test report output, which can then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the reports, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware delivery
    *   Defacement

*   **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker injects malicious URLs into the test report output. This could happen by manipulating the build process or test results.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the `Item/Configure` permission to modify job configurations, including test report output.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in JUnit Plugin versions 1159.v0b_396e1e07dd and earlier.
*   The fix in version 1160.vf1f01a_a_ea_b_7f removes the functionality that converts URLs to clickable links, thus preventing the XSS.
