Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the use of string concatenation to build SQL queries in the `/sys/duplicate/check` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The initial attempt to prevent SQL injection by replacing `/**/` is insufficient as it can be bypassed using other SQL injection techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Data modification
    - Privilege escalation
    - Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `/sys/duplicate/check` endpoint.
- Attackers inject malicious SQL code through input parameters of this endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- They need knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the structure of the database being used.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in the JeecgBoot project.
- The initial fix involved replacing `/**/`, but this was easily bypassed using techniques like `updatexml()` with nested queries.
- The suggested fix was to remove `/**/` replacement and convert the entire input string to lowercase to check for `select` and other SQL keywords to prevent injection.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-45206.
