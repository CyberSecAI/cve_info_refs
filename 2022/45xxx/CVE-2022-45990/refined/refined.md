Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, which are related to an e-commerce website:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application copies the value of the `eMail` request parameter directly into an HTML tag attribute without proper sanitization. This attribute is enclosed in double quotes.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **HTML Injection:**  The lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Phishing:** An attacker can inject malicious links (e.g., to phishing sites) into the HTML, tricking users into visiting them.
    *   **Botnet Creation:** The attacker can potentially redirect users to sites that host malicious content to create botnets.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious payload in the `eMail` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/ecommerce/index.php`).

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `signup_script.php` script does not sanitize user inputs.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    *   **JavaScript Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows for injecting Javascript code within the application response.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Large POST request payloads could crash the MySQL server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **JavaScript execution:** Malicious Javascript can be executed client-side.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Large POST requests can crash the MySQL server, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious Javascript payload within the `eMail` parameter of `signup_script.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
     *   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/ecommerce/signup_script.php`).

**Summary of Exploits:**

*   **Exploit00:** Demonstrates the HTML injection vulnerability by embedding a link to a malicious website (`pornhub.com`) within the response.
*   **Exploit01:** Demonstrates the JavaScript injection and SQL injection vulnerability using a crafted payload that includes an `<img>` tag with a malicious `src` attribute.

This content provides more detail than the official CVE description, elaborating on the nature of the vulnerabilities, their exploitation, and the specific attack vectors. It describes the injection of both HTML and Javascript, and also how an attacker could overload the database with large POST request payloads.
