- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Flexible Elementor Panel Plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin, under their current authentication. The specific impact can vary on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted request that is triggered by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering a malicious request, for example by using social engineering or through a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
