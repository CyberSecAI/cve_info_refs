Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-45096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is described as a "User Interface Security Issue." This implies a flaw in how the user interface of the Dell PowerScale OneFS software handles certain interactions or configurations. An unauthenticated remote user can unintentionally cause an administrator to enable the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a security flaw in the user interface that, when exploited, can lead to information disclosure. The specifics of the user interface security issue is not elaborated on.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information may be revealed to the attacker.
*   **Compromise of Data Integrity:** Some impact to data integrity is possible, though the provided details indicate it is low.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the system.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user (administrator) to unknowingly enable the vulnerability through interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact remotely with the system's user interface.
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Affected Versions:**
* Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.0 through 9.3.0 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
*  The suggested workaround is to avoid manually starting or restarting disabled Likewise services. If they are manually started, the recommendation is to manually stop those services.
*   Upgrade to the latest RUP (Rollup Patch), specifically versions >= 9.1.0.25, >= 9.2.1.18, >= 9.4.0.9, or upgrade to a later version of PowerScale OneFS to remediate this issue, along with other security vulnerabilities discussed in the document.
