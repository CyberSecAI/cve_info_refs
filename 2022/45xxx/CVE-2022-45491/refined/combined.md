| Heap Overflow in json\_parse\_value() In `json_parse_value()`, there is a heap out-of-bound write. The bug can be triggered with an invocation of `json_parse_ex()` with specific flags combination. The root cause of this vulnerability is that the value transferred to `json_parse_value()` is not properly sanitized, and it is pointed to out-of-bound position.  Here is the output of Google ASAN when the vulnerability is triggerred:  ``` The flags is 0x5fd6d7d6d6247b16 ================================================================= ==5035==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x611000000110 at pc 0x5615f43f0b7e bp 0x7ffc2be6fcd0 sp 0x7ffc2be6fcc8 WRITE of size 8 at 0x611000000110 thread T0     #0 0x5615f43f0b7d in json_parse_value /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1959:19     #1 0x5615f43ef8f0 in json_parse_object /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1719:5     #2 0x5615f43f01c8 in json_parse_value /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1940:5     #3 0x5615f43f8c85 in json_parse_ex /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:2129:3     #4 0x5615f440f192 in main /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/fuzz.c:29:5     #5 0x7fee4e17bd8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16     #6 0x7fee4e17be3f in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:392:3     #7 0x5615f431d314 in _start (/home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/san+0x33314) (BuildId: a0e983e1c9c38a8763824dc5481f79d22fe8c82a)  0x611000000111 is located 0 bytes to the right of 209-byte region [0x611000000040,0x611000000111) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x5615f43a015e in __interceptor_malloc (/home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/san+0xb615e) (BuildId: a0e983e1c9c38a8763824dc5481f79d22fe8c82a)     #1 0x5615f43f7f15 in json_parse_ex /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:2088:18     #2 0x5615f440f192 in main /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/fuzz.c:29:5     #3 0x7fee4e17bd8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1959:19 in json_parse_value Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c227fff7fd0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c227fff7fe0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c227fff7ff0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c227fff8000: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c227fff8010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0c227fff8020: 00 00[01]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c227fff8030: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c227fff8040: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c227fff8050: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c227fff8060: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c227fff8070: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb ==5035==ABORTING  ```  The input to trigger this bug is attached. The first 8 bytes are the flags for `json_parse_ex()` and the rest is the content(src). Please use address sanitizer to reproduce the bug, as non-crash overflow is hard to detect or locate without shadow memory.

## Description

Heap Overflow in json\_parse\_value()

In json\_parse\_value(), there is a heap out-of-bound write. The bug can be triggered with an invocation of json\_parse\_ex() with specific flags combination. The root cause of this vulnerability is that the value transferred to json\_parse\_value() is not properly sanitized, and it is pointed to out-of-bound position.

Here is the output of Google ASAN when the vulnerability is triggerred:

# The flags is 0x5fd6d7d6d6247b16

The input to trigger this bug is attached. The first 8 bytes are the flags for json\_parse\_ex() and the rest is the content(src). Please use address sanitizer to reproduce the bug, as non-crash overflow is hard to detect or locate without shadow memory.
