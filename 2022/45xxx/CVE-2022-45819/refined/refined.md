- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Attack vectors**: Through a function that lacks proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  A user with "Subscriber" privileges is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
