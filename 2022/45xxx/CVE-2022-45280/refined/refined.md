Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The EyouCMS v1.6.0 application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization when adding a new friendship link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The application stores the malicious payload (JavaScript code) in the database without proper sanitization. This allows the payload to be executed when the data is retrieved and displayed to users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by adding a new friendship link. This code is executed within the browsers of users who access the affected pages (including the admin panel and potentially the home page), allowing attackers to:
    *   Steal user session cookies.
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   Modify page content.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of logged-in users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/login.php?m=admin&c=Links&a=add&_ajax=1&lang=cn`.
*   **Payload Injection:** The payload `javascript:alert(123)` is injected into the `url` parameter within the POST request data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the "friendship link" addition feature within the backend.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the input sanitization is inadequate on the `url` parameter.
*  **Network Access:**  The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
