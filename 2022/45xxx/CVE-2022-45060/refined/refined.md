{
  "CVE-2022-45060": {
    "Description": "A request forgery attack can be performed on Varnish Cache servers that have the HTTP/2 protocol turned on. An attacker may introduce characters through the HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This may in turn be used to successfully exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the Varnish server's improper handling of characters in HTTP/2 pseudo-headers when converting them to HTTP/1 requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of HTTP/2 pseudo-headers",
      "Generation of invalid HTTP/1 requests",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can forge requests, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in backend servers by sending invalid HTTP/1 requests through the Varnish cache.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed via maliciously crafted HTTP/2 requests that contain characters in the pseudo-headers that are invalid in HTTP/1.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the Varnish server. This requires network access to the server."
