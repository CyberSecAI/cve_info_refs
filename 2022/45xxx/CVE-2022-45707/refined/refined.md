- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs because the `rules` parameter is copied using `strcpy` to a local stack variable without proper bounds checking within the `formAddDnsHijack` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The usage of `strcpy` to copy the `rules` parameter without any bounds checking leads to a classic buffer overflow vulnerability on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Overwriting the return address allows an attacker to hijack the program execution flow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted `rules` parameter within the `formAddDnsHijack` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the router, specifically containing the malicious payload in the `rules` parameter. The attacker would likely need to be on the same network or have the ability to reach the device on the network.
