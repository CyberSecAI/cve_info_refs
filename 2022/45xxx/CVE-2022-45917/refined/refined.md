  "cveId": "CVE-2022-45917",
  "description": "The function shib_logout.php redirects the user to a URL specified in the \"return\" parameter. Since this parameter is not validated, an attacker can use it to redirect a victim to an arbitrary website. This is a powerful tool in phishing campaigns, as it allows hiding the malicious webpage behind a link that looks like it would take you to the real ILIAS webpage.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `shib_logout.php` function redirects users to a URL provided in the 'return' parameter without proper validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Open Redirect",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can redirect a victim to an arbitrary website, potentially leading to phishing attacks and credential theft.",
    "attackVectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with a 'return' parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled site.",
     "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a URL to include the 'return' parameter with the malicious redirect."
