**CVE-2022-45174 Analysis**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Improper authentication and broken two-factor authentication (2FA) bypass. Specifically, the application fails to properly check the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) backup codes for SAML users.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **CWE-287**: Improper Authentication. The application bypasses the 2FA check by accepting any string as a valid backup code for SAML users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the two-factor authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to SAML user accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   The attacker logs into the vDesk web application as a SAML user.
    *   The attacker chooses the "backup code" option during the authentication process.
    *   The attacker enters any arbitrary string as a backup code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to know valid credentials of an existing SAML user.
    *   The attacker needs network access to the affected application's login page.
