Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in EyouCMS, specifically related to the `ENV_GOBACK_URL` cookie. The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled data before using it to construct a part of the web page, specifically in the cookie value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs when malicious script is injected through a user request and reflected back in the response without proper sanitization.
- Insufficient input sanitization or output encoding of the `ENV_GOBACK_URL` cookie value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `ENV_GOBACK_URL` cookie.
- When the application uses this cookie value in its output, the injected script will execute in the victim's browser.
- This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cms/eyoucms/login.php?m=admin&c=Article&a=add&lang=cn`.
- The attacker manipulates the `ENV_GOBACK_URL` cookie to include malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request that includes the malicious cookie to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the cookie value (as it is set in the request headers).
- However, an admin user (or other authorized user) would need to trigger the reflection by visiting a page where the cookie value is used.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides in EyouCMS version 1.6.0-UTF8-SP1 or earlier.
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the injection through the `ENV_GOBACK_URL` cookie, which gets reflected and executes the injected JavaScript.
- The issue has been fixed in version 1.6.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered using "Corax".
