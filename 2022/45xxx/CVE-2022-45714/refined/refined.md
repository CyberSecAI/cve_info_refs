```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the use of `strcpy` to copy the `indexSet` parameter to a local variable on the stack without proper bounds checking in the `formQOSRuleDel` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `formQOSRuleDel` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The buffer overflow can overwrite the return address, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The `indexSet` parameter within the `formQOSRuleDel` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the router's web interface with a crafted `indexSet` parameter."
