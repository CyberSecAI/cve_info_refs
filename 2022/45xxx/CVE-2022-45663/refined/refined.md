Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` module of the Tenda i22 router firmware when handling the `/goform/WifiMacFilterSet` request. Specifically, the `index` parameter within the POST request is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow caused by the lack of proper bounds checking on the `index` parameter. The code doesn't validate the length of the input before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition, likely by crashing the `httpd` process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/WifiMacFilterSet`.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is named `index`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tenda i22 router. This could be via the local network or, if the router's management interface is exposed, via the internet.
- **HTTP Request Sending:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Tenda i22 router firmware version V1.0.0.3(4687).
- The PoC uses a long string of "a" characters for the `index` parameter (2068 characters according to Content-Length in POC) to cause the buffer overflow.
- The affected page is `/goform/WifiMacFilterSet`.
