- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `sprintf` function is used to concatenate a string without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to lack of size checking when using `sprintf` to construct a string in `/goform/SetIpBind`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability can cause the router to crash, and with a crafted exploit, an attacker can potentially gain a root shell.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetIpBind` endpoint with a large 'page' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface and must authenticate.
