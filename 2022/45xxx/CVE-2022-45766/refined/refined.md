Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45766:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of **hardcoded default administrator credentials** (username and PIN) in the Global Facilities Management System (GFMS) software. These credentials were found within a publicly available technical manual.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The software fails to enforce proper access controls, relying on easily discoverable default credentials for administrative access.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The use of hardcoded credentials presents a significant security flaw, as these credentials can be easily obtained by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view usernames, full names of key owners, and the purpose of each key.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can open or close electronic key boxes, reboot the system, and change alarm settings, potentially disrupting normal operations.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The ability to view sensitive information about keys and their owners compromises the confidentiality of the system.
*   **Accessibility and Dependability Issues:** Attackers can manipulate the system in ways that affect the accessibility and dependability of electronic key boxes.
*   **Full Compromise:** Attackers can change administrator credentials and web server security settings, gaining complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attack is performed remotely, allowing attackers to exploit the vulnerability from anywhere with network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the GFMS instance.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** Attackers need to know the default username and PIN, which are publicly available in a technical manual.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by students at Girls Learn Cyber, Inc. through open-source intelligence research on Shodan.
*   The vulnerability was successfully replicated across multiple instances of GFMS.
*   The affected product is Global Facilities Management System, version 3, by Key Systems, Inc.
