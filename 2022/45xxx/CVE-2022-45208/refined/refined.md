Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-45208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection in the `/sys/user/putRecycleBin` endpoint of the JeecgBoot application.
- The `sysUserMapper.xml` file, specifically the `revertLogicDeleted` function, does not perform any precompiling of SQL queries. This allows user-supplied input to directly affect the SQL query construction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly concatenates user-provided input into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied data before incorporating it into the SQL query.
-  No precompilation: The application doesn't use prepared statements, which would prevent the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Data Access:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can also potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers can use SQL injection to cause delays or errors in database operations by injecting payloads like `SLEEP('2')`, potentially disrupting the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP PUT requests to the `/sys/user/putRecycleBin` endpoint.
- **Malicious Parameters:** The `userIds` parameter in the request body is vulnerable to SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's server.
- **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `/sys/user/putRecycleBin` endpoint.
- **Authentication (potentially):** The provided example includes an `X-Access-Token`, so an attacker likely needs to be authenticated, though this wasn't explicitly stated.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker would need a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported on October 25, 2022, and closed on November 2, 2022, with a fix.
- The vulnerability is located in the `sysUserMapper.xml` file and `SysUserController.java`, `SysUserServiceImpl.java`.
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability using payloads such as `"a') OR SLEEP('2"` within the `userIds` parameter.
- The fix included in commit `51e2227bfe54f5d67b09411ee9a336750164e73d`
- This was part of a larger set of SQL injections as `sys/user/deleteRecycleBin` was also affected by sql injection issue #4125.
