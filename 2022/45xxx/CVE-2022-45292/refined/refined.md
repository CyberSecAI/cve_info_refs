- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Funkwhale invites do not permanently expire after being used for signup. If a user who signed up using an invite deletes their account, the invite becomes reusable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reusable invitation codes after account deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the system by repeatedly using the same invite to create multiple accounts, if they have an invite.
- **Attack vectors**: Requires an invitation code, and a user to delete their account that used said invite.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to obtain an invitation and have knowledge that invites become reusable when the associated user deletes their account.
