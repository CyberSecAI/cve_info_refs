Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45436:

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** Pandora FMS

**Affected Version:** <= v765

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists within the Network maps editor module. Specifically, it's triggered through the help button.

**Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the help functionality of the network maps editor module, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Attack Vector:**
1.  An attacker navigates to the Topology maps -> Network map section of the application.
2.  The attacker clicks on the help button, capturing the request in a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
3. The attacker injects a malicious XSS payload into the "b" parameter.
4. The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the injected payload.
5. The attacker uses some form of social engineering, like phishing, to trick a user with admin privileges into clicking the malicious link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: The attacker can steal the victim's session cookie and impersonate them, potentially gaining admin access.
    *   Data theft: Sensitive data can be stolen or manipulated through injected scripts.
    *   Malicious redirects: The user can be redirected to a different malicious site.
    *  Defacement: The page could be defaced
    *   Other malicious actions: The attacker can perform other actions that are within the scope of the user's permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the network map editor page.
*   The attacker requires the ability to capture and modify HTTP requests.
*   The attacker needs to persuade a victim to click a malicious URL

**CVSS Score:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (4.8 Medium).
