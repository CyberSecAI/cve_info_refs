- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formAddDnsForward` function. The `rules` parameter is directly copied to a local stack variable using `strcpy` without any bounds checking.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The use of `strcpy` without proper size validation makes the function susceptible to buffer overflows. The `rules` parameter, which is likely user-supplied, is directly copied into a buffer on the stack.

- **Impact of exploitation:** By overflowing the buffer with a controlled input, the return address of the function can be overwritten, allowing an attacker to hijack the control flow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `rules` parameter in the `formAddDnsForward` function. The specific mechanism of delivering this input is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted `rules` parameter to the vulnerable function. This implies some form of network access, either locally or remotely, to interact with the router's web interface or management interface. The provided information does not specify if authentication is required.
