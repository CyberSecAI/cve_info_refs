- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formIPMacBindAdd` function of IP-COM M50 routers due to the `rules` parameter, obtained from `webGetVar`, being directly copied using `strcpy` to a stack-allocated local variable in the `ipMacBindListStore` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `strcpy` with an uncontrolled input. The `rules` parameter is not validated for length, leading to potential overflow when copying it to a stack buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The buffer overflow can overwrite the function's return address, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The `rules` parameter is sent via a web request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to send a crafted request to the router's web interface containing an oversized value for the `rules` parameter.
