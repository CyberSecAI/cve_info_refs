  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` module when handling `/goform/SetOnlineDevName` requests due to insufficient bounds checking on the `devName` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetOnlineDevName` endpoint with an overly long `devName` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This likely means being on the same network as the router, or having remote access via a port forward or a similar setup."
