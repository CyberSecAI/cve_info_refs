  "CVE-2022-45473": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2022-45473",
      "Description": "In drachtio-server 0.8.18, /var/log/drachtio has mode 0777 and drachtio.log has mode 0666."
    },
    "Content": {
      "Root cause": "The drachtio-server creates the `/var/log/drachtio` directory with mode 777 and the `drachtio.log` file with mode 666.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "World-readable log file",

      "Attack vector": "Local access",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to the system."
    },
    "Resolution": {
      "Fix": "The issue was fixed by changing the permissions of the log directory and file to 770 (owner/group read/write/execute) and adding a `--globally-readable-logs` option in v0.8.19-rc12",
      "Commit": "https://github.com/drachtio/drachtio-server/commit/f791a9313c58a911ce09f465f4bba594243b29ec"
