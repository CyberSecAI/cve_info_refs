The provided content is related to CVE-2022-45658.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `httpd` module of the Tenda AC6V1.0 router firmware when handling `/goform/openSchedWifi` requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setSchedWifi` function, specifically when handling the `schedEndTime` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/openSchedWifi` with an overly long `schedEndTime` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router's web interface. The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have access to the router's web interface via network routing.
