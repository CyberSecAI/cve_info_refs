The provided content relates to CVE-2022-45285.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of server-side sanitization of HTML/JavaScript code in the "Advanced Contact form 7 DB" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the user in the response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the user's browser (e.g., an administrator) in the context of the vulnerable website. This can be used to perform actions such as: session hijacking, defacing the website, redirecting the user to a malicious website or stealing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a GET request with a crafted XSS payload injected into the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a victim, often using social engineering techniques. They also need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests to bypass client-side protections like URL encoding and server-side protections like backslash escaping using backticks instead of single or double quotes.
