- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Comments Import & Export plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSV Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can craft malicious formulas within the CSV file. When imported and opened with spreadsheet software, these formulas can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's computer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can inject malicious formulas into the comments being exported, which will then be included in the CSV file. When the CSV is imported into spreadsheet software, the malicious formulas are executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability and can be unauthenticated.
