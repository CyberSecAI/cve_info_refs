Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-45183:

**Root Cause:**
* A logic error existed within the App Token endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Privilege Escalation:** A valid app token created by a user could be used to access other app tokens created by the same user, even if those other tokens had higher privileges (e.g., a reader token accessing an administrator token).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker with a low-privilege app token could escalate their privileges within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
* An attacker needs a valid app token to exploit the vulnerability.
* The attack involves sending HTTP web requests to retrieve other app tokens by their ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have a valid app token created by the same user as the token they are trying to access.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability only allowed access to tokens created by the same user, not tokens created by other users.
* The vulnerability affected versions 3.5.2 and earlier, 3.4.6 and earlier, and 2.12.5 and earlier of PowerShell Universal.
* The issue is fixed in versions 3.5.3, 3.4.7, and 2.12.6.
* Mitigation is also possible by revoking affected app tokens, without needing to patch.
