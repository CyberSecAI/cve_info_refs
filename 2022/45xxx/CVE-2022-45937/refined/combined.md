SUMMARY

APOGEE PXC / TALON TC ﬁeld panels (BACnet before V3.5.5 and P2 Ethernet before V2.8.20) contain
multiple vulnerabilities:

• CVE-2022-45937: A privilege management vulnerability that could allow low privilege authenticated

attackers to gain high privilege access.

• CVE-2020-28388: Predictable Initial Sequence Numbers in the TCP/IP Stack of Nucleus RTOS

(real-time operating system) used by the affected products.

• Several vulnerabilities in the DNS (domain name service) implementation of Nucleus RTOS.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

APOGEE PXC Modular and Compact Series devices are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

TALON TC Modular and Compact Series devices are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the TALON Automation System.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15795

The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the names in DNS-
responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a write past the end of an allocated
structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to
execute code in the context of the current process or cause a denial-of-service condition.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27009

The DNS domain name record decompression functionality does not properly validate the pointer
offset values. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a write past the end of an allocated
structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to
execute code in the context of the current process or cause a denial-of-service condition.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27736

The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the null-terminated
name in DNS-responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read past the end
of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this
vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition or leak the read memory.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27737

The DNS response parsing functionality does not properly validate various length and counts of the
records. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read past the end of an allocated
structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to
cause a denial-of-service condition or leak the memory past the allocated structure.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27738

The DNS domain name record decompression functionality does not properly validate the pointer

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28388

Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufﬁciently random
source. As a result, the ISN of current and future TCP connections could be predictable. An attacker
could hijack existing sessions or spoof future ones.
