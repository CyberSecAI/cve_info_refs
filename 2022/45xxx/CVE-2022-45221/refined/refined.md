The provided content describes multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in a "Web-Based Student Clearance System" PHP application.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before embedding it into HTML responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present in the following files and parameters:
    - `/changepassword.php`: `txtold_password`, `txtnew_password`, and `txtconfirm_password` parameters.
    - `/admin/changepassword.php`: `txtold_password`, `txtnew_password`, and `txtconfirm_password` parameters.
    - `/admin/add-admin.php`: `txtusername` parameter.
    - `/admin/add-student.php`: `txtfullname` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application's web pages.
- This could lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web application.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- The malicious JavaScript payload is injected through the vulnerable parameters in the POST data.
- The server reflects the injected payload back in the response, causing the user's browser to execute the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter names and their associated endpoints.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the /changepassword.php endpoints, but they need to be authenticated to exploit the /admin/ endpoints.

The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, including specific vulnerable parameters and proof of concept (PoC) HTTP requests.
