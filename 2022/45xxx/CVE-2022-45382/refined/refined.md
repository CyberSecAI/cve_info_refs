Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-45382:

**CVE-2022-45382: Stored XSS vulnerability in Naginator Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Naginator Plugin does not properly escape the display names of source builds when displaying builds triggered via the Retry action.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the build display names. When a user views the affected page, the malicious script will execute within the user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with the ability to edit build display names (likely through the Item/Configure permission) can insert malicious script code into the display name. The injected script is stored and executed when other users view the affected page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires Item/Configure permission, which enables editing of build display names. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability

**Affected Plugin and Versions:**
*   `naginator` plugin versions 1.18.1 and earlier

**Fixed Plugin Version:**
*  `naginator` plugin version 1.18.2

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is resolved by escaping display names of source builds in Naginator Plugin version 1.18.2.
