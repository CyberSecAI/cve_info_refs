{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The kernel subsystem in kernel_liteos_a has a kernel stack overflow vulnerability when call SysClockGettime.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A kernel stack overflow allows for 4 bytes of padding data from the kernel stack to be copied to user space incorrectly, resulting in a leak.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to information disclosure because kernel stack data is leaked to user space.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `SysClockGettime` system call is made, exposing the vulnerability to any process or application that can trigger that syscall.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to make system calls, usually by executing code on the target device."
