- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing or insufficient CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the vulnerable plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through crafted requests initiated from a different domain than the vulnerable website. An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and induce an authenticated user to trigger it (e.g., by visiting a crafted website).
