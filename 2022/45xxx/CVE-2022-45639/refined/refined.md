{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `fls` tool in The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is vulnerable to OS command injection due to insufficient input sanitization of the `-m` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection",
	  "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the system where the `fls` tool is run.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local: crafted input to fls tool via -m parameter",
       "Remote: If fls is used within a web application that is exposed to external user input"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to pass a crafted string to the `-m` option of the `fls` tool. If executed remotely, the attacker needs to control the input to the web application.",
	"details": "The vulnerability occurs in the tsk_fs_fls() function within the fls_lib.c file, where backticks within the -m parameter are not escaped and are interpreted by the shell as commands. The vulnerability exists in linux systems, specifically where the TSK_WIN32 macro is not defined, and code execution happens via tsk_fs_dir_walk() function call."
