**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Associated Files Plugin fails to properly escape the names of associated files before displaying them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts within the associated file names. These scripts are then executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the associated files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The injected XSS can allow an attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the victim user, such as:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirect the user to a malicious site.
    - Modify page content.
    - Perform actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have "Item/Configure" permission to edit the associated files' names.
- The malicious script is injected through the file name field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a user account with "Item/Configure" permission for a project in Jenkins.
- The attacker needs to be able to set associated files through the plugin.
- The attacker doesn't need any special network privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory explicitly states that this is a stored XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in Associated Files Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier.
- As of the publication of the advisory, there is no fix available for the plugin.
