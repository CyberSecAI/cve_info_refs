      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` page. When processing the `security` parameter of a POST request, the value is directly copied to a local stack variable using `strcpy`, without any bounds checking.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Stack-based buffer overflow",
          "Unsafe use of `strcpy`"
        ],
        "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the return address of the function, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
        "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` page with an overly long `security` parameter.",
		"attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is mentioned as being required in the provided context"
