The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability found in the Church Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `id` parameter in the `/cman/admin/edit_members.php` file. The application directly uses the provided `id` value within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to the lack of input validation and sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database exposure: An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and other application data.
- Database modification: An attacker could modify or delete data from the database, potentially causing application malfunction or data loss.
- Database takeover: An attacker could gain full control of the database server.
- In this specific case, the provided payload allows an attacker to retrieve the database name.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter of a GET request to the `/cman/admin/edit_members.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests and inject SQL payloads into the vulnerable parameter.
