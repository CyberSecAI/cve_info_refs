- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Hero Banner Ultimate WordPress plugin (versions <= 1.3.4) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts that can redirect users, display unwanted advertisements, or execute other HTML payloads when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: This is a web-based vulnerability, likely exploited through a user-supplied input field that is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious actor with the ability to inject code into the vulnerable input field can exploit this vulnerability. The required privilege is 'Contributor'.
