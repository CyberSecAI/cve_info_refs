```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `dvb_frontend_detach()` function was not called in `ttusb_dec_exit_dvb()`, which is called when the device is disconnected. This prevents `dvb_frontend_free()` from being called.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak due to not freeing resources when the device is disconnected.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A memory leak that can be triggered by repeatedly plugging and unplugging the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Repeatedly plugging and unplugging the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have physical access to the device and be able to repeatedly plug and unplug it."
