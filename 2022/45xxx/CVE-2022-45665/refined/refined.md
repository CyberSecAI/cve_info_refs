The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda i22 router firmware.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `formSetCfm` function in the `httpd` module.
- Specifically, the `sub_69F64` function, called by `formSetCfm`, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when handling the `funcpara1` parameter from the `/goform/setcfm` request.
- The `funcpara1` parameter's value is used in `sprintf` without proper length validation into the `s` buffer of size 64 bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow due to unchecked data length passed to `sprintf`.
- The `sub_69F64` function processes the `funcpara1` parameter by splitting it based on a delimiter (determined by the a3 parameter of the function), then use these splitted parts in `sprintf` to fill the local buffer `s`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the httpd process due to the buffer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/setcfm` with an overly long `funcpara1` parameter, exceeding the bounds of the stack buffer `s` in function `sub_69F64`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This would generally require network access to the router's web interface.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda i22 V1.0.0.3(4687).
- The exploit involves sending a long string as the `funcpara1` parameter in the POST request, causing the `sprintf` function to write beyond the allocated buffer.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
