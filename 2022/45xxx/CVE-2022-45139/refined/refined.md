Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) misconfiguration within the web-based management interface of the affected products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CORS Misconfiguration:** The web-based management system does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing requests from unauthorized origins. This is a case of Origin Validation Error (CWE-346).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious third-party server can leverage the CORS misconfiguration to access basic information pages on the vulnerable device's web server. This can lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive device information.
- **Combined Attack Impact:** When combined with CVE-2022-45138 (which allows unauthenticated access to device parameters), the CORS vulnerability could enable further disclosure of device information, such as CPU diagnostics.
- **Limited Confidentiality Impact:** The impact is limited to a small subset of confidentiality as only a limited amount of information is readable via this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Third-party Website:** A malicious actor can host a website that exploits the CORS misconfiguration to send requests to the vulnerable device's web-based management interface.
- **Web Browser:** The victim would need to visit the attacker's malicious web page in their browser for the attack to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web-based management interface of the targeted device.
- **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs to host a web server with malicious content that exploits the CORS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that CVE-2022-45139 is one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting the WAGO web-based management, alongside CVE-2022-45138, CVE-2022-45140, and CVE-2022-45137.
- The advisory provides a mitigation of deactivating the web-based management, restricting network access and not to directly connect the device to the internet.
- The suggested remediation is to update to FW22 Patch 1 or FW 24 or higher.
