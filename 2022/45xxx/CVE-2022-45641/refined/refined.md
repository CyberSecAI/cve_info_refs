The provided content contains information about a buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC6 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` module of the Tenda AC6 router firmware when handling requests to `/goform/formSetMacFilterCfg`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `deviceList` parameter in the `/goform/formSetMacFilterCfg` request is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending a large string as the value for the `deviceList` parameter, it's possible to overwrite memory, including the PC register.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) results in a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the router. It's possible to control the program counter (PC) by padding the `deviceList` parameter with a long string of "A" characters (specifically 144 'A's) followed by the "BBBB" sequence.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This generally implies network access, although depending on the environment this could be from the local network or potentially from the WAN.
- The attacker also needs to know the correct password to pass authentication. The "Cookie: password=eeg1qw" in the PoC implies that authentication is bypassed in testing, but it would be required in real scenarios.
