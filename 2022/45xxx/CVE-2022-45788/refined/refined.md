- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions when a malicious project file is loaded onto the controller.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and loss of confidentiality and integrity of the controller.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the PLC, denial of service, and loss of confidentiality and integrity of the controller.
- **Attack vectors**: Loading a malicious project file onto the controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify a project file and then load this malicious file onto the targeted controller. The attacker needs to have access to the system where the software (e.g., EcoStruxure Control Expert) is running.
