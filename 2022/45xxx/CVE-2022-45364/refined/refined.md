- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force a higher privileged user to perform unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request that the authenticated user unknowingly triggers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.
