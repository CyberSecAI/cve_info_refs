- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `student_login.process.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input. Specifically, the `$id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or prepared statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive information, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. In the provided PoC, the attacker extracts database user information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to `student_login.process.php`. The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `email` parameter of the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `student_login.process.php` endpoint. They also need knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection payload.
