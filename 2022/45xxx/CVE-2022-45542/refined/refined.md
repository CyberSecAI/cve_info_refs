Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the EyouCMS file manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The `filename` parameter in the `Filemanager` module's `edit` action is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This occurs because the input is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
*   This code would then be executed within the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.
*   This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `filename` parameter: `/cms/eyoucms/login.php?m=admin&c=Filemanager&a=edit&filename=li|"><script>alert(1)</script><!--sts_media.htm&activepath=%3Atemplate%3Amobile&lang=cn`
*   The attacker would need to trick a user into visiting this crafted URL, which could be achieved via phishing, social engineering, or by injecting the link elsewhere.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a URL with a malicious XSS payload in the `filename` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user (likely a CMS administrator) to click the malicious link.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges other than that the targeted user be logged into the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable version is EyouCMS V1.6.0-UTF8-SP1 and possibly earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Srpopty, and discovered using Corax.
*   A fix has been released in version 1.6.2.
