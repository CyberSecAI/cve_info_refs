Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-45207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of string interpolation `${}` instead of prepared statements with parameter binding `#{}`, within several SQL queries in the JeecgBoot project. This practice can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The use of `${}` directly embeds user-supplied input into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the following methods were identified as vulnerable:
    *   `queryListWithPermission`
    *  `updateNullByEmptyString`
    *  `selectLogicDeleted`
    *   `queryFilterTableDictInfo`
    *   `queryTableDictItemsByCodeAndFilter`
    *   `queryTableDictTextByKey`
    *   `queryTreeList`
    *   `queryTableDictWithFilter`
    *   `queryAllTableDictItems`
    *   `queryTableDictByKeysAndFilterSql`
*   **Bypass potential security checks**:  The reporter indicated that the `checksql` function used in the project could be easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive data from the database, which could include user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain elevated privileges within the database system.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In certain contexts, SQL injection can allow for execution of system commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through user input that's directly incorporated into the SQL queries via string interpolation using `${}`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to influence the parameters used in the vulnerable SQL queries.
* The attacker needs to have some level of access to the application that triggers the vulnerable queries.
*   A detailed POC was not shared, but the reporter did indicate the `checksql` function was bypassable and that the `x-sign` check made it unclear how to construct a POC.

**Additional Details:**

*   The developer mentioned that some of the dynamic SQL queries were necessary and that a `checksql` method was added for security, but a bypass was noted by the reporter.
*   The issue report was closed after identified vulnerable SQL queries were fixed.
* The fix included replacing `${}` with `#{}`, which uses prepared statements and prevents SQL injection by properly escaping input.

This issue is correctly identified as CVE-2022-45207 due to the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
