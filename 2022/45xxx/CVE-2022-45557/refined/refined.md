The provided content is related to CVE-2022-45557.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application `Left` is vulnerable to XSS and Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to how it handles filenames. Specifically, it renders filenames in a way that allows execution of Javascript code embedded within the filename.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize or escape filenames, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected Javascript uses `require('child_process').exec()` to execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve RCE by crafting a malicious filename. In this case, a calculator application is opened via `open -a /System/Applications/Calculator.app`, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Filename:** The malicious code is injected via a specially crafted filename.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a file with the malicious name and have a user open this file with the vulnerable application, `Left`.
