The provided content relates to CVE-2022-45657.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSetIpMacBind` function within the `httpd` module of the Tenda AC6V1.0 router firmware. This is triggered when handling the `/goform/SetIpMacBind` request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in the `fromSetIpMacBind` function due to insufficient input validation of the `list` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates that sending a specially crafted request with an overly long "list" parameter can cause the router to crash.
- Code execution: By controlling the PC register, it is possible to achieve code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/goform/SetIpMacBind`.
- The `list` parameter within the POST request is used to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. This typically implies the attacker has network access to the device, either locally or remotely if the device is exposed.
- The attacker also needs to know the specific vulnerable endpoint `/goform/SetIpMacBind`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Tenda AC6V1.0 with firmware version V15.03.05.19.
- The PoC provided uses a long string of 'A' characters to overflow the buffer, and by sending a string of 428 'A' characters it's possible to control the PC register.
