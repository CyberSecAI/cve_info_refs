- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Image Map Pro plugin for WordPress versions before 5.6.9 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link that executes an action within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in, privileged user to visit a crafted web page or click a malicious link. The attacker does not need prior access or authentication to the WordPress site, but needs to target an authenticated user.
