{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `dimC_box_read` function in `isomedia/box_code_3gpp.c` allocates memory based on `p->size` but doesn't properly account for the actual data read from the bitstream, leading to a memory leak if the read operation doesn't complete as expected.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak: The allocated memory `str` is not freed under certain conditions, specifically when the loop condition `i < msize` is not met due to insufficient bytes in the bitstream."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially application instability or denial of service if the vulnerability is repeatedly triggered.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted input file. A specially crafted MP4 file can trigger the vulnerable code path, causing the memory leak during parsing.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious MP4 file to be processed by the vulnerable application."
  },
   "additional_information": {
    "details": "The issue was found in the dimC_box_read function in isomedia/box_code_3gpp.c at line 1060. The function allocates a buffer using `gf_malloc` based on the size field of a box, but the read loop can exit prematurely, resulting in the allocated buffer being leaked. The code attempts to read a string from the bitstream, expecting it to be null-terminated. If the input data doesn't contain enough bytes to complete the read and add the null terminator the allocated memory is not released leading to a memory leak.",
    "related_issues": "This issue was initially addressed in #2294 and #2296 but the fix was not perfect and still had a memory leak risk."
