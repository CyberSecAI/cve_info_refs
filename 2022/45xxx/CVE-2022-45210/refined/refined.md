The provided content discusses CVE-2022-45210, a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/sys/user/deleteRecycleBin` endpoint of the JeecgBoot application.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of precompilation in the `sysUserMapper.xml` when handling user IDs for deletion. This allows for direct injection of SQL code through the `userIds` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `/sys/user/deleteRecycleBin` endpoint. Specifically, the `userIds` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or disrupting operations. The provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function, indicating that database information can be exfiltrated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/sys/user/deleteRecycleBin` endpoint by injecting malicious SQL code into the `userIds` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a valid `X-Access-Token`. The provided example shows that a token is needed to access the endpoint, which suggests a low level of privilege is required, but not that it is available to unauthenticated users.
