Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-45413:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Firefox for Android handles intent URLs, specifically the `S.browser_fallback_url` parameter. When an intent URL fails to resolve to an application, the browser uses this parameter to load a fallback URL. The issue is that when loading this fallback URL, the browser doesn't properly enforce SameSite cookie policies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SameSite Cookie Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is a bypass of the `SameSite=Strict` cookie policy, and also a bypass of the `SameSite=Lax` cookie policy as intent redirects are confirmed to work. This policy is designed to prevent cookies from being sent in cross-site requests, thus mitigating CSRF attacks.
*   **Improper URL Loading Flags:** The `loadUrl` call within the Android Components was not setting the correct flags (`external()`) which would have prevented the vulnerability. This allowed the fallback URL to be loaded with the same flags as a same-site request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can force a user's browser to send `SameSite=Strict` cookies to a cross-site origin without user interaction. This could allow the attacker to:
*   **CSRF Attacks:** Perform actions on behalf of the user on a vulnerable website if they have an active session, using cookies that should have been protected.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Potentially gain access to the user's session by leveraging the leaked cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Intent URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious intent URL with an invalid application package and a controlled `S.browser_fallback_url` pointing to a URL on the attacker's server or controlled site.
*   **User Redirection:** The attacker redirects the user (e.g., via a link or a malicious website) to the malicious intent URL.
*   **Fallback URL Trigger:** Firefox fails to resolve the intent, causing it to load the attacker-controlled fallback URL, which receives the victim's `SameSite=Strict` cookies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to create malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct the malicious intent URL.
*   **Ability to host a server:** The attacker needs a server to receive the cross-site cookies.
*   **User Interaction (indirect):** The user must be tricked into visiting the malicious intent URL.

**Additional details:**
*   **Affected Platform:** This vulnerability is specific to Firefox for Android.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involved updating the Android Components to correctly set the `external()` load flag when handling fallback URLs from intent URLs.
*   **Severity:**  The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity.
*   **Specific parameter used:** `S.browser_fallback_url`
*   **Affected cookie security:** `SameSite=Strict` and `SameSite=Lax` cookies
