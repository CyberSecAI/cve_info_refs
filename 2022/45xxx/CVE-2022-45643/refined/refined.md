Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `httpd` module of the Tenda AC6 router firmware. This occurs when handling the `/goform/addWifiMacFilter` request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `deviceId` parameter within the `addWifiMacFilter` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates sending an excessively long string for the `deviceId` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided PoC is specifically noted to result in a DoS. Sending an overly long string in the `deviceId` parameter can likely crash the `httpd` process, making the router unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/addWifiMacFilter` endpoint.
- **`deviceId` parameter:** The `deviceId` parameter in the POST request is the specific vector through which the buffer overflow is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Tenda router's web interface, meaning they need to be on the same network or have the ability to reach the router's IP address.

**Additional details:**
- The content specifies the affected firmware version as Tenda AC6V1.0 V15.03.05.19.
- The PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a very long string of "A" characters for `deviceId` and `wifi_chkHz`.
- The vulnerability is located in the `httpd` module.
- The vulnerability occurs while handling requests to the `/goform/addWifiMacFilter` page
