Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Tenda AC6V1.0 router firmware version V15.03.05.19 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because the `/goform/SysToolReboot` endpoint does not have proper CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of CSRF protection on the `/goform/SysToolReboot` endpoint. This allows an attacker to initiate a reboot of the router without the user's consent, provided the user is logged into the router's admin panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can force a router reboot, disrupting network connectivity for connected users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request sent to the `/goform/SysToolReboot` endpoint. This request can be triggered by the victim's browser without their knowledge if they are logged into the router's administration interface.
- The attacker can embed the malicious request in a webpage or email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to convince a logged-in user to visit a malicious webpage or open an email containing the malicious request.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same local network.
- The attacker does not require any credentials but relies on the user being authenticated to the router.

**Additional Details**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) HTTP GET request, which demonstrates how the attack works. It shows that a simple GET request to the vulnerable endpoint can initiate a reboot.
- The vulnerable firmware version is explicitly stated.
- The content includes images that provide further visual context for the vulnerability, showcasing the vulnerable interface.
