{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `strcat` function is used to append the account to a buffer without performing a size check, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of size check when using `strcat`."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The router crashes, and it is possible to achieve remote code execution and obtain a root shell by crafting a suitable exploit.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/addUserName` endpoint with an overly large `account` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device. The provided PoC assumes the attacker is on the same network as the router or has a way to reach the router's web interface."
