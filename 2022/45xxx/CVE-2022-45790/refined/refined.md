Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of rate limiting in the FINS protocol used by Omron CJ/CS/CP series programmable logic controllers. Specifically, there is no restriction on the number of password guesses allowed when trying to access password-protected memory regions. This allows for brute-force attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Control of Interaction Frequency (CWE-799):** The core weakness is the absence of rate limiting for password attempts, making the system susceptible to brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass password protection and gain access to sensitive information stored in the controller's memory. This can lead to unauthorized access to configuration data, operational parameters, and potentially other proprietary information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely, as it utilizes the FINS protocol over the network.
*   **Brute-Force Attack:** Attackers can repeatedly attempt to guess passwords for protected memory regions due to the lack of rate limiting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected Omron PLC devices.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication, as the attack focuses on guessing the password for memory access.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The vulnerability has a low attack complexity, indicating that exploiting it doesn't require specialized skills or tools.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects multiple Omron PLC series, including CJ, CS, and CP series, and specific models and versions are listed.
*   **Mitigation:**  Omron recommends updating to specific firmware versions to remediate the vulnerability. Additionally, they suggest general security practices such as anti-virus protection, restricting network access, using firewalls and VPNs, and enforcing strong passwords.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
