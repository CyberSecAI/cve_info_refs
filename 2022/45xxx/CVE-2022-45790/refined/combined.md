**3.2.1 [IMPROPER CONTROL OF INTERACTION FREQUENCY CWE-799](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/799.html)**

Omron CJ/CS/CP series programmable logic controllers use the FINS protocol, which is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. The controllers do not enforce any rate limit on password guesses to password-protected memory regions.

[CVE-2022-45790](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-45790) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Japan

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Reid Wightman of Dragos reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Omron recommends users update their products as soon as possible. Updated versions can be obtained by contacting [Omron's Customer Care Team](https://industrial.omron.us/en/services-and-support/customer-care).

* CJ2H-CPU\*\*(-EIP): Update to version 1.5
* CJ2M-CPU\*\*: Update to version 2.1
* CS1H/G-CPU\*\* H、CJ1G-CPU\*\* P: Update to version 4.1
* CS1D-CPU\*\* H / -CPU\*\* P: Update to version 1.4
* CS1D-CPU\*\* S: Update to version 2.1
* CP1E-E / -N: Update to version 1.3

Please see [Omron's Advisory](https://www.fa.omron.co.jp/product/security/assets/pdf/en/OMSR-2023-010_en.pdf) for more information.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.

in  the  FINS  protocol  between  the  CS/CJ/CP-series  Programable  Controllers,  the  products

may be gain unauthorized access.

■Potential threats and impacts

      An attacker may use the vulnerabilities to unprotect password-protected memory areas and

gain information in the controller product unauthorizedly.

■CVSS Scores

    Improper Control of Interaction Frequency (CWE-799)

    CVE-2022-45790

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N Base Score 7.5

■Mitigations and Protections

OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk

of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

1. Anti-virus protection

Protect any PC with access to the control system against malware and ensure installation

and maintenance of up-to-date commercial grade anti-virus software protection.

    2. Security measures to prevent unauthorized access

-  Minimize  connection  of  control  systems  and  equipment  to  open  networks,  so  that

untrusted devices will be unable to access them.

-  Implement  firewalls  (by  shutting  down  unused  communications  ports,  limiting

communications hosts) and isolate them from the IT network.

- Use a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access to control systems and equipment.

No. OMSR-2023-010_en (  3  /  4  )

- Use strong passwords and change them frequently.

- Install physical controls so that only authorized personnel can access control systems

and equipment.

- Scan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting them

to systems and devices.

- Enforce multifactor authentication to all devices with remote access to control systems

and equipment whenever possible.

3. Data input and output protection

Validation  processing  such  as  backup  and  range  check  to  cope  with  unintentional

modification of input/output data to control systems and devices.

4. Data recovery

        Periodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.
