Hide comment

A side comment (not related to the test failure):

why is the private method of a class altering the global object? The content of this method doesn't use the actual object it is called upon (self) and yet this method is called as part of initialization of the AirflowAppBuilder object.

Does the builder *depends* on the old behavior of `fab_sec_views.get_safe_redirect` before initialization complete? If so, could you please leave a comment about that? If not, is the AppBuilder (which focuses on building "app" object) the right place to perform this substitution? Maybe it would be better to put static part of the initialization in a new dedicated file?
