Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an open redirect issue within the `/login` endpoint of the Apache Airflow webserver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The `/login` endpoint was not properly validating the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to potentially redirect users to arbitrary malicious websites after a successful login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to a phishing page disguised as a legitimate login or other Airflow page. This could lead to the theft of user credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect to a page hosting malware.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker could manipulate the redirect to exploit user trust and lead to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL to the `/login` endpoint with a manipulated `next_url` parameter containing the attacker's redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with an attacker-controlled redirect target.
- No special privileges or authentication is necessary.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the FAB url filtering function with Airflow's own implementation, ensuring consistency between FAB and Airflow routes.
- The fix was implemented in commit `b33d22c` and cherry-picked into `f0f67e8`.
- The issue was reported by Bugra Eskici.
- The fix was released as part of Airflow 2.4.3.
