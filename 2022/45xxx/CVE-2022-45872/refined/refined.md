  "content": "The provided content describes a vulnerability found in iTerm2's SSH integration feature, specifically versions 3.5.6 through 3.5.10 and any related beta versions.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: A bug in the SSH integration feature caused input and output to be logged to a file on the remote host.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The primary vulnerability is the unintentional logging of SSH session input and output to /tmp/framer.txt on the remote host. This file might be readable by other users on the remote system.\n\nImpact of exploitation: The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that sensitive information, including input and output data from SSH sessions, may be exposed to unauthorized users on the remote host. This could lead to information disclosure or further exploitation.\n\nAttack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through the use of the it2ssh command or by configuring a profile to use SSH with \"SSH Integration\" enabled and a remote host that has Python 3.7 or later installed.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would require access to the remote host to read the /tmp/framer.txt file to access logged data. They do not need to be the user who initiated the SSH session but just have file read access.",
