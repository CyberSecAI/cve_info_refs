- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Paytm Payment Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, which allows a malicious actor to make requests to arbitrary domains.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could potentially use this vulnerability to cause a website to make requests to an attacker-controlled server. This could allow an attacker to find sensitive information from other services running on the system or conduct other malicious activities by interacting with internal services through the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors**:  A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin.
