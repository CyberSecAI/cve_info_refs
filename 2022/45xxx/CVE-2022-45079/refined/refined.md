- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Loginizer WordPress plugin <= 1.7.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will perform an unwanted action on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website to trigger the forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
