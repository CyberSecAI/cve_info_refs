- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `/goform/L7Im` page due to the use of `sprintf` without a size check when concatenating user-supplied input, which in this case comes from the `page` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to lack of size validation during string concatenation using `sprintf`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a crash of the router. An attacker could potentially write an exploit to gain a root shell on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/L7Im` endpoint with an overly long `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. In this case, the PoC targets a device at `192.168.10.103`, implying the attacker is on the same network, or has access to the device through a forward facing port. The attacker also needs to be able to authenticate to the router with valid credentials, in this case, the default "admin/admin" is used.
