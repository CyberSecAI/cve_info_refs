{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The page will be spliced into s by sprintf without size check.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow vulnerability due to lack of size check in sprintf when processing the 'page' parameter in the `/goform/NatStaticSetting` page.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The router crashes, potentially leading to the ability to write an exploit to get a root shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/NatStaticSetting` page with a 'page' parameter exceeding the buffer size.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router and have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter. Authentication as admin is required."
