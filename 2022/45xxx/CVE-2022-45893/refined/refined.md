The provided content is related to CVE-2022-45893.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the cookie and session management of the web application. Specifically, the 'ON' cookie, which stores user session information, can be manipulated by users with low privileges to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure session management: The 'ON' cookie is not properly validated and can be easily modified.
- Authentication bypass: By changing the value of the 'ON' cookie, users can gain access to administrative features and other user accounts.
- Low cookie entropy: The cookie's format allows for easy brute-forcing, making it easier for attackers to guess valid cookie values.
- Persistent cookies: The 'ON' cookie does not change between sessions, granting attackers persistent access once a valid cookie is obtained.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account takeover: Attackers can gain access to administrative accounts and other user accounts by obtaining their valid 'ON' cookies, leading to complete control of those accounts.
- Privilege escalation: Low-privileged users can gain access to administrative and privileged features by manipulating the 'ON' cookie, bypassing authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cookie manipulation: Attackers modify the 'ON' cookie value using browser developer tools or by intercepting and modifying requests.
- Brute-forcing: Due to the low entropy of the cookie, attackers can guess valid cookie values using brute force techniques.
- Information disclosure: As described in another vulnerability, leaked cookie values can be found within responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access: While a bypass can be achieved via sharing links, the user has to be at least a 'Member' or 'Bypass' user.
- Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests or use browser developer tools.
- No special network access requirements are specified in the provided document.
