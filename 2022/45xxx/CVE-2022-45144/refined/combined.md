# usd-2022-0048 | Tracim 4.4.2 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting

**Advisory ID**: usd-2022-0048
**Affected Product**: Tracim
**Affected Version**: 4.4.2 (probably others too)
**Vulnerability Type**: Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
**Security Risk**: High
**Vendor URL**: <https://tracim.fr>
**Vendor Acknowledged Vulnerability**: Yes
**Vendor Status**: Fixed
**CVE ID**: CVE-2022-45144
**CVE Link:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45144>

*The following behavior was reported to Tracim in November 2022. After several contact attempts, the usd AG Responsible Disclosure Team did not receive any response. In order to inform the users of Tracim about the unresolved vulnerability, the advisory was published in accordance with our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://herolab.usd.de/responsible-disclosure/).*

*Edit 07-10-2024:*

*The Tracim team informed us that this vulnerability is fixed in version 4.11.1. They thanked us for our feedback and mentioned that since then their internal processes for handling vulnerability disclosures have been improved.*

### Description

Tracim is a collaborative platform software that allows teams to share and work on various types of data and documents. The application allows uploads of HTML files, which leads to a stored Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

Additionally to the stored XSS vulnerability, the impact can be increased by using a HTML injection in the comments feature. This endpoint usually blocks XSS attempts using a CSP, which can be bypassed. The tested version was Tracim 4.4.2.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The application allows to upload HTML files, which can be viewed in "raw" using a link similar to the one below:

http://localhost:8080/api/workspaces/1/files/19/raw/test.html

This upload functionality makes the application vulnerable to a stored XSS, because the uploaded file is rendered in the context of the application.

Tracim implements the following CSP:

Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'unsafe-eval' 'nonce-67c3972badf9a5c68a68fb5b107ab5f0ce1c8d0b15e6b9342d68b53f56cd4238'; style-src 'unsafe-inline' 'self'; connect-src 'self'; font-src data: blob: \*; img-src data: blob: \*; media-src data: blob: \*; frame-src \* 'self'; object-src 'none'; default-src 'self'

To attack more users from inside the application one needs to bypass the CSP and embed the uploaded file in a commonly visited place. Tracim allows injection of HTML into a comment. The endpoint uses a CSP to block XSS attempts. However, the CSP can be bypassed using our uploaded HTML file as an iframe source.

POST /api/workspaces/1/contents/22/comments HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:103.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/103.0

Origin: http://localhost:8080

[...]

{"raw\_content":"<iframe src=\"http://localhost:8080/api/workspaces/1/files/19/raw/test.html\"></iframe>","content\_namespace":"publication"}

### Fix

It is recommended to treat all input on the website as potentially dangerous. Hence, all output that is dynamically generated based on user-controlled data should be encoded according to its context. The majority of programming languages support standard procedures for encoding meta characters. Also it is recommended to restrict the allowed file types in the file upload function.

Users of Tracim can upgrade to version 4.11.1.

### About usd Security Advisories

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/icon-hero.png "icon-hero")

In order to protect businesses against hackers and criminals, we always have to keep our skills and knowledge up to date. Thus, security research is just as important for our work as is building up a security community to promote the exchange of knowledge. After all, more security can only be achieved if many individuals take on the task.

Our [CST Academy](https://www.usd.de/en/cst-academy/) and our [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) are essential parts of our security mission. We share the knowledge we gain in our practical work and our research through training courses and publications. In this context, the [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) publishes a series of papers on new vulnerabilities and current security issues.

Always for the sake of our mission: „more security.“

[to usd AG](https://www.usd.de/)

In accordance with usd AG’s [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/en/responsible-disclosure/), all vendors have been notified of the existence of these vulnerabilities.
