{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A deadlock occurs in systemd-coredump when processing a crash with a long backtrace due to a pipe buffer overflow when transferring data from the forked process to the parent.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The pipe used for transferring backtrace data has a limited buffer size.",
      "The child process attempts to write the entire backtrace at once, without checking the pipe's capacity.",
      "The parent process waits for the child to exit before reading the data from the pipe, leading to a deadlock when the pipe is full."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service by triggering a crash with a long backtrace, leading to a deadlock in systemd-coredump and preventing further core dump processing.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local user can trigger a crash with a long backtrace by recursively calling a function and placing the executable in deeply nested directories.",
       "The vulnerability is triggered when the systemd-coredump service attempts to process the generated coredump."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "Local user access is required to execute the vulnerable program. No special privileges other than ability to execute a program are required for the local user to trigger the crash and cause the deadlock."
