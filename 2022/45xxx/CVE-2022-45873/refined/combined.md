Not a big fan of removing the config flag, but ok. But this needs test updates - new helpers need unit tests, and TEST-75 needs adjustments and coverage for the monitor command.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Looks nice. I didn't review the monitor output in detail. [@surajkrishnan14](https://github.com/surajkrishnan14) can you review those parts to make sure that the output looks OK?

| I also added some better support for following CNAME chains: each element in the chain will show up as a separate query. But each query will also contain the questions of previous elements of the chain in a new `collectedQuestions` metadata field. This means we will report for each element of the chain the results once we have it, but we'll also tell you how we came there, and the final answer will give you complete information about the chain we followed. |

| It's a long story but if you haven't noticed I always report systemd bugs like that publicly. I think it started when I was told that fuzzing stuff shouldn't be sent to that mailing list for some reason. I didn't think it was a good idea but basically when I opened PRs like [#10200](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/10200) all those overflows were immediately public. I didn't request CVEs though because at the time I was able to backport those fixes without that. |

| Opening github bug reports for issues of any kind is one thing, and most of the times it's fine to do so, especially for the fuzzing stuff. Contacting MITRE to ask for a CVE to be assigned, bypassing the established security process and without consulting anybody else, is very much a different matter altogether. |

| especially for the fuzzing stuff  Fuzzing stuff is exactly what should be covered by the security process. When infinite loops like [86b06c6](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/86b06c666be8b7afb45541d35aa4d0ecb38056d1) can be triggered in dhcp-client on receiving some weird packets it should go through that process. And if projects agree I of course participate in CVD. `dbus` is a great example where issues like that are taken seriously: <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2022/q4/7>  Contacting MITRE to ask for a CVE to be assigned  Well, what else should I do? Let's revisit the policy of not sending fuzzing stuff to that mailing list. I would be more than happy. |

| I did contact MITRE and sent links to this thread and [#25518](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/25518) a few hours ago and for now "NOTE: there is some debate about the security relevance of this report because there are zero subscribers by default." ended up in some other CVE. I think it should be fixed soon. I also put use-after-frees, infinite loops and stuff like that that can be triggered remotely on hold because based on [#25518 (comment)](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/25518#issuecomment-1327307923) it seems if a feature like `mdns` happens to be off by default it doesn't matter whether use-after-frees can be triggered on receiving packets when it's on or something like that. I don't agree with that but I don't want to annoy anyone either. |

In that particular case there is a reachable assertion in systemd-resolved that can be triggered by any local user by writing crafted messages to that world-writable socket. Restart doesn't help much obviously because it can be wrapped in a loop (and I frankly have no idea why so much trust is put in "restart" because if stuff is crashed fast enough it gets rate-limited by systemd <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#StartLimitIntervalSec=interval>). I've just checked and Debian Stable still ships resolved where that and a bunch of other local and not-so-local issues are present. The actual Debian security team tracks issues like that (for example [avahi/avahi#338](https://github.com/avahi/avahi/issues/338)). I'm a bit conflicted about being specific about how to trigger various memory corruptions but my understanding is that it should be fine because apparently by the systemd security logic to trigger something in, say, dhcp-server root should enable it somehow so in the end it's downplayed to something requiring user-interaction with the highest privileges so there should be no harm in full public disclosure. |

On my machine, generating the crash takes 5 seconds. So if it timed out, either something is wrong with the patch, or it wasn't applied properly, or there's some other bug. I'll test my patch again here.  Edit: yeah, it seems to work fine here.  ``` $ journalctl -b _PID=2667772 -o cat | head  Process 2667524 (3) of user 1000 dumped core.

`[coredump: avoid deadlock when passing processed backtrace data](/systemd/systemd/pull/25055/commits/076b807be472630692c5348c60d0c2b7b28ad437 "coredump: avoid deadlock when passing processed backtrace data

We would deadlock when passing the data back from the forked-off process that
was doing backtrace generation back to the coredump parent. This is because we
fork the child and wait for it to exit. The child tries to write too much data
to the output pipe, and and after the first 64k blocks on the parent because
the pipe is full. The bug surfaced in Fedora because of a combination of four
factors:
- 87707784c70dc9894ec613df0a6e75e732a362a3 was backported to v251.5, which
  allowed coredump processing to be successful.
- 1a0281a3ebf4f8c16d40aa9e63103f16cd23bb2a was NOT backported, so the output
  was very verbose.
- Fedora has the ELF package metadata available, so a lot of output can be
  generated. Most other distros just don't have the information.
- gnome-calendar crashes and has a bazillion modules and 69596 bytes of output
  are generated for it.

Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2135778.

The code is changed to try to write data opportunistically. If we get partial
information, that is still logged. In is generally better to log partial
backtrace information than nothing at all.")`

| Hmm, usually when reading output from a child we wait for EOF on that before waiting for the exit code of the child. Here it is done the other way round, which is the bug, no? |

| Hmm, usually when reading output from a child we wait for EOF on that before waiting for the exit code of the child. Here it is done the other way round, which is the bug, no?  I considered that too. We could read and accumulate input from the child until EOF. But that'd make the receiving side more complicated, because it'd need to grow a buffer, do a loop, and so on. But realistically, I don't think this is useful. The child generates the whole string first, so it knows how big it is, and can size the pipe appropriately. And also, the output should not be arbitrarily long. After all, we're going to stuff this in the journal, and we don't want to put a million lines in the message. So a more generic transfer mechanism would be more complicated but it wouldn't really give us any gains. |

| hmm, one question: maybe the transfer mechanism should not actually be a pipe, but a memfd? a memfd can auto-grow and we wouldn't be subject to pipe size limits? i.e. instead of a pipe, just allocate a memfd, and pass it to the child? child writes its stuff there. afterwards we seek back to the front and read it?  I think the code would be more robust and even simpler? |

| Centos CI (CentOS Stream 8) is TEST-15-DROPIN, i.e. [#25060](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/25060). Not related.  Yes, but it could introduce new bugs that we aren't aware of - post-rc2 is late, surely it can wait a couple of weeks till after the next release?  Yep. I think we should merge this. Memfd might be nicer, but it'll likely touch a lot of code and has higher potential for regressions. |

| so I tried a systemd with this patch on a gnome-calendar crash, and still didn't get a coredump, probably because: Oct 18 18:29:21 fedora systemd[1]: systemd-coredump@0-2842-0.service: Failed with result 'timeout'.  On my machine, generating the crash takes 5 seconds. So if it timed out, either something is wrong with the patch, or it wasn't applied properly, or there's some other bug. I'll test my patch again here.  Edit: yeah, it seems to work fine here.  ``` $ journalctl -b _PID=2667772 -o cat | head  Process 2667524 (3) of user 1000 dumped core.  Module linux-vdso.so.1 with build-id b21929a49b68b52a4059932eb797eb7182e48f08 Module libopensc.so.8 with build-id 7e70dbbc60cc7358472bcd2a198f1d548af8ab62 Metadata for module libopensc.so.8 owned by FDO found: { 	"type" : "rpm", 	"name" : "opensc", 	"version" : "0.22.0-7.fc37", 	"architecture" : "x86_64", 	"osCpe" : "cpe:/o:fedoraproject:fedora:37" $ journalctl -b _PID=2667772 -o cat | wc  -c 69644  ```  Hmm, that's odd. Note I did a build of the systemd from F37, so 251, with the patch backported. But yeah, then all I did was make gnome-calendar crash and wait. I did do it in a VM with 2G of RAM, so maybe that was a problem... |

| Just to make it easier to fill out some form I'll leave a script bringing down `systemd-coredump` on Fedora 36 with `systemd-250.8` (as any local user) here. Combined with [#24139](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/24139) it can be used to totally hide any weird activity where segfaults, coredumps and stuff like that are involved. The idea is to crash a binary calling the same function recursively and put it in a deeply nested directory to make its backtrace large enough to trigger the deadlock. It's run 16 times because of   [systemd/units/systemd-coredump.socket](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/09cd639a59fec13d80ac8fce2d671d088d8cca9f/units/systemd-coredump.socket#L21)  Line 21 in [09cd639](/systemd/systemd/commit/09cd639a59fec13d80ac8fce2d671d088d8cca9f)   |  | MaxConnections=16 | | --- | --- |      ``` #!/bin/bash set -ex  ulimit -c unlimited  d=$(mktemp -d) pushd "$d"  cat <<'EOL' >hey.c void f() { f(); } int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {     f();     return 0; } EOL  gcc hey.c  a=$(perl -e 'print "A" x 255') for i in {1..10}; do     mkdir "$a"     mv a.out "$a"     cd "$a" done  for i in {1..16}; do     ./a.out & done ``` |

Parsing objects is risky as data could be malformed or malicious,
so avoid doing that from the main systemd-coredump process and
instead fork another process, and set it to avoid generating
core files itself.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-ef4f57b072
2022-12-31 01:16:00.044279
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : systemd
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 250.9
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>
Summary : System and Service Manager
Description :
systemd is a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest
of the system. It provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket
and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of
daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount
and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based
service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a
replacement for sysvinit. Other parts of this package are a logging daemon,
utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname, date, locale,
maintain a list of logged-in users, system accounts, runtime directories and
settings, and a logging daemons.

This package was built from the 250.9-stable branch of systemd.

## Description

systemd 250 and 251 allows local users to achieve a systemd-coredump deadlock by triggering a crash that has a long backtrace. This occurs in parse\_elf\_object in shared/elf-util.c. The exploitation methodology is to crash a binary calling the same function recursively, and put it in a deeply nested directory to make its backtrace large enough to cause the deadlock. This must be done 16 times when MaxConnections=16 is set for the systemd/units/systemd-coredump.socket file.

coredump: avoid deadlock when passing processed backtrace data

```
We would deadlock when passing the data back from the forked-off process that
was doing backtrace generation back to the coredump parent. This is because we
fork the child and wait for it to exit. The child tries to write too much data
to the output pipe, and and after the first 64k blocks on the parent because
the pipe is full. The bug surfaced in Fedora because of a combination of four
factors:
- [8770778](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/87707784c70dc9894ec613df0a6e75e732a362a3) was backported to v251.5, which
  allowed coredump processing to be successful.
- [1a0281a](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/1a0281a3ebf4f8c16d40aa9e63103f16cd23bb2a) was NOT backported, so the output
  was very verbose.
- Fedora has the ELF package metadata available, so a lot of output can be
  generated. Most other distros just don't have the information.
- gnome-calendar crashes and has a bazillion modules and 69596 bytes of output
  are generated for it.

Fixes <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2135778>.

The code is changed to try to write data opportunistically. If we get partial
information, that is still logged. In is generally better to log partial
backtrace information than nothing at all.
