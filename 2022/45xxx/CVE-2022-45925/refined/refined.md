{
  "CVE-2022-45925": {
    "Root cause": "The `xmlexport` action accepts the `requestContext` parameter and the `transform` parameter in combination with `stylesheet`, allowing for information disclosure and NTLM hash capture respectively.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "NTLM hash capture"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain access to sensitive information such as HTTP headers and CGI variables. An attacker can also capture the NTLM hash of the user running the ContentServer.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Sending a crafted GET request to the `/cs.exe` endpoint with the `requestContext` parameter",
        "Sending a crafted GET request to the `/cs.exe` endpoint with the `transform` and `stylesheet` parameters specifying a network share path."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They would also need to be able to set up a network share for NTLM capture."
