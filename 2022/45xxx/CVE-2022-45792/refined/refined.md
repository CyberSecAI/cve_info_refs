- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Memory protection mechanisms are susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate memory protection allows attackers to bypass security measures through brute-force techniques.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially bypass security measures, which could lead to unauthorized access and/or modification of data, or control of the affected devices (PLCs). The CVSSv3 score indicates a high impact on integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) meaning it can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges are required (PR:N), which means anyone on the network may exploit it. The attack requires low attack complexity (AC:L).
