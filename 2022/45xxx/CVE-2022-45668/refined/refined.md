- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Tenda i22 router's `/goform/SysToolReboot` page lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trigger a reboot through a crafted request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can cause the router to reboot, leading to denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by tricking a user into loading a malicious web page that makes a request to the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/SysToolReboot`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to load a web page they control, typically by sending a link via email or other messaging platform. The user must have an active session with the vulnerable device.
