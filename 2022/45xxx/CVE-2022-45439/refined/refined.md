Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-45439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the cleartext storage of a pair of spare WiFi credentials within the configuration file of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 CPE device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage:**  The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive WiFi credentials in an unencrypted format within a configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local unauthenticated attacker who can obtain the configuration file from the device (likely through another vulnerability) can use these cleartext credentials to access the WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) service, gaining unauthorized network access.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack vector involves a local, unauthenticated attacker gaining access to the device's configuration file through exploitation of another vulnerability, which is not specified in this advisory but is mentioned as a pre-requisite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be in a local position to exploit another vulnerability that grants access to the device's configuration file.
-   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to access the configuration file, but will likely need local access to the device to exploit another vulnerability that would allow configuration extraction.
