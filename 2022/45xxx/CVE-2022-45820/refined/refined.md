Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the authenticated SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-45820) in the LearnPress plugin:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-controlled input within the `learn_press_recent_courses` and `learn_press_featured_courses` shortcodes.
- Specifically, the `order` and `order_by` parameters within these shortcodes are directly inserted into SQL queries without sufficient filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where malicious SQL code can be injected through the shortcode parameters.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the input received from the shortcode attributes before incorporating them into the database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    - **Data theft:** Sensitive information could be extracted from the database.
    - **Data modification:** Data within the database could be altered or deleted.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker might gain unauthorized administrative access by modifying user credentials.
    - **Denial of Service:** The database server could be overloaded, causing service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `order` and `order_by` attributes of the `learn_press_recent_courses` and `learn_press_featured_courses` shortcodes.
- **WordPress Post Content:**  Attackers can inject these shortcodes in drafted posts or pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role or higher to insert shortcodes into posts. This means an unauthenticated user cannot trigger this SQL injection.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode Attributes:** The attacker needs to know the specific shortcodes and their vulnerable attributes.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `get_recent_courses` and `get_featured_courses` functions.
- The `order` and `order_by` parameters are inserted directly into the `ORDER BY` clause of the SQL queries.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding sanitization and validation to the order and order_by parameters.
