- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Formidable Forms plugin for WordPress lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF, which allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could lead to a malicious actor forcing a logged-in administrator or other privileged user to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact would depend on the vulnerable actions within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection. This request would be triggered by a logged-in user, without their knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into triggering a crafted request. This could be achieved by social engineering or by embedding malicious links on websites or emails. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the target application.
