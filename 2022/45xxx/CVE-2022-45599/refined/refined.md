Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the use of loose comparison (`==`) instead of strict comparison (`===`) in the `login.php` script of the Aztech WMB250AC Wireless Mesh Routers' web interface when authenticating the admin user's password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **PHP Type Juggling:** The loose comparison allows PHP to perform type coercion during comparison. This means that when comparing a string starting with `0e` followed by numbers (which PHP might interpret as a scientific notation equal to 0) to the MD5 hash of a specific password which could also be interpreted by PHP as 0, the comparison evaluates to true, bypassing the actual password check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the router's administrative interface without knowing the actual admin password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface (Port 80):** The vulnerability is exposed through the login page (`login.php`) accessible via the web interface on port 80.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of this specific type juggling vulnerability.
- **Access to "Magic Hashes":** The attacker needs to have a list of plaintext passwords and their MD5 hashes that are succeptible to this type of attack (specifically those which are represented by `0e` followed by numbers).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the 2020 release firmware (`topaz-linux.lzma.img`) of the Aztech WMB250AC Wireless Mesh Routers.
- The reported was made on 7th June 2022 to Aztech but without any response until 21st February 2023.
- The vulnerability requires that the admin user's password, when MD5 hashed, starts with `0e` followed by numbers.
- The vulnerability has low probability of success, due to the conditions required for exploitation.
- The content also includes screenshots demonstrating the vulnerable code, and references to "magic hashes".
