Subject: [vs] heimdal: CVE-2022-45142: signature validation failure

Hi,

I am hereby publishing a vulnerability in heimdal backports by attaching
the exact mail sent to distros@...openwall.org last week.

Subject: [vs] heimdal: CVE-2022-45142: signature validation failure

(Resent with proper subject tag)

CVE-2022-3437 was a vulnerability affecting heimdal and samba. It was
fixed in both places. The fix included changing memcmp to be constant
time and a workaround for a compiler bug by adding "!= 0" comparisons to
the result of memcmp. When these patches were backported to the
heimdal-7.7.1 and heimdal-7.8.0 branches (and possibly other branches) a
logic inversion sneaked in causing the validation of message integrity
codes in gssapi/arcfour to be inverted.

This vulnerability does not affect samba nor the main heimdal branch and
only applies to backports. At least the 7.7.1 and 7.8.0 branches are
affected. CVE-2022-45142 has been assigned. All releases of Debian are
affected. At least one release of Fedora and Ubuntu are affected.

From: Helmut Grohne <helmut@...divi.de>
Subject: [PATCH v3] CVE-2022-45142: gsskrb5: fix accidental logic inversions

The referenced commit attempted to fix miscompilations with gcc-9 and
gcc-10 by changing `memcmp(...)` to `memcmp(...) != 0`. Unfortunately,
it also inverted the result of the comparison in two occasions. This
inversion happened during backporting the patch to 7.7.1 and 7.8.0.
