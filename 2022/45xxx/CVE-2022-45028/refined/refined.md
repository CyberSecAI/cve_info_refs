```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The username field of a POST request to /cgi-bin/login.ha does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious XSS payload.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they navigate to the /cgi-bin/logs.ha page. This can be used to perform actions such as changing the account password for the web interface administrator or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to /cgi-bin/login.ha with a malicious XSS payload in the username field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and able to send HTTP requests to it. Authentication is not required to inject the payload."
