- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious requests that target the vulnerable plugin's actions and tricking an authenticated user into executing those requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking on a malicious link or loading a malicious page that executes the crafted request.
