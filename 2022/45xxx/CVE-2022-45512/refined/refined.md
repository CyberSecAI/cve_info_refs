Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stack overflow

**Root cause:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `/goform/SafeEmailFilter` page of the Tenda W30E router's firmware.
- The `sprintf` function is used to concatenate data without any size checks.
- Specifically, the `page` parameter is concatenated into string `s` via `sprintf`. The lack of size validation leads to buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of size validation when using `sprintf`.
- Insecure string handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Router crashes.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution by crafting an exploit to overwrite return addresses.
- Possibility of gaining a root shell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/SafeEmailFilter` with an overly large `page` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires network access to the router's web interface (typically LAN).
- Must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.
- The provided PoC uses default credentials ("admin:admin").
