Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to manipulate hop-by-hop headers in HTTP requests. Specifically, by marking certain headers as hop-by-hop, an attacker can prevent Varnish Cache servers from forwarding critical headers like `Content-Length` and `Host` to the backend server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Request Smuggling:** The core issue is request smuggling, where an attacker can manipulate the interpretation of HTTP messages by intermediaries (Varnish Cache), leading to a discrepancy in how requests are processed.
-   **Hop-by-hop Header Manipulation:** The vulnerability arises from Varnish's insufficient handling of hop-by-hop headers. It allows attackers to control which headers are forwarded to the backend.
-   **Bypassing VCL:**  By filtering crucial headers, attackers can bypass request routing logic defined in the Varnish Configuration Language (VCL).
-   **Breaking HTTP/1 Framing:** The ability to filter the `Content-Length` header makes it possible to break the HTTP/1 protocol framing, making the message parsing unpredictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Request Smuggling:** Attackers can inject malicious requests into the stream, potentially leading to backend server compromise or data manipulation.
-   **Bypassing Security Controls:** The ability to manipulate the `Host` header can allow attackers to bypass security mechanisms that rely on this header for routing and access control.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By breaking HTTP/1 framing or manipulating headers in unexpected ways, attackers can cause the backend server to malfunction or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack is performed via crafted HTTP requests. The attacker needs to send requests with a manipulated `Connection` header.
-   The `Connection` header is used to specify the hop-by-hop headers

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Varnish Cache server. This implies the attacker can be external if the Varnish Cache server is exposed publicly, or internal if the Varnish Cache server is used behind other load balancers.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability is referred to as VSV00010 within the Varnish security advisories.
-   The provided content includes details of a mitigation strategy using a VCL snippet to block connections with manipulated `Connection` headers.
-   The vulnerability was discovered by Martin van Kervel Smedshammer.
-   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Varnish Cache releases 7.1.2, 7.2.1 and later.
-   All versions of the Varnish Cache 6.0 LTS series are not affected
