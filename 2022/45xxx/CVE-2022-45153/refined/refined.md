Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-45153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `saphanabootstrap-formula` Salt state (`hana/ha_cluster.sls`) manages sudoers file entries. It uses a temporary file (`/tmp/sudoers`) which is initially copied from `/etc/sudoers`, then appends specific entries. The problem is that arbitrary users can write to `/tmp/sudoers` before the salt state is executed, thus allowing a malicious user to insert arbitrary sudo rules. The subsequent `file.copy` operation, due to the `force: True` parameter, would copy the tampered `/tmp/sudoers` file to `/etc/sudoers` and grant the malicious user root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The use of `/tmp/sudoers` as a temporary file without proper access control creates a race condition. Any user can create or modify the file before the `file.copy` state is executed.
2.  **Unconditional Copy with `force: True`:**  The `file.copy` state uses the `force: true` parameter, which overwrites `/etc/sudoers` with the content of `/tmp/sudoers` without verifying that the content is valid or authorized.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows any user to gain root access by manipulating the sudoers file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for **complete system compromise**. A malicious user who can write to `/tmp/sudoers` can escalate their privileges to root, allowing them to:

*   Execute arbitrary commands as root
*   Access and modify any files on the system
*   Install malware or other malicious software
*   Disrupt or disable system services

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local Access:**  The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable Salt state is being applied.
2.  **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to write to the `/tmp/sudoers` file before the vulnerable Salt state is applied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Non-root User Access:** The attacker only needs to be a non-root user who can log in to the target system.
2.  **File Write Permission:** The attacker needs write permission to the `/tmp` directory.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by changing the approach of modifying the sudoers configuration by directly creating a new file under `/etc/sudoers.d/` which is managed by salt and doesn't rely on temporary files, also visudo is used to validate the content before being written.
