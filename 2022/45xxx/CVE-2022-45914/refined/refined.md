Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-45914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2022-45914 is the lack of authentication in the ETAG-TECH protocol used by Zhuhai Suny Technology ESL (Electronic Shelf Label) tags. This allows an attacker to forge messages and display arbitrary content on the tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Authentication:** The ETAG-TECH protocol does not implement any form of authentication, allowing any party to send commands to the ESL tags.
*   **Insecure Protocol Design:** The custom 433 MHz protocol lacks basic security measures, making it susceptible to replay attacks and message forging.
*   **Use of RLE compression:** While not a direct vulnerability, the custom RLE compression algorithm increases the complexity of protocol analysis and message construction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Displaying Arbitrary Content:** An attacker can display any desired content on the ESL tags, including misleading prices, promotional messages, or malicious content such as phishing QR codes.
*   **Disrupting Retail Operations:** By displaying incorrect prices or obstructing legitimate content, attackers can disrupt retail operations, potentially leading to financial losses and customer dissatisfaction.
*   **Potential for Phishing Attacks:** The ability to display arbitrary QR codes could be exploited to direct customers to malicious websites.
*   **Misinformation in sensitive environments:** The tags are also used in hospitals and storage facilities, where changes to displayed information could cause severe disruptions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Radio Frequency (RF) Communication:** The attack is carried out by transmitting forged messages over the 433 MHz frequency used by the ESL tags.
*   **Direct RF Transmission:** No direct access to the tags or the base station is required. The attacker needs to be within RF range of the tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **RF Transmission Capability:** The attacker needs to have the ability to transmit radio signals on the 433 MHz band, which can be achieved using devices like HackRF.
*   **Knowledge of ETAG-TECH Protocol:** The attacker must have knowledge of the ETAG-TECH protocol including the frame structure, compression algorithm and the CRC calculation method.
*   **Tag ID:** The attacker needs the tag ID, which can be obtained by sniffing the RF traffic, or by reading the barcode on the tag.
*   **Proximity to Tags:** The attacker needs to be within the radio range of the ESL tags to transmit the malicious messages.

**Additional Details:**

*   The communication protocol utilizes a Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation.
*   The protocol uses two different baud rates: 175 kbps for wake-up frames and 100 kbps for data transfer.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab and presented at the hardwear.io security conference.
*   The vendor was contacted multiple times, but did not respond, and no patch is currently available.
*   Proof of concept exploits include capturing and replaying valid communication and crafting custom messages to display arbitrary content.
