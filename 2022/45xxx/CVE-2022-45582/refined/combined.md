# Open redirect / phishing attack via "success\_url" parameter in OpenStack

|  | [OpenStack Security Advisory](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa) | Won't Fix | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

The "success\_url" param is used when updating the project snapshot and it lacks sanitizing the input URL that allows an attacker to redirect the user to another website.

For instance, the URL below will redirect you to <https://hacker.com>:

<https://xxx.com/project/snapshots/a54c1d97-d354-4171-9602-52fdf0949e83/update/?success_url=https://hacker.com>

The attacker can send this link to the user and when they click on the "Update" button the request and response will look like this:

[+] Request

Impact: The attacker can trick redirect users to the cloned website to steal information, a so-called Phishing Attack.

CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')

<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html>

I have tested it on OpenStack Xena so the Horizon dashboard could be between version 20.0.0 to 20.1.2. I haven't tested the bug on other versions.

Unfortunately, I have discovered this bug when pen-testing a black box project so I do not have the log file. Hope my information helps you to understand the bug.

I confirmed it.

Using "success\_url" parameter in an URL was introduced in commit a436b12acc85d474f4e71404de771d7143421eed and the corresponding gerrit review is [https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/270461](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/%2B/270461) .

The affected version is horizon 12.0.0 and later (up to the master).

The URL parameter "success\_url" is used to control a page shown after succeeding the snapshot update operation, but passing the full URL is not a good way to achieve the goal. Horizon should not depend on an URL passed from users. It should be decided internally.

Perhaps a fix would be to define a subclass of [1] instead of using "success\_url" from request.GET.

Vishal: Is it the Horizon team's assessment that this defect represents a severe enough risk to warrant stable branch backports and a coordinated publication of a security advisory? If not, then we can switch it to public immediately and the fix can just be pushed normally into Gerrit.

fungi: yeah, it looks like a security issue to me and we should fix and merge it asap in master and stable branches. I am waiting for the horizon CoreSec team and the author of this bug to review the patch I added in #6.

The author seems to indicate in comment #7 (two weeks ago) that the supplied patch works to mitigate the vulnerability. Let me know if you plan to reach out to the Horizon reviewers, or if I should do so, as they don't appear to have weighed in yet. At this point it's taken so long that we've probably missed the opportunity to avoid releasing Zed without this bug.

Given the long times between providing a fix and reviewing it so far, the Horizon team's priority for this problem seems to be very low, which is why I asked whether we should just go ahead and make it public as soon as possible, rather than spending even more time trying to coordinate supplying backported patches to downstream stakeholders in private and scheduling an advisory (which would add at least another week after all the backports are ready).

The proposed patch mitigates the issue by removing the redirect entirely, which of course works, but degrades the user experience. We can merge it as a stopgap solution, but a correct long-term fix would be to validate the url before redirecting, like we do here:

After further discussion with Vishal Manchanda, the risk implied by this bug is minor enough that the most expedient solution will be to go public with it now and follow our lower-effort public security process: <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#process>

Please push the proposed fix(es) to Gerrit and mention this report in the commit message, so it can be reviewed there with full context.

The fix for horizon's stable/yoga branch doesn't appear to pass testing yet, and the fixes for stable/zed and stable/xena still need to be reviewed and approved by horizon developers as well. Once that is done, we can proceed with issuing an advisory.

Given this bug report is over 2 years old and took a year in public just to get into stable point releases, it doesn't seem to rise to the level of urgency where we'd issue an OSSA. As such, I'm closing the Security Advisory task as Won't Fix, but if there are any dissenting opinions I'm happy to reopen and revisit that decision.

web application to control an OpenStack cloud, which could lead to
phishing.
