Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `success_url` parameter within the OpenStack Horizon dashboard when updating project snapshots. The application directly uses the provided URL for redirection without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The application allows a user-supplied URL to control the redirect location after an action (snapshot update). This is a classic Open Redirect vulnerability.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `success_url` parameter before using it in a redirect, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker can craft a malicious link with a crafted `success_url` to redirect users to a cloned or attacker-controlled website.
- **Information Theft:**  Users might be tricked into providing sensitive information (credentials, etc.) on the attacker's phishing site, leading to potential data breaches or account compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The primary attack vector is through crafting a URL with a malicious `success_url` parameter and tricking users into clicking it. This can be done via email, instant messaging, or other social engineering techniques.
- The vulnerable endpoint is `/project/snapshots/<snapshot_id>/update/`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a valid URL to the vulnerable endpoint with the `success_url` parameter set to a malicious site.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated in order to construct the malicious URL. They just need a way to send it to the victim.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `a436b12acc85d474f4e71404de771d7143421eed` and affects Horizon versions 12.0.0 and later (including master).
- The fix involves removing the usage of the `success_url` parameter from request.GET within the `UpdateView` class.
- A more complete solution was suggested which would validate the URL before redirecting similar to the code found in  `horizon/workflows/views.py`. However, the initial fix was to remove the redirect functionality altogether for the short term.
- Patches have been backported to multiple stable branches, including wallaby, xena, and zed.
- This issue is also referenced in Debian LTS advisory DLA-3676-1 and DLA-3678-1.
