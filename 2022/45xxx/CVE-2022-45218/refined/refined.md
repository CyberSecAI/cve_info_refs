Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when displaying an authentication error message. Specifically, the application fails to encode or sanitize a crafted payload when an employee login attempt fails, resulting in the payload being rendered directly in the HTML response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS, where malicious JavaScript can be injected into the error message and executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session.
- Session Hijacking: The attacker can potentially steal session cookies or tokens and hijack the victim's session.
- Data Theft: The attacker can steal sensitive data such as user credentials or other information displayed on the page.
- Defacement: The attacker can alter the appearance of the web page.
- Phishing: The attacker can redirect the user to a phishing website disguised as the legitimate site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Authentication Error Message: The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker injects a malicious script as part of the employee login process causing the injected code to be rendered as part of the error message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which requires access to the network where the application is deployed.
- Crafting Malicious Payload: The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious JavaScript payload suitable for injection.
- Local attack:  The provided document lists the attack type as 'Local'. It should be noted that this is incorrect, as the vulnerability would be triggered remotely by an attacker.
