- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Advanced Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress versions 1.7.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions without their consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to make changes to the booking calendar, modify settings, or perform other administrative tasks by forcing an authenticated user to unknowingly submit malicious requests.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., via a link or a hidden form on a website) that, when accessed by an authenticated user, triggers unintended actions within the vulnerable plugin on the user's behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a webpage that includes the malicious CSRF request. The attacker does not require prior authentication.
