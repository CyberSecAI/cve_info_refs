CVE-2022-45611 impact rationale

The reported vulnerability CVE-2022-45611 can be exploited on these products.
The  potential  impact  is  reading,  changing  and  deletion  of  PharmaHelp  configuration,
operator, and master data.

CVE-2022-45611 Cybersecurity recommendations

To mitigate this vulnerability:

•  The PharmaHelp system network should be segmented (isolated).
•  Only devices which need to have access to the PharmaHelp system should be

able to connect to the PharmaHelp server.

•  Access to PharmaHelp workstation(s) and terminals should be restricted.
•  User accounts which are not required any more should be deleted.

General Cybersecurity recommendations

Proper cybersecurity hygiene and behavior is required to safely integrate devices into
IT infrastructure. The Fresenius Group recommends operators of devices and software
to incorporate the following industry best practices into their defense-in-depth strategy:

Conduct  a  comprehensive  and  periodic  security  risk  assessment  on  the  network  in
accordance with operational security best practices such as ISO 27002

•  Minimize network exposure for all devices and systems, and ensure that they are

not accessible from the Internet

•  Locate Fresenius devices behind firewalls, in dedicated networks, isolated from

all other IT networks

•  Monitor and control access and traffic to the dedicated network
•

Implement application firewalls capable of deep packet inspection to help protect
against zero-day vulnerabilities and the latest exploits

•  Use appropriate authentication and authorization of users on the network
•  Use complex passwords for all user accounts. Complex passwords should contain
a good mixture of upper/lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords
should  also  not  be  based  on  dictionary  words  and  should  contain  at  least  ten
characters
Implement  physical  controls  that  ensure  no  unauthorized  persons  would  have
access to the devices and systems

•

•  Ensure that all programming software and equipment (service laptops, etc.) are
kept in locked cabinets and are never connected to any network other than the
network they are intended to service

•  Ensure that all portable media used for data exchange with the network (such as

•

CDs, USB drives, etc.) are scanned before use
Implement a process to monitor, prevent and contain malwares and computer
viruses.

Institutionalizing strong cybersecurity policies and following the industry best practices
relative to IT security could minimize exposure to threats. These threats may include
but not limited to: Data Leak, Data Corruption, Data Loss, Network or Service Outage,
etc.
