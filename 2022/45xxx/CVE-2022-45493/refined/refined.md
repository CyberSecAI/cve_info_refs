- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The parameter string passed to `json_parse_key()` is not properly sanitized and points to an out-of-bounds position assigned by an upper-layer function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap out-of-bounds write in `json_parse_key()`. The vulnerability can be triggered by calling `json_parse_ex()` with specific flag combinations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A heap buffer overflow, which could lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted JSON string and specific flags to the `json_parse_ex` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious JSON input to the vulnerable function.
