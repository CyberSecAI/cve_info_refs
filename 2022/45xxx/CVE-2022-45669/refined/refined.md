Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-45669 (based on the content, though the description is a placeholder)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` module of the Tenda i22 router firmware when handling `/goform/WifiMacFilterGet` requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper bounds checking on the `index` parameter within the `formWifiMacFilterGet` function. Sending an oversized string for the `index` parameter overflows the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that sending a large string in the `index` parameter can lead to a denial-of-service condition, likely crashing the affected service or the router itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specifically crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiMacFilterGet` endpoint.
- **`index` Parameter:**  The malicious payload is delivered through the `index` parameter within the POST request's form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable router, as they need to send HTTP requests to it.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable endpoint: `/goform/WifiMacFilterGet`
- **Ability to craft HTTP request:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda i22 V1.0.0.3(4687).
- The PoC provided in the content shows an example HTTP POST request with an extremely large string for the `index` parameter to trigger the buffer overflow.
