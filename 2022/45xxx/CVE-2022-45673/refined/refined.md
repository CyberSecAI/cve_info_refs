Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Affected Product:** Tenda AC6V1.0 Router

**Affected Firmware Version:** V15.03.05.19

**Root Cause:** The `/goform/fromSysToolRestoreSet` endpoint lacks proper CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The router's firmware does not implement sufficient measures to prevent CSRF attacks on the `fromSysToolRestoreSet` function. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions.
*   **Predictable endpoint:** The endpoint `/goform/fromSysToolRestoreSet` is fixed and can be easily targeted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates that a successful CSRF attack can lead to a device reset, resulting in a denial of service. This could disrupt network connectivity for the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSRF Attack:** An attacker can craft a malicious webpage or email containing a request that targets the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/fromSysToolRestoreSet` on the Tenda router.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a victim user, already logged into the Tenda router's web interface, to visit the malicious webpage or click a link. This triggers the crafted request, exploiting the user's authenticated session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be external to the victim's network, as long as they can host a malicious webpage or send a malicious email accessible to the victim.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker must rely on social engineering to lure the victim to trigger the crafted request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The POC provided uses a `GET` request to the vulnerable endpoint with the required form data encoded in the URL, highlighting how easy it is to trigger this CSRF vulnerability.
*   The `Host` header of the request is `192.168.204.133` which is the routerâ€™s local IP address indicating the attack occurs via the user's local network.
*  The `Content-Length` of the request is `11525`.
*  The Content-Type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
*   The lack of CSRF protection in the Tenda router allows the attacker to make requests without a valid security token.
