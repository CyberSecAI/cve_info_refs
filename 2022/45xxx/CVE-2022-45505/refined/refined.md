Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/goform/exeCommand` endpoint of the Tenda W30E router's firmware.
- The `cmdinput` parameter from the POST request is copied to a local buffer `s` using the `strcpy` function without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The lack of size validation when copying `cmdinput` to the stack buffer `s` allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer size, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that sending an oversized payload for `cmdinput` can crash the router.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The text mentions that an attacker could potentially craft an exploit ("finally you can write an exp to get a root shell") to achieve remote code execution by overwriting the return address or other critical data on the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/exeCommand` endpoint.
- **`cmdinput` Parameter:** The attack vector relies on overflowing the `cmdinput` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Tenda W30E router or have network access to it.
- **HTTP Request Sending:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.
- **Authentication (possibly bypassed):** The PoC includes an authentication bypass before sending the overflowing request, suggesting the vulnerability can be exploited without logging in, or that the authentication can be bypassed.
