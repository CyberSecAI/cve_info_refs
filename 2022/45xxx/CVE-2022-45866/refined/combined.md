Fix qpress directory traversal vulnerability ([PierreLvx#6](https://github.com/PierreLvx/qpress/pull/6))

```
A bad actor user can prepare the payload as:

```
mkdir -p AAAAAAAAA/secure_file_priv_dir
touch AAAAAAAAA/secure_file_priv_dir/evil.so
qpress -r AAAAAAAAA payload.qp
Then edit the payload.qp in a hex editor or sed to replace AAAAAAAAA with ../../../
(example: sed -i 's/AAAAAAAAA/..\/..\/..\//' payload.qp)
```

Fix bug by checking the directory and reject the command if find the attempt to traversal

Test: see example above and try to reproduce it. Before fix you can observe
traversal. After fix - the error message(File path contains directory traversal
which is not allowed.) shown, no traversal observe.

### @Chaloff **[Chaloff](/Chaloff)** commented [Aug 19, 2022](#issue-1344756488)

There is a memory corruption issue inside the quicklz.c source file that ships

with Percona XtraBackup. Specifically the problem happens on copying

user-supplied binary data over heap allocated memory buffers of user-controlled

size. This allows corruption of heap data structures and potential arbitrary

code execution.

The code in question is inside the qlz\_decompress function of quicklz.c file:

```
size_t qlz_decompress(const char *source, void *destination, qlz_state_decompress *state)
{
        size_t dsiz = qlz_size_decompressed(source);

        if (state->stream_counter + qlz_size_decompressed(source) - 1 >= QLZ_STREAMING_BUFFER)
        {
                if((*source & 1) == 1)
                {
                        reset_table_decompress(state);
                        dsiz = qlz_decompress_core((const unsigned char *)source, (unsigned char *)destination, dsiz, state, (const unsigned char *)destination);
                }
                else
                {
                        memcpy(destination, source + qlz_size_header(source), dsiz);
                }
                state->stream_counter = 0;
                reset_table_decompress(state);
        }
        else
        {
                unsigned char *dst = state->stream_buffer + state->stream_counter;
                if((*source & 1) == 1)
                {
                        dsiz = qlz_decompress_core((const unsigned char *)source, dst, dsiz, state, (const unsigned char *)state->stream_buffer);
                }
                else
                {
                        memcpy(dst, source + qlz_size_header(source), dsiz);
                        reset_table_decompress(state);
                }
                memcpy(destination, dst, dsiz);
                state->stream_counter += dsiz;
        }
        return dsiz;
}

```

Note the first memcpy invocation: that does copy data from user-provided

compressed file into a heap-allocated buffer for which size is also controlled

by the user via the compressed file header. This allows heap corruption with

user-controlled data. Potentially this means arbitrary code execution for the

processes that utilize the vulnerable function - one example is xbstream with

—decompress flag.

Steps to reproduce:

* Create a compressed file, e.g. with qpress from some file larger than 65535

  bytes.
* Edit compressed file so that the four bytes at offset 8 are changed to be

I will get back on the license once I hear back internally.

For now, I can see that the provided patch breaks the software functionality:

```
xtrabackup --backup --port=3306 --stream=xbstream --parallel=16 --compress --compress-threads=4 --encrypt=AES256 --encrypt-key='percona_xtrabackup_is_awesome___' --encrypt-threads=4 --encrypt-chunk-size=8K > backup.out

mkdir out

xbstream -xv --parallel=1 --decompress --decompress-threads=1 --decrypt=AES256 --encrypt-key='percona_xtrabackup_is_awesome___' --encrypt-threads=1 -C out < backup.out

```

This produces an error:

```
sys/sys_config.ibd.qp.xbcrypt
Error: compressed file was corrupted - header data size and actual data size mismatch - can’t decompress
decompress: error running decompression.
decrypt: write to destination failed.
xbstream: my_write() failed.
exit code: 1

```

The fix in qpress are pretty simple and well tested - it just check boundaries of two arrays (source and target) before decompress. The problem seems to be in calling this qpress function - qlz\_decompress(...) - we need to pass the allocated size of source and target arrays to be able to check against it. I do it like this: `thd->to_alloc_size = decomp_file->decomp_ctxt->chunk_size; thd->from_alloc_size = qlz_size_compressed(decomp_file->header);` Looks like it's incorrect way. Can you advise me here how to do it correctly? Thanks in advance |

| Hi [@Chaloff](https://github.com/Chaloff) . I spent sometime investigating this issue.

`[Quicklz decompression memory corruption issue fix](/percona/percona-xtrabackup/pull/1366/commits/dac3d82f559efbf06d116c066d30e688fe3fb323 "Quicklz decompression memory corruption issue fix

There is a memory corruption issue inside the quicklz.c source file that ships
with Percona XtraBackup. Specifically the problem happens on copying
user-supplied binary data over heap allocated memory buffers of user-controlled
size. This allows corruption of heap data structures and potential arbitrary
code execution.

The code in question is inside the qlz_decompress function of quicklz.c file:

```
size_t qlz_decompress(const char *source, void *destination, qlz_state_decompress *state)
{
        size_t dsiz = qlz_size_decompressed(source);

        if (state->stream_counter + qlz_size_decompressed(source) - 1 >= QLZ_STREAMING_BUFFER)
        {
                if((*source & 1) == 1)
                {
                        reset_table_decompress(state);
                        dsiz = qlz_decompress_core((const unsigned char *)source, (unsigned char *)destination, dsiz, state, (const unsigned char *)destination);
                }
                else
                {
                        memcpy(destination, source + qlz_size_header(source), dsiz);
                }
                state->stream_counter = 0;
                reset_table_decompress(state);
        }
        else
        {
                unsigned char *dst = state->stream_buffer + state->stream_counter;
                if((*source & 1) == 1)
                {
                        dsiz = qlz_decompress_core((const unsigned char *)source, dst, dsiz, state, (const unsigned char *)state->stream_buffer);
                }
                else
                {
                        memcpy(dst, source + qlz_size_header(source), dsiz);
                        reset_table_decompress(state);
                }
                memcpy(destination, dst, dsiz);
                state->stream_counter += dsiz;
        }
        return dsiz;
}
```

Note the first memcpy invocation: that does copy data from user-provided
compressed file into a heap-allocated buffer for which size is also controlled
by the user via the compressed file header. This allows heap corruption with
user-controlled data. Potentially this means arbitrary code execution for the
processes that utilize the vulnerable function - one example is xbstream with
—decompress flag.

Steps to reproduce:

 - Create a compressed file, e.g. with qpress from some file larger than 65535
   bytes.
 - Edit compressed file so that the four bytes at offset 8 are changed to be
   less than 0x10000, for example set to 0x1000 instead.
 - Edit the file so that the byte at offset 50 is an even value to pass the
   test: if((*source & 1) == 1)
 - Replace the bytes of actual file with some recognizable pattern, e.g. 0x41
   0x42 0x43 0x44
 - Add the file to an xbstream file: xbstream -c Demo.qp > Demo.xbstream
 - Now try to extract with decompression using xbstream under a debugger, e.g.
   gdb and observe the corruption: xbstream —decompress -x < Demo.xbstream

```

| [@Chaloff](https://github.com/Chaloff), it appears that in the latest version of your code ([dac3d82](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtrabackup/commit/dac3d82f559efbf06d116c066d30e688fe3fb323)), it is no longer checking the data size in the header against the size of the actual data region of the file.  That means it is no longer actually addressing the vulnerability it is intended to address (= `qpress` trusts the user-supplied header, when it shouldn't).  Am I missing something? |

That means it is no longer actually addressing the vulnerability it is intended to address (= `qpress` trusts the user-supplied header, when it shouldn't).  Am I missing something?  Yes, you are missing something but thanks anyway for the comment :) Please see the change on [line 31 in quicklz.h](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtrabackup/pull/1366/commits/dac3d82f559efbf06d116c066d30e688fe3fb323#diff-9aebfc227a29909f9fea4da078c9ae492bfaa7649e28ecf0307287666a732947R31) This simple change triggers the code on lines 576, 584, 669 and 711 in quicklz.c which does the boundary check. Additionally we can corruption check on line 814 as suggested in [this article](https://frama-c.com/2011/04/05/Verifying-the-Compression-Library-QuickLZ.html) - see "Tackling the last alarms" - we only need to write it correctly - I suppose the correct code should looks like: `if(qlz_size_decompressed(source) != qlz_size_compressed(source) + qlz_size_header(source)) return 0;` |

1. [Fix qpress directory traversal vulnerability (](/PierreLvx/qpress/commit/ddb312090ebd5794e81bc6fb1dfb4e79eda48761)[#6](https://github.com/PierreLvx/qpress/pull/6)[)](/PierreLvx/qpress/commit/ddb312090ebd5794e81bc6fb1dfb4e79eda48761)
    …

   ```
   A bad actor user can prepare the payload as:

   ```
   mkdir -p AAAAAAAAA/secure_file_priv_dir
   touch AAAAAAAAA/secure_file_priv_dir/evil.so
   qpress -r AAAAAAAAA payload.qp
   Then edit the payload.qp in a hex editor or sed to replace AAAAAAAAA with ../../../
   (example: sed -i 's/AAAAAAAAA/..\/..\/..\//' payload.qp)
   ```

   Fix bug by checking the directory and reject the command if find the attempt to traversal

   Test: see example above and try to reproduce it. Before fix you can observe
   traversal. After fix - the error message(File path contains directory traversal
   which is not allowed.) shown, no traversal observe.

A bad actor user can prepare the payload as:

```
mkdir -p AAAAAAAAA/secure_file_priv_dir
touch AAAAAAAAA/secure_file_priv_dir/evil.so
qpress -r AAAAAAAAA payload.qp
Then edit the payload.qp in a hex editor or sed to replace AAAAAAAAA with ../../../
(example: sed -i 's/AAAAAAAAA/..\/..\/..\//' payload.qp)

```

Fix bug by checking the directory and reject the command if find the attempt to traversal

Test: see example above and try to reproduce it. Before fix you can observe

traversal. After fix - the error message(File path contains directory traversal

which is not allowed.) shown, no traversal observe.

See:  ``` ➜  ~ diff 6.patch ddb312090ebd5794e81bc6fb1dfb4e79eda48761.patch 1,4c1,4 < From 02a79a793f56e86e2014a606647b158b246811e3 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 < From: Mikhail Chalov <mcchalov@amazon.com> < Date: Wed, 14 Jul 2021 09:35:58 +0200 < Subject: [PATCH] Fix qpress directory traversal vulnerability --- > From ddb312090ebd5794e81bc6fb1dfb4e79eda48761 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 > From: Mikhail Chalov <mike.chalov@gmail.com> > Date: Fri, 19 Aug 2022 14:33:18 -0700 > Subject: [PATCH] Fix qpress directory traversal vulnerability (#6) 25a26,27 > > Co-authored-by: Mikhail Chalov <mcchalov@amazon.com>  ``` |
