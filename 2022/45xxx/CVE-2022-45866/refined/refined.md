{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `qpress` file archiver is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient validation of file paths during decompression. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize the paths contained within a compressed archive, allowing an attacker to craft an archive containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite or create files in arbitrary locations on the file system where the `qpress` application has write permissions. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker overwrites a critical system file or injects malicious code.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted Archive: An attacker creates a malicious archive with manipulated file paths containing directory traversal sequences.",
       "Command Line: The attacker then uses the `qpress` tool to decompress this crafted archive."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create or modify a `.qp` archive file. The attacker must also be able to execute the `qpress` application on the target system.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in the `decompress_directory` function of `qpress.cpp`. The fix implemented checks for `../` and `..\\` sequences in the path during decompression to prevent directory traversal."
