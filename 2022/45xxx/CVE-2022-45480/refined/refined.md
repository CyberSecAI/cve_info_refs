Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-45480:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insecure communication: The PC Keyboard application transmits data, including keypresses, in cleartext over the network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Lack of encryption: The application does not use encryption to protect the data transmitted between the server and connected devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Data Exposure: An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position can intercept and read all data transmitted between the server and connected device, including sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the PC Keyboard server and a connected client device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Network proximity: The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the server and the client. This typically implies the attacker is on the same network or has the ability to perform an on-path attack.
