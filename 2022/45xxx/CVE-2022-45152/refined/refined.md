**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request that forces the application to initiate requests to arbitrary systems.
- This allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF attacks, potentially accessing internal resources or interacting with other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request that exploits the vulnerable LTI provider library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Moodle instance.
- No specific privileges are mentioned. The attacker would need to interact with the LTI provider.
