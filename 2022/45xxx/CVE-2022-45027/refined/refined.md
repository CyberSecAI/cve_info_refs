Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-45027:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The perfSONAR pScheduler server uses the `Host` header from the HTTP request to determine the local address during participant discovery. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `Host` header to make the server send requests to an arbitrary server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The server is vulnerable to SSRF due to its reliance on the `Host` header for determining the target address, enabling requests to be sent to attacker-controlled or internal servers.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Internal network scanning:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to scan the internal network of the pScheduler server, potentially identifying other vulnerable services or hosts.
- **Information Disclosure:** By observing the server's response to requests sent to different ports, an attacker can differentiate between open and closed ports. The content notes "connection refused" for closed ports vs "an unexpected TLS packet" for open ports.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attacker sends a POST request to the `/pscheduler/tasks` endpoint of the pScheduler server.
- The attacker manipulates the `Host` header in the HTTP request.
- The attacker crafts a JSON payload for a task, but the "spec" is irrelevant, the vulnerability lies within the processing of the `Host` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the pScheduler server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker can be external to the network where the vulnerable perfSONAR instance resides.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The content provides details on how the SSRF vulnerability can be used for port scanning of the internal network, using different error messages to differentiate between closed and open ports.
- The vulnerability was fixed in perfSONAR version 4.4.6.
