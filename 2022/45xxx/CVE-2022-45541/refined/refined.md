Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Version:** EyouCMS version <= 1.6.0-UTF8-SP1
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input when handling a change in the article attribute type, specifically when non-integer characters are included in the `value` parameter within a POST request to `login.php`. This lack of sanitization allows the injection of malicious scripts within error reporting messages.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization and handling of user-supplied values, which leads to reflected XSS.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted POST request to `/cms/eyoucms/login.php?m=admin&c=Index&a=changeTableVal&_ajax=1&lang=cn` with the `value` parameter containing the XSS payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   An authenticated session or access to the admin interface for the vulnerable part of the application to submit the crafted request.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser when they visit a page containing the reflected XSS vulnerability. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Technical Details**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered in the error reporting message when the value parameter contains non-integer characters.
    *   The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject the XSS payload using a POST request with the crafted `value` parameter:
    ```
    POST /cms/eyoucms/login.php?m=admin&c=Index&a=changeTableVal&_ajax=1&lang=cn HTTP/1.1
    Host: 127.0.0.1:80
    ...
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 90

    value=%BA0<script>alert(1)</script>&field=status&id_value=1&id_name=id&table=archives_flag
    ```
