Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45184:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stemmed from invalid path validation within the PowerShell Universal web server. Specifically, the server failed to properly sanitize or validate file paths provided in HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing administrator users to manipulate file paths in HTTP requests. This enabled them to specify paths outside of the intended PowerShell Universal configuration directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allowed a remote attacker with administrator privileges to create arbitrary files on the server, outside of the designated configuration directory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involved sending specially crafted HTTP requests to specific endpoints within the PowerShell Universal web server. These requests included malicious file paths designed to achieve directory traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Privilege:** The attacker needed to have administrator privileges within the PowerShell Universal application to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needed network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PowerShell Universal server.
