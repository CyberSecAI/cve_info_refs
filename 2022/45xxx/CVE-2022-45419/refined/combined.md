Adding a security exception for a site with a mismatched cert should allow access without a warning only as long as the exception exists. However, if you delete an exception, then visit the site again, FF shows no warning. You have to restart FF for the warning to appear again.

STR:

1. Visit <https://download.windowsupdate.com/d/upgr/2021/03/windows10.0-kb5000736-x64_880844224a175033802b3d7a1f40ec304c0548dd.msu> .
2. Notice the warning [1]
3. Add a security exception for the site.
4. Cancel the download.
5. Remove the security exception at tools/settings/certificates/view certificates/servers.
6. Open a new tab and visit the site again. Notice that FF offers to download the file without giving a warning. Cancel the download.
7. Restart FF.
8. Visit the site again.
9. Notice the warning.

[1] Hey Microsoft! Why isn't your cert correct?!?!

BTW FF allows you to download the file without a warning if you continue the download, rather than cancelling it, at step 6.

This is probably expected behavior. For perf reasons sites negotiate a TLS session token with clients to avoid the overhead of doing the full handshake for each new resource a browser is going to request. Browsers make a lot of separate requests for a typical web page with lots of sub-resources (scripts, styles, images, etc) and you don't want to do the handshake for each one. The certificate isn't checked again until the TLS session expires (a day is typical? or until you shut down) so nothing would trigger the need for the deleted exception in this scenario.

Is that right, Dana?

That's all true, but from my reading of the implementation, we should be clearing the TLS session cache when exceptions get removed, here: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/294f10eff7398d6b05beac6aa256d86ac3cb7113/security/manager/ssl/nsCertOverrideService.cpp#704>

Perhaps this is due to the BF cache (or maybe network cache)?

At step 6, what happens if you shift-refresh when viewing the page?

Opening a new tab and visiting the site again shouldn't hit the BF cache, FWIW.

If I complete step 6 as writ, and do shift/refresh afterward, FF clears the address bar. If I then paste the URL back in the address bar and hit "enter", FF offers to download it without showing the scare-screen. Same thing if, after doing the shift/refresh thing, I open a new tab and open the URL. And the same thing if I open a new (non-private) window and open the URL. However, if I open a new private window and go to the URL, it shows the scare screen.

If I don't open a new tab at step 6, but instead shift/refresh in the same tab I used for steps 1-5, FF shows the scare-screen.

Shift-refresh clears the cache for the current site you're visiting, so if you open a new tab and don't visit a site, that won't do anything. It sounds like you're hitting the network cache. Try clearing it before step 6 with history -> clear recent history -> cache?

When I do that immediately after step 5, FF doesn't show the scare-screen at step 6; it just offers to download the file.

Unfortunately the link in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1716082#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Deleting security exception doesn't restore warning") doesn't work any longer (which is why this fell off my radar the first time). I tried reproducing locally, but I couldn't get the same behavior. I don't suppose there's another link you have that behaves the same way?

The link worked for me just a few seconds ago. What error do you get?

Odd - it was refusing connections for me, but now it seems to be working again. In any case, it looks like what's happening is the first connection opens a connection with keep-alive that gets reused after the exception is removed. There's no new (or even resumed) TLS connection.

Dragana, is there a way to reset/clear connections by hostname? Is that even something we would want to do? (context is removing certificate error exceptions)

It is unfortunate that our UX is confusing. I see that it's odd we require a restart when removing an exception while adding an override *is* instant. But we don't think it's a risk for remote attackers and therefore does not qualify as sec-moderate and does not qualify for a bounty.

We should post a "net:cancel-all-connections" notification. That will close, actually make non-reusable, all connection. I think that is fine for this use case.

Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 107

This advisory was updated December 13, 2022 to add CVE-2022-46882 and CVE-2022-46883. Both fixes were included in the original release of Firefox 107, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

#### [#CVE-2022-45403: Service Workers might have learned size of cross-origin media files](#CVE-2022-45403)

Reporter
Anne van Kesteren and Karl Tomlinson
Impact
high
##### Description

Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin responses; but timing information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests might have allowed them to determine the presence or length of a media file.

#### [#CVE-2022-45404: Fullscreen notification bypass](#CVE-2022-45404)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan
Impact
high
##### Description

Through a series of popup and `window.print()` calls, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.

#### [#CVE-2022-45406: Use-after-free of a JavaScript Realm](#CVE-2022-45406)

Reporter
Samuel Groß
Impact
high
##### Description

If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2022-45410: ServiceWorker-intercepted requests bypassed SameSite cookie policy](#CVE-2022-45410)

Reporter
Dongsung Kim
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with `FetchEvent`, the origin of the request was lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it. This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie protections. This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers.

* [Bug 1658869](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658869)

#### [#CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing was possible via non-standard override headers](#CVE-2022-45411)

Reporter
scarlet
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on `fetch()` and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as `X-Http-Method-Override` that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Firefox has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers.

#### [#CVE-2022-45412: Symlinks may resolve to partially uninitialized buffers](#CVE-2022-45412)

Reporter
Armin Ebert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When resolving a symlink such as `file:///proc/self/fd/1`, an error message may be produced where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in the buffer.
*This bug only affects Firefox on Unix-based operated systems (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2022-45413: SameSite=Strict cookies could have been sent cross-site via intent URLs](#CVE-2022-45413)

Reporter
Axel Chong
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Using the `S.browser_fallback_url parameter` parameter, an attacker could redirect a user to a URL and cause SameSite=Strict cookies to be sent.
*This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2022-40674: Use-after-free vulnerability in expat](#CVE-2022-40674)

Reporter
Rhodri James
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A flaw in XML parsing could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.
*In official releases of Firefox this vulnerability is mitigated by wasm sandboxing; versions managed by Linux distributions may have other settings.*

#### [#CVE-2022-45415: Downloaded file may have been saved with malicious extension](#CVE-2022-45415)

Reporter
Jefferson Scher and Jayateertha Guruprasad
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When downloading an HTML file, if the title of the page was formatted as a filename with a malicious extension, Firefox may have saved the file with that extension, leading to possible system compromise if the downloaded file was later ran.

#### [#CVE-2022-45416: Keystroke Side-Channel Leakage](#CVE-2022-45416)

Reporter
Erik Kraft, Martin Schwarzl, and Andrew McCreight
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Keyboard events reference strings like "KeyA" that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread addresses. Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out which keys were being pressed.

#### [#CVE-2022-45417: Service Workers in Private Browsing Mode may have been written to disk](#CVE-2022-45417)

Reporter
Kagami
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode. This would not have persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode details to disk.

#### [#CVE-2022-45419: Deleting a security exception did not take effect immediately](#CVE-2022-45419)

Reporter
Ronald Crane
Impact
low
##### Description

If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted.
