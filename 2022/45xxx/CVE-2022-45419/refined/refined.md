Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles TLS connections and security exceptions. When a user adds a security exception for a site with an invalid TLS certificate, Firefox establishes a TLS connection, and if the user subsequently removes this exception, Firefox does not immediately invalidate the existing connection. This means the browser continues to reuse the connection, bypassing the expected security warning, even after the exception is deleted. The core issue is that the TLS session cache and keep-alive connections are not cleared when a certificate exception is removed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **TLS Session Reuse:** Firefox reuses existing TLS connections, including keep-alive connections.
*   **Cache Invalidation Failure:** The TLS session cache and existing keep-alive connections are not cleared when a security exception is removed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Security Warnings:** After removing a security exception for a site with an invalid certificate, the browser continues to trust the connection without warning the user.
*   **Continued Access to Untrusted Sites:** Users may unknowingly access sites with invalid certificates even after removing the associated exceptions, giving the false impression that the security settings are in effect.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **User Action:** The user must first add a security exception for a site.
2.  **Ongoing Connection:** An ongoing TLS connection to the site needs to be active or in a keep-alive state.
3.  **Exception Removal:** The user then deletes the security exception.
4.  **Subsequent Access:** The user revisits the site without restarting Firefox, leading to the reuse of the cached connection and a bypassed warning.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not directly exploit the vulnerability, it's a client-side issue caused by the browser not invalidating existing connections when a security exception is removed.
*   The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
    *   Tricking a user into adding an exception for a malicious site.
    *   Using a site with a valid cert, then switching to a malicious cert after the initial exception, but keeping a keep-alive connection open, then relying on the lack of invalidation of the connection after the user removes the exception.
*   No specific position or capabilities are required, as the vulnerability is triggered by a series of user actions and browser behavior.
*   An attacker could leverage the vulnerability to continue to trick users into accessing a malicious site, but a user must take the initial action to add a security exception.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was resolved by clearing all ongoing connections when removing certificate error overrides. This ensures that the browser fetches a new connection and re-evaluates the certificate, thus applying the removal of the security exception.
*   The fix was implemented by posting a "net:cancel-all-connections" notification when an exception is removed, which makes all existing connections non-reusable.
