Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of the `Name` parameter in the "Add New System User" module of the Book Store Management System. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code that is later executed by the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Specifically, the vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the malicious script is injected in the request and reflected back to the user without proper handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the affected page, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft (e.g., cookies, session tokens)
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
  - Defacing the website
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious JavaScript payload injected into the `Name` parameter when adding a new system user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the application, which can be done locally and remotely if the application is exposed to the network.
- The attacker doesn't need specific privileges, just the ability to access the vulnerable functionality (Add New System User module).

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerable system is "Book Store Management System v1.0.0" which uses PHP CodeIgniter 3 framework
- The vulnerability is located in the "Add New System User" module where the `Name` field is vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Rajeshwar Singh.
- The product is available at sourcecodester.com
