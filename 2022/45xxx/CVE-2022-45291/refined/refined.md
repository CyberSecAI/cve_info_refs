Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2022-45291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause stems from multiple issues:
   - **Hardcoded password and weak password handling:** The software uses a hardcoded password (`support`) in several places, alongside the user-defined password. This was combined with a weak password hash, making it easily crackable.
   - **Insufficient input validation and access control:** Multiple files lack proper authentication or sanitization, leading to unauthorized access and code injection.
  - **Direct file access:** The software allows direct access to files through user-controlled parameters without proper sanitization or authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Hardcoded Password with weak hash (PWS\_winter.php):**
    *   A hardcoded bcrypt hash is used alongside a user defined password to gain access to PWS\_winter.php. The hash was easily cracked using a common wordlist (`rockyou.txt`).
    *   The correct user password is leaked on the PWS\_winter.php page.

2.  **Limited File Read (PWS\_listfile.php):**
    *   The `file` parameter in `PWS_listfile.php` allows for reading arbitrary files.
    *   Requires the hardcoded password or the bcrypt hash to read `settings.php` or `twitter_keys.php`.
    *   File access is achieved via `file_get_contents` allowing directory traversal, but not local file inclusion (LFI).

3.  **Full File Read (PWS\_frame\_text.php):**
    *   The `showtext` parameter in `PWS_frame_text.php`, combined with type `file`, allows reading arbitrary files.
    *   This vulnerability is unauthenticated.

4.  **Full File Read (PWS\_printfile.php):**
    *   The `file` parameter in `PWS_printfile.php` allows reading arbitrary files.
    *   This vulnerability is unauthenticated.

5.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via settings.php:**
    *   The application allows modification of the `settings.php` file through the admin panel.
    *   Lack of input sanitization enables injecting arbitrary PHP code into the file.
    *   This allows for full remote code execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leak sensitive information, including:
    *   User-defined passwords (due to plaintext storage and the hash vulnerability)
    *   Configuration details (settings.php)
    *   Contents of system files such as `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to:
    *   Full server compromise
    *   Installation of backdoors
    *   Ransomware attacks
*  **Data tampering**: Attackers can modify website content and functionality

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities through carefully crafted HTTP GET and POST requests to the vulnerable PHP files.
*   **Admin panel access:** Once an attacker gains access to the admin panel through the leaked hardcoded password, they can exploit other vulnerabilities
*  **Web browser:** The vulnerabilities can be accessed from a web browser

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable PWS\_Dashboard instance.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP requests:** The attacker must understand how to construct HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*  **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints** The attacker must know which endpoints are vulnerable to attack and how to format their requests

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were found in a "Long-Term-Support" version of the software, implying that many installations could be affected.
*   The developers used forum communication to fix the issue in a timely manner.
*   The software is primarily used by hobbyists, leading to the possibility of misconfigurations and unpatched installations.
