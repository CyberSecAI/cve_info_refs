The provided content relates to CVE-2022-45067.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Exclusive Addons Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability exists in the plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the plugin allows.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in, higher-privileged user, will execute unwanted actions within the plugin. This usually involves tricking a user into clicking a link or visiting a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into performing an action that triggers the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but needs an authenticated user to be tricked into initiating a request.
