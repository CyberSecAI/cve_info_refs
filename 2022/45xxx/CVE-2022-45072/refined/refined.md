The provided content is related to CVE-2022-45072.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Multilingual CMS plugin (versions <= 4.5.13) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions while they are authenticated. The specific impact can vary depending on the actions the attacker can trigger.

**Attack vectors:** A CSRF attack typically involves a malicious link or webpage crafted to target a specific action on a vulnerable website. When a user with an active session visits the malicious link, their browser automatically sends the request to the vulnerable site, causing the unwanted action to be executed using the user's active session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit a malicious site or click a malicious link.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the targeted website, but the targeted user does.
