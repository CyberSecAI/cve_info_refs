Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how Firefox (and other browsers initially) handled requests intercepted by a Service Worker's `FetchEvent`. When a service worker intercepted a request and then initiated a new fetch request using `fetch()`, the origin of the original request was lost. This caused the browser to treat the new request as if it originated from the service worker, thus bypassing the SameSite cookie policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of SameSite cookie policy:**  The core issue is the circumvention of the SameSite cookie attribute. This attribute is designed to prevent CSRF attacks by restricting when cookies are sent in cross-site requests. The vulnerability allowed cross-site requests initiated by a service worker to include cookies that should have been restricted by the SameSite policy (specifically, `Lax` and `Strict` cookies).
*   **Service Worker Request Ownership:** When a `fetch()` was called from within a service worker's fetch event, the service worker took ownership of the request. This caused the browser to lose the original request's origin, thus sending cookies as if the request was same-site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF vulnerability:**  By bypassing the SameSite cookie protections, a malicious third-party website could potentially perform CSRF attacks against a user by exploiting the service worker behavior.
*   **Cookie leakage:**  Sensitive cookies intended to be restricted to same-site requests could be sent in cross-site requests, potentially allowing attackers to gain access to session information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Service Worker registration:** An attacker would need a mechanism to register a malicious service worker on a vulnerable website or a site that users frequent.
*   **FetchEvent interception:** Once the service worker is active, it would intercept any requests made from the page by using `FetchEvent`, and then issue a new `fetch()` request within the service worker.
*   **Cross-site navigation/request:** By crafting a request from the service worker, a malicious party could then initiate a cross-site request that inappropriately sends SameSite cookies from a different domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to register a service worker:** The attacker must be able to register a service worker on a website, either by compromising it directly or leveraging a vulnerability allowing them to inject one.
*   **Ability to control service worker code:** They need control over the logic of the service worker to implement the malicious request.
*   **Targeted website with SameSite cookies:** The attack requires the user to have cookies set with SameSite attributes for the targeted website they are trying to attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in multiple browsers, including Chromium-based browsers.
*   The issue was addressed by a specification change (<https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1345>) that preserved the origin of requests in the context of a service worker.
*   The fix involves propagating `InterceptedHttpChannel` information to the fetch's channel, ensuring the correct origin is used for same-site cookie checks.
*   The issue was initially reported in August 2020 and fixed in Firefox 107.
*   The fix was also backported to Firefox ESR 102.5.
*   A test case `testing/web-platform/tests/service-workers/service-worker/same-site-cookies.https.html` covers the vulnerability.
