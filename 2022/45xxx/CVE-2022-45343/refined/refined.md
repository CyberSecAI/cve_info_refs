{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the `Q_IsTypeOn` function due to incorrect memory management when handling BIFS (Binary Format for Scenes) data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-use-after-free"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to program crashes, unexpected behavior, and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed MP4 file containing crafted BIFS data. Specifically, the `-bt poc` option of the `MP4Box` tool is used to trigger the vulnerability with a proof-of-concept file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application. This requires the ability to provide the input file, often through user interaction or by hosting it on a website."
