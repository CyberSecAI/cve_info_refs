{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-45928",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because multiple endpoints allow a user to pass an 'htmlFile' parameter, which is then included in the HTML output rendering pipeline. The Content Server evaluates and executes Oscript code found in HTML files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion",
        "Unrestricted execution of Oscript code"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary Oscript code, which can lead to manipulation of files on the filesystem, creation of new network connections, or execution of OS system commands, potentially resulting in full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker must first create a file with malicious Oscript code on the server. This can be achieved by exploiting another vulnerability (CVE-2022-45925, specifically the side effect of 3.2). After creating the file, the attacker includes it using the vulnerable 'htmlFile' parameter via a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint, such as 'commdirectory.LookFeel'.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a low-privilege user and have the ability to send HTTP requests to the server. Exploiting the vulnerability fully requires the attacker to first exploit the NTLM hash capture vulnerability (CVE-2022-45925) or some other method for creating files on the server."

    "other_vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-45924",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary File Deletion"
      ],
       "impact": "Low privilege users can delete arbitrary files on the serverâ€™s local filesystem.",
        "attack_vectors": "By creating a 'Customer View Template' object to get a valid cacheID, then using the `itemtemplate.createtemplate2` endpoint to specify the file to be deleted using the `DefinitionFile` parameter."
    },
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-45922",
      "weaknesses": [
       "Privilege Escalation",
        "Insecure Cookie Handling"
      ],
        "impact": "The request handler sets a valid 'AdminPwd' cookie that allows access to unauthorized endpoints without knowing the password.",
        "attack_vectors": "Sending a request to the `ll.KeepAliveSession` endpoint results in a new valid AdminPwd cookie being set."

    },
      {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-45925",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Disclosure",
        "NTLM Hash Capture"
      ],
      "impact": "Sensitive information such as HTTP headers and CGI variables can be exposed. Additionally, NTLM hashes can be captured.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending a request to the `xmlexport` endpoint with the `requestContext` parameter set to 'T' reveals request information. Providing a network share path as the value of the `stylesheet` parameter initiates an SMB connection that could allow the attacker to capture NTLM hashes."
    },
    {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2022-45926",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
        ],
        "impact": "Low privilege users can evaluate webreports, potentially leading to SSRF attacks.",
        "attack_vectors": "By sending a POST request to the `notify.localizeEmailTemplate` endpoint with a webreport in the `msgBody` parameter, a user can evaluate the report. The `LL_WEBREPORT_RESTCLIENT` tag can be used to perform SSRF."
