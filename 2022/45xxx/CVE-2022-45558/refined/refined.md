The provided content discusses a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Left project, which is triggered by a meta redirect. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application processes and renders markdown files, including meta tags. Specifically, the `<meta http-equiv="refresh" ...>` tag is not properly sanitized and is interpreted as a redirect directive.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unsanitized Meta Tags:** The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of input sanitization for meta tags in markdown files. This allows an attacker to embed a meta refresh tag that redirects the user's browser to a malicious website.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The malicious website the user is redirected to then executes Javascript that uses `require('child_process').exec()` to execute system commands, leading to Remote Code Execution on the user's machine.
*   **Insecure use of `child_process.exec`**: The use of `child_process.exec` without proper input validation allows for arbitrary code execution on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. In the provided examples, the commands `open -a /System/Applications/Calculator.app` on macOS and `calc` on Windows are used for demonstration purposes. However, any other command could be executed.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** If the attacker exploits with more sophisticated commands, this can result in complete control of the victim's machine.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Markdown Files:** The attacker needs to create or inject a specially crafted markdown file with the malicious meta redirect tag into the application.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to open/render the malicious markdown file for the attack to succeed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create/inject a markdown file:** The attacker needs to be able to upload, modify, or inject a markdown file into the system where it will be opened by a user.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the application processes the meta redirect tag without proper sanitization.
*   **Hosting for malicious redirect target:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious HTML/JS that contains the RCE commands.

**Additional details (from the content):**

*   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC):** A PoC is available via Google Drive link, providing concrete examples of the attack.
*   **Multiple OS examples:** The vulnerability can be exploited on multiple operating systems, including macOS and Windows.
*   **Specific code examples are provided:** The provided code snippets clearly demonstrate how a meta refresh tag can redirect to a page containing malicious JavaScript which executes code on user's computer.
