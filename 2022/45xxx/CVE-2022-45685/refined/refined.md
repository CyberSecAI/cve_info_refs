  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow when processing deeply nested JSON structures or when the JSON contains a self-referencing map, which leads to uncontrolled recursion during parsing. Specifically, the `JSONObject` constructor, when processing a map with a value that is the map itself, or when processing nested objects/arrays without limit, causes the stack to overflow.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion",
         "Out-of-bounds write (identified in description of CVE-2022-45693, but applies to this CVE too)"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). A successful attack crashes the service due to the stack exhaustion.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By providing a crafted JSON string as input",
        "By providing a Map containing a self-reference"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted input, either through a direct API call or through an external channel that uses the vulnerable library. No special privileges or user interaction are required."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content offers more details than the official CVE description, including the specific code snippets that trigger the vulnerability and the affected versions. It also clarifies that the fix in version 1.5.2 is not complete, as a further issue related to stack overflow still exists, and version 1.5.3 contains the complete fix. The issue stems from the library's failure to limit recursion depth, leading to stack overflow and ultimately DoS. The content also highlights the presence of similar issues in other libraries, indicating that it is a more generic problem."
