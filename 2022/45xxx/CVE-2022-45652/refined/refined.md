Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` module of the Tenda AC6 router. This occurs when handling the `/goform/SetPptpServerCfg` request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `startIp` parameter in the `formSetPPTPServer` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) results in a Denial-of-Service (DoS). It is implied that the buffer overflow can lead to crashing the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/SetPptpServerCfg` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to include a crafted `startIp` parameter with an overly long string of 'a' characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router, meaning that they would need to be on the same network as the router, or able to send a request to the router via the internet (if the router's admin panel is exposed to the internet.)

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda AC6V1.0 V15.03.05.19.
- The overflow is triggered in the `formSetPPTPServer` function.
- The provided POC demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a long string of 'a's in the `startIp` parameter.
