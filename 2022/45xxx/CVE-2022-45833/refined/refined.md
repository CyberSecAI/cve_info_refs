- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Easy WP SMTP plugin (versions <= 1.5.1) is vulnerable to directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory Traversal
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could potentially view all files in a given directory or determine the existence of specific files/directories. This could be used to exploit other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but directory traversal vulnerabilities generally involve manipulating file paths to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an administrator.
