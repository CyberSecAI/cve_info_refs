Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45398:

**CVE-2022-45398:**

*   **Vulnerability:** The Cluster Statistics Plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint. Additionally, the endpoint does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks and CSRF protection for its HTTP endpoint used to delete recorded cluster statistics.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** Any user with `Overall/Read` permission can access the endpoint, while it should require a higher permission level.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The endpoint accepts GET requests instead of requiring POST requests, which makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with `Overall/Read` permission can delete recorded Jenkins cluster statistics.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker could trick a user with `Overall/Read` permission into clicking a malicious link or submitting a form that triggers the deletion of cluster statistics.
    *   An attacker with `Overall/Read` permission can directly send a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permission on the Jenkins instance.
    *   For CSRF exploitation, the attacker would need to trick a user with `Overall/Read` permission into triggering the malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cluster Statistics Plugin version 0.4.6 and earlier.
*   There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication date of the advisory.
*   The vulnerability is identified by SECURITY-2938 in the Jenkins security advisory.
