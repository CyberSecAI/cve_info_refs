Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-45100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper Certificate Validation

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the way Dell PowerScale OneFS handles certificate validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit can lead to a full compromise of the affected system. This includes the potential for unauthorized access, data breaches, and complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote, unauthenticated attacker. This means the attacker does not need prior access to the system or credentials to carry out the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system, and the attack does not require any user interaction. It also has a high complexity for the attacker to exploit.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x through 9.3.x are vulnerable to this issue.
* Specifically, versions 9.1.0.0 through 9.1.0.24, 9.2.1.0 through 9.2.1.17, 9.4.0.0 through 9.4.0.8 and 9.3.0.0 through 9.3.0.6.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to the latest RUP for the affected versions. The fixed versions include >= 9.1.0.25, >= 9.2.1.18, >= 9.4.0.9 and >= 9.3.0.7.
*   Avoid using Secure Remote Services until the patch is applied on the cluster.
