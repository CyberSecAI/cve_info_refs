Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-45420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox renders iframes, specifically when tables are used within the iframe's content. The browser fails to correctly clip the iframe content within its boundaries when certain conditions are met.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect iframe rendering
- Improper handling of clipping when using tables within iframes

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Spoofing/User Confusion:** Attackers can cause iframe content to render outside of the iframe's boundaries, potentially overlapping or obscuring content on the main page. This can lead to user confusion or facilitate spoofing attacks by making malicious content appear to be part of a legitimate site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious website embeds an iframe.
- The iframe contains a table that triggers the rendering bug.
- CSS properties such as `margin-left`, `margin-top` and `background-image` or `background` are used to move the content outside of the iframe's boundaries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the content of an iframe embedded on a victim's web page or host a page with an attacker-controlled iframe.

**Additional details:**
- The issue is related to a previous similar bug, CVE-2022-28286 (Bug 1735265), but involves a stacking context between the cell and table frame.
- The fix involves setting a clip on background items for table columns and column groups when the table row, row group, or table has captured clip.
- The bug was found using a fuzzer and was reported externally.
- The issue is considered a low-severity security vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox on Desktop platforms.
- The fix has been implemented in Firefox 107 and ESR 102.5
- A similar bug is reported as a duplicate under the id 1791948
