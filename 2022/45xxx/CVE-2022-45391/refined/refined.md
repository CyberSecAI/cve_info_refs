Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-45391:

**CVE-2022-45391**

*   **Root Cause:** The NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin disables crucial security measures (SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation) required to establish secure connections to remote servers. By disabling the validation, the plugin allows insecure connections.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. Due to disabled certificate and hostname validation, a malicious actor could intercept communication between the Jenkins controller and the external servers and potentially gain access to sensitive information sent in transit (e.g., credentials).
    *   An attacker can impersonate a trusted server, potentially leading to data leaks or unauthorized actions performed on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between Jenkins and other servers, acting as a MitM.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be on the network path between the Jenkins controller and the remote server it connects to. The attacker must also be capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker with low privileges within Jenkins can also be exploited due to the global nature of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided text also lists other vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins, however, they are unrelated to CVE-2022-45391.
* This vulnerability is addressed in version 4.8.0.146 of the NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin.
