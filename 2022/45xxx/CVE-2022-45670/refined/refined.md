Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `httpd` module of the Tenda i22 router when handling `/goform/setAutoPing` requests. This is due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the `ping1` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The `formSetAutoPing` function does not properly validate the length of the input provided for the `ping1` parameter, leading to a buffer overflow.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates that a successful exploit can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `/goform/setAutoPing`.
    *   The attacker sends a crafted request with an overly long string value for the `ping1` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the Tenda i22 router's web interface.
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerable function is `formSetAutoPing`.
* The specific firmware version affected is Tenda i22 V1.0.0.3(4687).
* The provided POC demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a long string of "A" characters as the `ping1` parameter in the POST request.
* The content provides images showing the vulnerability and the network request.
