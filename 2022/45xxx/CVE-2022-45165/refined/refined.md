Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application service takes a user-controlled parameter and directly uses it to construct an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is SQL injection, caused by the lack of proper input validation on the user-controlled parameter before its incorporation into the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a High impact on confidentiality.  Successful exploitation allows attackers to potentially access sensitive data within the database.
- **Integrity Impact:** The CVSS score indicates no impact on integrity.
- **Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates no impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Low Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L), suggesting that it's relatively easy to exploit once the vulnerable endpoint is identified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs to have low privileges(PR:L) to exploit this vulnerability. This implies that a standard user account can be used in the attack.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction (UI:N) is needed for successful exploitation, implying that the attack can be automated without any interaction with a user.

**Affected Software:**
- Archibus Web Central version 2022.03.01.107

**Patch:**
- Currently, there is no patch available (patch: none).
