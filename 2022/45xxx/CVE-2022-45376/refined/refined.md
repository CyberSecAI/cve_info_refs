- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Side Cart Woocommerce (Ajax) plugin for WordPress versions prior to 2.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions without their knowledge or consent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to execute actions with the privileges of the targeted user. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack involves tricking a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request to the vulnerable plugin's server. This could be done through social engineering, malicious links, or compromised websites.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to execute a forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
