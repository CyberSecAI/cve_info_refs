## Description

An information disclosure issue was discovered which allowed an attacker within Bluetooth broadcast range of a target Megafeis-branded smartlock to acquire sensitive information. This information was the email address and phone number associated with accounts which owned Megafeis smart locks.

The username can then be combined with the API server's password reset issue ([CVE-2022-45637](/advisories/insecure-password-reset-code-expiry-mechanism-for-megafeis-smart)) or the API server's password policy issue ([CVE-2022-45635](/advisories/insecure-password-policy---lack-of-rate-limiting-on-megafeis-sma)) to facilitate an attacker's efforts take over the target user's account.

As of this advisory's publishing date, there has been no response from the manufacturer, nor is WithSecure aware of any remedial action taken.

Additional information on this issue, along with related issues discovered by the researcher, can be found in the following locations:

* The [Megafeis-palm: Exploiting Vulnerabilities to Open Bluetooth SmartLocks](/publications/megafeis-palm--exploiting-vulnerabilities-to-open-bluetooth-smar) publication
* The associated GitHub repository:  <https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm>

## Steps to Reproduce

To demonstrate an attacker's ability to expose the email or phone number associated with a Megafeis smart lock owner's account, the following steps can be performed within version 1.4.2 of the DBD+ application:

* Log in to the DBD+ application using a valid account.
* Once authenticated, press the "Add" button.
* Once a device advertising its Megafeis model number is discovered, tap on it.
* If the lock is already bound to a user, the resulting permission request will expose its owner's login username.

The screenshots below illustrate these steps from the view of the mobile application and reveal the username/email address of a test user researchers created while investigating this issue:

# CVE-2022-45634: Username Disclosure Vulnerability in DBD+ Application Used by Megafeis Smart Locks

## The Issue

While exploring the DBD+ application's functionality, I learned that simply attempting to connect to a lock which is already bound to an existing user's account will reveal that user's email address or phone number. This can be classified as an information disclosure issue and while the vulnerability itself is not a critical risk, it can be chained with [CVE-2022-45637](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/blob/main/CVE-2022-45637) or [CVE-2022-45635](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/blob/main/CVE-2022-45635) to facilitate an attacker's enumeration efforts to hijack legitimate users' accounts.

To demonstrate an attacker's ability to expose sensitive user information such as emails or phone numbers which could be used in account takeover attacks, I have shown screenshots of sample user data being exposed.

## Proof-of-Concept

### Pre-Requisites

* Valid DBD+ account
* Installed DBD+ application

### Demo

To find the email or phone number of a target lock's owner, log in to the DBD+ application using a valid account (which you have created for testing purposes). Once authenticated, find and press the "Add" button. This will enumerate a list of bluetooth low-energy (BLE) devices in the immediate vicinity. Once a device advertising its MEGAFEIS model number is discovered, tap on it. The resulting permission request will expose its owner's login username which can be leveraged for further access as shown in [CVE-2022-45637](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/blob/main/CVE-2022-45637) or [CVE-2022-45635](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/blob/main/CVE-2022-45635).
