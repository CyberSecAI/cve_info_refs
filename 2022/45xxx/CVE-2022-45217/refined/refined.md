Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-45217

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation for the "Level" parameter when adding a new system user within the Book Store Management System. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application and executed when other users view the affected area.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML code within the context of a user's browser.
- Data Theft:  This could lead to the theft of sensitive user data (such as session cookies, login credentials, or personal information).
- Session Hijacking: Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions.
- Defacement: The attacker can alter the appearance of the application or inject misleading content.
- Redirects to Malicious Sites: An attacker could redirect users to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Level" parameter of the "Add New System User" module.
- The attack is described as "Local", which may refer to it being an attack by an authenticated user, not a remote unauthenticated attack. This means that to inject the malicious payload, the attacker would need to have access to the application to add new system users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to access and use the "Add New System User" module within the Book Store Management System. This likely means the attacker needs to have an account with sufficient privileges.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious XSS payload and inject it into the “Level” parameter of the user creation form.
