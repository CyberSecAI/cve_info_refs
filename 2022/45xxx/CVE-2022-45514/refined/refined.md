{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The page will be spliced into a string 's' using sprintf without any size check in the /goform/webExcptypemanFilter endpoint, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to the lack of size validation in sprintf.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The router crashes, and potentially allows an attacker to gain a root shell by crafting a specific exploit.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request with an overly long 'page' parameter to the /goform/webExcptypemanFilter endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router endpoint.  Authentication is required but can be done by sending the login credentials to the /login/Auth endpoint."
