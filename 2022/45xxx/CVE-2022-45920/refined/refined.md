- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A malformed `CreateMonitoredItems` request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing release of memory after effective lifetime (CWE-401) resulting in a memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory exhaustion potentially leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed `CreateMonitoredItems` request over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the vulnerable device and the ability to send malformed requests. No authentication or user interaction is needed for the attack.
