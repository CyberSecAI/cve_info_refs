The provided content details multiple instances of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the "Web-Based Student Clearance System in PHP Free Source Code v1.0".

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Unrestricted input handling in various PHP files, specifically `changepassword.php`, `/Admin/changepassword.php`, `/Admin/add-admin.php`, and `/Admin/add-student.php`. The application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. User-supplied input is directly embedded into the HTML output without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Malicious script execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Data theft:** Attackers can access sensitive user information displayed on the page.
*   **Phishing:** The injected script can be used to redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login forms.
*   **Website defacement:** An attacker could alter the appearance or functionality of the web application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending malicious payloads in POST requests to the affected PHP scripts. The vulnerable parameters include `txtold_password`, `txtnew_password`, `txtconfirm_password`, `txtusername`, and `txtfullname`.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The malicious payloads are injected through the vulnerable parameters and reflected back in the server's response, causing the browser to execute the embedded script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable scripts.
*   The attacker can be an external user of the application or could potentially be an insider.
*   The attacker does not need prior knowledge of other usersâ€™ credentials to exploit this vulnerability and can target any user who accesses the malicious crafted link.

**Vulnerable files and parameters:**
*   `/changepassword.php`: `txtold_password`
*   `/Admin/changepassword.php`: `txtold_password`
*  `/Admin/add-admin.php`: `txtusername`
*  `/Admin/add-student.php`: `txtfullname`
