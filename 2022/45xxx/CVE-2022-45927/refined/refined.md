Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Java application server of OpenText Content Server, specifically within the `cs.war` file. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `_REQUEST` parameter, which is normally set by the HTTP frontend (e.g., CGI or Java servlet). By setting an arbitrary value for this parameter, the attacker can bypass authorization checks within the `QDS` (Query Data Service) endpoints of the Content Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The `QDS` endpoints rely on the `_REQUEST` parameter for authorization, instead of the normal user management functionality of the Content Server.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The Java application server incorrectly handles the `_REQUEST` parameter allowing it to be set by an external user via a `multipart/form-data` POST request.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The QDS endpoints do not adequately validate data types or parameters of incoming requests, except for strings. This limitation is circumvented by the exploit technique.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by creating and executing a process object via a vulnerable endpoint.
*  **Object Creation**: Unauthenticated users can create objects in the Content Server with super-admin privileges (user ID 1000).
*   **Complete System Compromise**: Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the vulnerable server due to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` to the Java application server.
*   **_REQUEST Parameter Manipulation:** Within the POST request, the attacker sets the `_REQUEST` parameter to a value other than `llweb` to bypass authorization checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable Java application server over the network.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The exploit is pre-authenticated, meaning no user credentials are required to initiate the attack.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints**: The attacker needs to know about specific QDS endpoints like `QDS.ObjAction` with `ObjAction=create2` which can be abused to create objects and execute arbitrary code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code resides within `%OT_BASE%/application/cs.war`.
*   The `CGI` frontend (e.g., `cs.exe`) is not vulnerable using the described attack vector because it does not allow manipulation of the `_REQUEST` parameter.
*   The vulnerability was found on September 16, 2022.
*   The vendor released a fix in version 22.4.

This vulnerability is considered **critical** due to the potential for pre-authenticated remote code execution.
