Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45494:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap out-of-bounds write within the `json_parse_object()` function. The core issue is that the parser uses values from `state->dom` directly as `value_ex` without proper bounds checking. Specifically, when the `json_parse_flags_allow_location_information` flag is enabled, the code calculates and assigns struct members using `state->dom` which can go out of allocated bounds. The same vulnerability exists when assigning to `string_ex` struct.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds write: The code writes data beyond the allocated heap buffer.
- Insufficient input validation: The parser does not validate the bounds of `state->dom` before using it to calculate struct members.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The heap out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory, potentially leading to program crashes or unpredictable behavior.
- Potential for further exploitation: Memory corruption vulnerabilities can be chained to other attacks to achieve arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the data being written out of bounds.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JSON input: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted JSON string as input to the `json_parse_ex()` function, combined with a specific flag (`json_parse_flags_allow_location_information`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the JSON input provided to the vulnerable `json.h` library.
- They must also be able to set the parsing flags in such a way that triggers the vulnerable code path (specifically, enabling the `json_parse_flags_allow_location_information` flag).

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was identified by hyrathon.
- The issue was fixed by commit `692679a34c1957db47ebd6852a76c8cfca4a56e4`
- The vulnerability exists in the `json_parse_object()` function at line 1709 in `json.h` (and line 1670 in another instance of the issue, likely a different commit). The location can vary slightly based on the exact version.
- The issue is triggered within `json_parse_ex` at line 2129, and within `json_parse_value` at line 1940.
- AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output is provided in the reports for debugging.

The provided files also contain information on other related issues in the same library, which were fixed in the same commit (`692679a34c1957db47ebd6852a76c8cfca4a56e4`) such as issues #92, #93, #94, #95 and #96, all related to buffer overruns when parsing JSON. These issues were caused due to improper NaN processing and incorrect acceptance of characters after a NaN.
