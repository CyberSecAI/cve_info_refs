{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSetSysTime` function within the httpd module of Tenda AC6V1.0 V15.03.05.19 router firmware.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow in the handling of the 'time' parameter within the `/goform/SetSysTimeCfg` request.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates that a successful exploitation can result in a Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetSysTimeCfg` endpoint, specifically through a crafted 'time' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, which implies network connectivity to the device's management interface."
