Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of a child window, opened via `window.open`, to steal focus and overlap the fullscreen notification prompt of its parent window when `window.print()` is called on the child window simultaneously with repeated calls to `requestFullScreen()` on the parent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Focus Stealing:** The `window.print()` function in a child window can unexpectedly bring that child window into focus, even if the parent window is attempting to go fullscreen.
*   **Bypass of Fullscreen Notification:** The focus stealing allows the child window to overlap the fullscreen notification prompt, potentially causing the user to miss the notification that a window is going fullscreen.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Confusion:** Users may not realize that a window has gone fullscreen because the notification is obscured.
*   **Spoofing Attacks:** An attacker could potentially use a fullscreen window to spoof the browser UI or a legitimate website, tricking users into providing sensitive information or performing malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker opens a child window using `window.open`.
*   The attacker repeatedly calls `requestFullScreen()` on the parent window.
*   The attacker calls `window.print()` on the child window.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in a web page, either through a malicious website or by injecting script.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed by preventing `window.focus()` calls in tab-modal SubDialogs and in print dialogs from raising the window.
*   The issue was present in Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Irvan Kurniawan.
*   The bug was assigned a severity of S2, indicating a significant security concern.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 107, Firefox ESR 102.5, and Thunderbird 102.5.
