Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically within the `fname` component (likely a form field related to the user's first name). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input sanitization
- Lack of output encoding

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code execution: The injected JavaScript code can be executed within the user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Stealing session cookies, which could grant attackers access to user accounts.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local which might be incorrect, it should be remote.  An attacker could inject the malicious code through the `fname` field in a user-facing form. The injected script will execute in the victim's browser when the application renders the injected content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the vulnerable `fname` field. No special privileges are required.
