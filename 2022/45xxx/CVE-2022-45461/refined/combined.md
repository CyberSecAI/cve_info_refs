### VTS22-015

# Hotfix for Security Advisory Impacting NetBackup Java Admin Console

### Revision History

* 1.0 November 15, 2022 – Initial Public Release
* 1.1: November 18, 2022 – Added CVE ID

### Summary

Veritas has addressed an OS Command Injection vulnerability affecting the NetBackup Java Admin Console. Please see the “Notes” section below to determine if you are vulnerable to this issue. Only users explicitly added to the auth.conf file can exploit this vulnerability.

### Issues

## OS Command Injection vulnerability

A vulnerability in the NetBackup Java Admin Console allows authenticated non-root users that have been explicitly added to the auth.conf file to execute arbitrary commands as root.

* CVE ID: [CVE-2022-45461](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45461)
* Severity: High
* CVSS v3.1 Base Score: [7.5 AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
* Potentially impacted components: Primary servers, Media servers, and Clients. (See Notes below).
* Recommended action:
  + NetBackup: Upgrade to 8.2, 8.3.0.1, 8.3.0.2, 9.0.0.1, 9.1.0.1, 10.0.0.1 or 10.1 and apply corresponding Hotfix
  + NetBackup Appliance: Upgrade to 3.2, 3.3.0.1, 3.3.0.2, 4.0.0.1, 4.1.0.1 or 5.0.0.1 MR1 and apply appropriate Hotfix.
  + Flex Appliance: Please apply the NetBackup Hotfix corresponding to the NetBackup Container version on Flex appliances.
  + Flex Scale: Please contact Veritas Technical Support and reference Knowledge Article ID 100053006 to obtain a fix.

### Notes

The /usr/openv/java/auth.conf file grants access to functions in the NetBackup Administration Console. This file is created by default with only root having administrative rights. This file is present on Primary Servers, Media Servers and Clients.

Unless auth.conf is modified by adding non-root users to it and allowing those users to manage Primary servers or Media servers or Clients, the environment is NOT vulnerable, and the fix is not required.

This affects only Unix-based servers and clients. Windows-based servers and clients are unaffected.

The fix updates the vulnerable bpjava binary on the target system that the Java Admin UI console connects to.

For more details about auth.conf please see: <https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/21733320-149123528-0/v41641695-149123528>
