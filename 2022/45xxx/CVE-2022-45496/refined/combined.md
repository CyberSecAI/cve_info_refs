### **[hyrathon](/hyrathon)** commented [Nov 14, 2022](#issue-1447529105)

| Heap Overflow in json\_parse\_string() In `json_parse_string()`, there is a heap out-of-bound write. The bug can be triggered with an invocation of `json_parse_ex()` with specific flags combination. The root cause of the vulnerability is when copy from `src` to `data`, the length of `data`(state.data\_size) is not taken consideration of. Here is the output of Google ASAN when the vulnerability is triggerred:  ``` The flags is 0x5fd6d7d6d6247bff ================================================================= ==4928==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x613000000189 at pc 0x55b62d1096ee bp 0x7ffdc2d4b010 sp 0x7ffdc2d4b008 WRITE of size 1 at 0x613000000189 thread T0     #0 0x55b62d1096ed in json_parse_string /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1540:29     #1 0x55b62d10d6db in json_parse_value /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1949:7     #2 0x55b62d10c8f0 in json_parse_object /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1719:5     #3 0x55b62d10d1c8 in json_parse_value /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1940:5     #4 0x55b62d115c85 in json_parse_ex /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:2129:3     #5 0x55b62d12c192 in main /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/fuzz.c:29:5     #6 0x7fb9e4174d8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16     #7 0x7fb9e4174e3f in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:392:3     #8 0x55b62d03a314 in _start (/home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/san+0x33314) (BuildId: a0e983e1c9c38a8763824dc5481f79d22fe8c82a)  0x613000000189 is located 0 bytes to the right of 329-byte region [0x613000000040,0x613000000189) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x55b62d0bd15e in __interceptor_malloc (/home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/san+0xb615e) (BuildId: a0e983e1c9c38a8763824dc5481f79d22fe8c82a)     #1 0x55b62d114f15 in json_parse_ex /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:2088:18     #2 0x55b62d12c192 in main /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/fuzz.c:29:5     #3 0x7fb9e4174d8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1540:29 in json_parse_string Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c267fff7fe0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c267fff7ff0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c267fff8000: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c267fff8010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c267fff8020: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0c267fff8030: 00[01]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c267fff8040: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c267fff8050: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c267fff8060: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c267fff8070: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c267fff8080: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb ==4928==ABORTING  ```  And the backtrace info from gdb:  ``` #0  json_parse_string (state=0x7fffffffc700, string=0x613000000158) at ./json.h:1540 #1  0x000055555565a6dc in json_parse_value (state=0x7fffffffc700, is_global_object=0, value=0x613000000130) at ./json.h:1949 #2  0x00005555556598f1 in json_parse_object (state=0x7fffffffc700, is_global_object=1, object=0x613000000068) at ./json.h:1719 #3  0x000055555565a1c9 in json_parse_value (state=0x7fffffffc700, is_global_object=4, value=0x613000000040) at ./json.h:1940 #4  0x0000555555662c86 in json_parse_ex (src=0x7fffffffcb48, src_size=35, flags_bitset=6905944396334922751, alloc_func_ptr=0x0, user_data=0x0, result=0x7fffffffdbc0) at ./json.h:2129 #5  0x0000555555679193 in main (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffde08) at fuzz.c:29 #6  0x00007ffff7ca3d90 in __libc_start_call_main (main=main@entry=0x555555678e30 <main>, argc=argc@entry=2, argv=argv@entry=0x7fffffffde08) at ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58 #7  0x00007ffff7ca3e40 in __libc_start_main_impl (main=0x555555678e30 <main>, argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffde08, init=<optimized out>, fini=<optimized out>, rtld_fini=<optimized out>, stack_end=0x7fffffffddf8) at ../csu/libc-start.c:392 #8  0x0000555555587315 in _start ()  ```  The input to trigger this bug is attached. The first 8 bytes are the flags for `json_parse_ex()` and the rest is the content(src).

# Heap Overflow in json.h(json\_parse\_string())

Moderate

[hyrathon](/hyrathon)
published
GHSA-29hf-wrjw-2f28
Dec 30, 2022

## Package

json.h

## Affected versions

before 692679a34c1957db47ebd6852a76c8cfca4a56e4

## Patched versions

692679a34c1957db47ebd6852a76c8cfca4a56e4

## Description

### Impact

In json\_parse\_string() function of json.h(<https://github.com/sheredom/json.h>), there is a heap out-of-bound write. The bug can be triggered with an invocation of json\_parse\_ex() with a specific flags combination. The root cause of the vulnerability is when copying from src to data, the length of data(state.data\_size) is not taken into consideration of. This may cause EoP when using json.h as incoming json data parser.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched by the maintainer in this commit:

[sheredom/json.h@692679a](https://github.com/sheredom/json.h/commit/692679a34c1957db47ebd6852a76c8cfca4a56e4)

### Workarounds

N/A

### References

The input to trigger this bug is attached. The first 8 bytes are the flags for `json_parse_ex()` and the rest is the content(src). Please use address sanitizer to reproduce the bug, as non-crash overflow is hard to detect or locate without shadow memory.

Also, you can always use the code below to reproduce the vulnerabilities I reported(and I won't attach it in each report for simplicity:

```
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "json.h"

#define BUFF_SIZE 0x1000

int main(int argc, char** argv){
    if(argc != 2){
        printf("Wrong number of arguments\n");
        exit(0);
    }

    char data[BUFF_SIZE];
    FILE *f = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    size_t size = fread(data, 1, BUFF_SIZE, f);

    if(size < sizeof(size_t)){
        // to short input, exit
        exit(0);
    }
    size_t flags = *((size_t *)data);

    printf("The flags is 0x%zx\n", flags);

    struct json_parse_result_s result;

    json_parse_ex(data + sizeof(size_t), size - sizeof(size_t), flags, NULL, NULL, &result);
}
```
