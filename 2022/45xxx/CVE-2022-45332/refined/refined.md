The provided content is related to CVE-2022-45332.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `decode_preR13_section_hdr` function within `decode_r11.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow due to a `strncpy` operation writing beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can cause a crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. The AddressSanitizer output shows a write of size 63 bytes at an address within a 442820362-byte region, indicating a buffer overflow.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted DWG file. The provided PoC is named `poc`, available at [https://github.com/iorra-cifer/Poc/blob/main/libredwg/heap-buffer-overflow?raw=true](https://github.com/iorra-cifer/Poc/blob/main/libredwg/heap-buffer-overflow?raw=true).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to supply a malicious DWG file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

The issue was found using fuzzing and has been fixed in the `smoke/gh524-fuzz-r11` branch with multiple commits referencing the issue. The vulnerability was triggered within the `decode_preR13_section_hdr` function at line 139 in `decode_r11.c`, which is called from `decode_preR13` and subsequently from the `dwg_decode` and `dwg_read_file` functions. The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow when `strncpy` writes beyond the allocated space.
