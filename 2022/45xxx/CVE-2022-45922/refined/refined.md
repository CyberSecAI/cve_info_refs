Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2022-45922:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A logic error exists in the cookie creation process within the request handler for a user-accessible function. This error results in the generation of a valid "AdminPwd" cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows a low-privilege user to obtain a valid "AdminPwd" cookie, granting them unauthorized access to administrator-level functionalities.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application's logic for creating the "AdminPwd" cookie is flawed, leading to the exposure of an administrator-level cookie to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass normal authentication and gain administrative privileges.
*   **Full System Control:** With an "AdminPwd" cookie, an attacker could potentially access unauthorized endpoints and perform administrative actions. This could lead to complete control over the affected system, data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack is carried out via HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **Specific Endpoint:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a request to a user-accessible function that handles cookie creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker requires a valid user account with minimal privileges on the affected OpenTextâ„¢ Extended ECM system.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable endpoint is accessed via the GET method.
*   Sending a request to `/OTCS/cs.exe?func=ll.KeepAliveSession` results in the server returning a new valid `AdminPwd` cookie in the `Set-Cookie` header.
*   The response also includes other JSON data and a new `LLCookie`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes the vulnerable versions (21.1 - 22.1), and the fixed version (22.4).
*   A proof-of-concept request and response are provided, although the PoC request is redacted in the `seclists.org` content.
*   The "AdminPwd" cookie can be used to access unauthorized endpoints.
