{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a stack overflow in the `/goform/AdvSetWrlsafeset` endpoint. The `mit_ssid_index` parameter is concatenated into a buffer using `sprintf` without any size checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow due to lack of size validation when using sprintf with the user supplied `mit_ssid_index` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The provided PoC shows that a long string passed as `mit_ssid_index` causes the router to crash. This vulnerability can potentially be exploited to gain a root shell on the router, by overwriting the return address.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/AdvSetWrlsafeset` endpoint with a crafted `mit_ssid_index` parameter. The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface and must be able to authenticate.  The provided PoC uses the default username and password (admin/admin)."
