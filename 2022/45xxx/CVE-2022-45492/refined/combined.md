# Heap Overflow in json.h(json\_parse\_number())

Moderate

[hyrathon](/hyrathon)
published
GHSA-r9wh-hxqh-3xq7
Dec 30, 2022

## Package

json.h

## Affected versions

before 692679a34c1957db47ebd6852a76c8cfca4a56e4

## Patched versions

## Description

Heap Overflow in json\_parse\_number()

In json\_parse\_number(), there is a heap out-of-bound write. The bug can be triggered with an invocation of json\_parse\_ex() with specific flags combination. The root cause of this vulnerability is that the parameter number transferred to json\_parse\_number() is not properly sanitized, and it is pointed to out-of-bound position assigned by upper layer function.

Here is the output of Google ASAN when the vulnerability is triggerred:

# The flags is 0x5fd6d79cd6247bff

The input to trigger this bug is attached. The first 8 bytes are the flags for json\_parse\_ex() and the rest is the content(src). Please use address sanitizer to reproduce the bug, as non-crash overflow is hard to detect or locate without shadow memory.

The bug can be triggered with an invocation of `json_parse_ex()` with specific flags combination. The root cause of this vulnerability is that the parameter `number` transferred to `json_parse_number()` is not properly sanitized, and it is pointed to out-of-bound position assigned by upper layer function.  Here is the output of Google ASAN when the vulnerability is triggerred:  ``` The flags is 0x5fd6d79cd6247bff ================================================================= ==5128==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x6140000001c0 at pc 0x560f532c646f bp 0x7ffc97871f80 sp 0x7ffc97871f78 WRITE of size 8 at 0x6140000001c0 thread T0     #0 0x560f532c646e in json_parse_number /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1839:18     #1 0x560f532c22d1 in json_parse_value /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1980:7     #2 0x560f532c08f0 in json_parse_object /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1719:5     #3 0x560f532c11c8 in json_parse_value /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1940:5     #4 0x560f532c9c85 in json_parse_ex /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:2129:3     #5 0x560f532e0192 in main /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/fuzz.c:29:5     #6 0x7f65c9a20d8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16     #7 0x7f65c9a20e3f in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:392:3     #8 0x560f531ee314 in _start (/home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/san+0x33314) (BuildId: a0e983e1c9c38a8763824dc5481f79d22fe8c82a)  0x6140000001c4 is located 0 bytes to the right of 388-byte region [0x614000000040,0x6140000001c4) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x560f5327115e in __interceptor_malloc (/home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/san+0xb615e) (BuildId: a0e983e1c9c38a8763824dc5481f79d22fe8c82a)     #1 0x560f532c8f15 in json_parse_ex /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:2088:18     #2 0x560f532e0192 in main /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/fuzz.c:29:5     #3 0x7f65c9a20d8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /home/hyrathon/Desktop/jsonh/./json.h:1839:18 in json_parse_number Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c287fff7fe0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c287fff7ff0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c287fff8000: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c287fff8010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c287fff8020: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0c287fff8030: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[04]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c287fff8040: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c287fff8050: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c287fff8060: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c287fff8070: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c287fff8080: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb ==5128==ABORTING  ```  The input to trigger this bug is attached. The first 8 bytes are the flags for `json_parse_ex()` and the rest is the content(src). Please use address sanitizer to reproduce the bug, as non-crash overflow is hard to detect or locate without shadow memory.
