# KkFileView has XSS vulnerability

[![](/xiaojiangxl/paper/raw/main/kkFileView/img/1.png)](/xiaojiangxl/paper/blob/main/kkFileView/img/1.png)

After visiting the Web page, KKfileview project first selects the browse button to add relevant files, and then clicks the upload button.
The added file is a JSP file containing malicious JS statements. The contents of the file are as follows:

```
<html>
<title>test ip</title>
<body>
<script>
alert('x')
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

The request packet is as follows

```
POST /fileUpload HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.17.168:8012
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:105.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/105.0

```

[![](/xiaojiangxl/paper/raw/main/kkFileView/img/2.png)](/xiaojiangxl/paper/blob/main/kkFileView/img/2.png)

Then view the address of the uploaded file under the file name address `demo/x.jsp`

[![](/xiaojiangxl/paper/raw/main/kkFileView/img/3.png)](/xiaojiangxl/paper/blob/main/kkFileView/img/3.png)

The file can be accessed directly by concatenating the URL, and the malicious JS file can be executed

[![](/xiaojiangxl/paper/raw/main/kkFileView/img/4.png)](/xiaojiangxl/paper/blob/main/kkFileView/img/4.png)

View the `server\ src \main\ Java \cn\keking\web\controller\ Filecontroller.java`

[![](/xiaojiangxl/paper/raw/main/kkFileView/img/5.png)](/xiaojiangxl/paper/blob/main/kkFileView/img/5.png)

The reasons for this vulnerability are as follows:

1. The fileUpload method determines only the file name but not the contents of the file
2. The file upload path is not authenticated
