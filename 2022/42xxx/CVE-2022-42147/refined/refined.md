  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not validate the content of uploaded files, only the file name. Also, the file upload path is not authenticated.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Lack of file content validation",
    "Lack of upload path authentication",
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload malicious JSP files containing JavaScript code, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser when the uploaded file is accessed.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker uploads a malicious JSP file through the file upload functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to access the file upload functionality of the application."
