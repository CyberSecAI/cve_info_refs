- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attack complexity is low (AC:L), meaning that no specialized conditions are required to carry out the attack. The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) on the system, and user interaction is required (UI:R). The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low privileges and be able to trick a user into interacting with the malicious payload.
