- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The syngo Dynamics application server hosts a web service with an operation that has improper write access control. This allows for directory listing in any folder accessible to the account assigned to the websiteâ€™s application pool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically related to directory listing. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could obtain a directory listing of any folder accessible to the application pool's account, which could lead to further information disclosure and potential further attacks. The impact is rated as High for Integrity and Availability but None for Confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L), and no required privileges (PR:N). User interaction is not required (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web service. No specific privileges are required and no user interaction is needed.
