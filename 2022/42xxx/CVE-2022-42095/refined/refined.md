Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in Backdrop CMS version 1.23.0.
- It occurs due to insufficient sanitization/validation of user-supplied input when creating/editing page content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored within the "Page content," specifically in the "Body" input field.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or encode user input when the "Raw HTML" editor is selected. This allows the injected JavaScript to be executed when the page is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The XSS payload is executed immediately after saving the page with the malicious code.
- Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface of Backdrop CMS.
- The attacker navigates to Content > add content > Page.
- The attacker inserts the XSS payload into the "Body" field, choosing the "Raw HTML" editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with administrative privileges to add/edit page content.
- The attacker must be able to access the administrative interface of the Backdrop CMS instance.

- The provided payload is: `<img src=x onerror=confirm('Grim-The-Ripper-Team-by-SOSECURE-Thailand')>`
- This payload demonstrates an alert box upon execution, however, a malicious actor could use it to execute more harmful actions.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the "Grim The Ripper Team by SOSECURE Thailand".
- The vulnerability is triggered when the "Raw HTML" editor is selected, indicating a lack of proper handling of user-provided raw HTML.
