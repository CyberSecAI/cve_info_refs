  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2022-42916": {
      "status": "Relevant",
      "details": {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from curl's handling of Internationalized Domain Names (IDN). When a hostname in a URL uses IDN characters, which are then converted to ASCII counterparts, the HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) check could be bypassed. This bypass could lead curl to use an insecure HTTP connection instead of the expected HTTPS, even if HSTS is configured.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of IDN conversion",
          "HSTS bypass vulnerability"
        ],
        "Impact": "The impact of exploitation is that an attacker can force curl to communicate over HTTP even when HTTPS should be used. This could lead to eavesdropping and manipulation of data.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted URLs that use IDN characters to bypass the HSTS check.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to supply a URL with specific IDN characters to trigger the bypass."
