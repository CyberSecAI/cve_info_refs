{
  "CVE-2022-42004": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of a check in BeanDeserializerBase.deserializeFromArray to prevent use of deeply nested arrays during deserialization when the UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS feature is enabled.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Resource exhaustion due to lack of checks on deeply nested arrays.",
       "Denial of service (DoS)."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to resource exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted JSON input with deeply nested arrays.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide JSON data. Specific customized choices for deserialization in the application are required for the application to be vulnerable."
    , "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered only when the `UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS` feature is enabled and certain custom deserialization choices are made."
