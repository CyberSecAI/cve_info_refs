**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is related to vulnerabilities that exist when parsing various file formats within Autodesk products, specifically Design Review and AutoCAD. These vulnerabilities arise from improper handling of file structures, leading to memory corruption issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double Free
- Heap Overflow
- Out-of-bound Read/Write
- Use-After-Free
- Type Confusion
- Memory Corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, potentially allowing attackers to take control of the affected system. This could result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves maliciously crafted files (e.g., PDF, TIFF, TGA, PCX, PICT, RCL, BMP, PSD, DWF, PNG). Users are typically required to interact by opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
