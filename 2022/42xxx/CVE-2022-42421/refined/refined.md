Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42421

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF files within PDF-XChange Editor.
- Specifically, crafted data within a TIF file can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software attempts to write data beyond the designated memory boundary, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, which could allow them to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User interaction is required: The attacker needs to convince the victim to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious TIF file, which will be parsed by the PDF-XChange Editor application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious TIF file with crafted data designed to exploit the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- The attacker then needs to deliver the crafted TIF file or a link to it to the victim and induce the victim to interact with it.
