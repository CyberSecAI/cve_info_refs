* Severity: Critical

### Notes

This Security Advisory, VTS22-010, also addresses the issues identified in [VTS22-008](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/security/VTS22-008), which was released earlier. If you have not already applied [VTS22-008](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/security/VTS22-008), it is not necessary to apply it prior to installing this advisory. If you have already applied [VTS22-008](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/security/VTS22-008) you can safely apply VTS22-010 on top of it.
