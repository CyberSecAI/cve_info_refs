Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-42929:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox handles `window.print()` calls. Specifically, calling `window.print()` in a re-entrant manner, particularly within the `beforeprint` event listener, causes the browser to open new windows indefinitely.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue is the lack of proper handling of re-entrant `window.print()` calls, especially within the `beforeprint` event, which results in uncontrolled window creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A website can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- This denial of service can be persistent, potentially lasting beyond browser restarts, due to the user's session restore settings.
- The browser becomes unresponsive because of the continuous spawning of new windows which steal focus, leading to a degraded or unusable state. This can potentially lead to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious website that uses JavaScript to make re-entrant calls to `window.print()`, particularly within the `beforeprint` event listener.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to a Firefox user.
- The attacker must have the ability to execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- No special privileges or access is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered with the following code:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('beforeprint', (event) => {
    print()
});
print()
```
- The fix involves preventing re-entrant programmatic print calls and throwing an error when a tab-modal print is already open.
- This vulnerability was rated as "moderate" impact.
- The fix was included in Firefox 106 and Firefox ESR 102.4.
- The reporter of the bug was Andrei Enache.
