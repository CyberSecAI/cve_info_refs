Note:

\*\* If not free’ing FP\_ECC caches per thread by calling wc\_ecc\_fp\_free there is a possible memory leak during TLS 1.3 handshakes which use ECC. Users are urged to confirm they are free’ing FP\_ECC caches per thread if enabled to avoid this issue.

Release 5.5.0 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

## Vulnerabilities

* [Low] Fault injection attack on RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users doing operations with private ECC keys such as server side TLS connections and creating ECC signatures, who also have hardware that could be targeted with a sophisticated Rowhammer attack should update the version of wolfSSL and compile using the macro WOLFSSL\_CHECK\_SIG\_FAULTS. Thanks to Yarkin Doroz, Berk Sunar, Koksal Must, Caner Tol, and Kristi Rahman all affiliated with the Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report.
* [Low] In wolfSSL version 5.3.0 if compiled with --enable-session-ticket and the client has non-empty session cache, with TLS 1.2 there is the possibility of a man in the middle passing a large session ticket to the client and causing a crash due to an invalid free. There is also the potential for a malicious TLS 1.3 server to crash a client in a similar manner except in TLS 1.3 it is not susceptible to a man in the middle attack. Users on the client side with –enable-session-ticket compiled in and using wolfSSL version 5.3.0 should update their version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Max at Trail of Bits for the report and "LORIA, INRIA, France" for research on tlspuffin.
* [Low] If using wolfSSL\_clear to reset a WOLFSSL object (vs the normal wolfSSL\_free/wolfSSL\_new) it can result in runtime issues. This exists with builds using the wolfSSL compatibility layer (--enable-opnesslextra) and only when the application is making use of wolfSSL\_clear instead of SSL\_free/SSL\_new. In the case of a TLS 1.3 resumption, after continuing to use the WOLFSSH object after having called wolfSSL\_clear, an application could crash. It is suggested that users calling wolfSSL\_clear update the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Max at Trail of Bits for the report and "LORIA, INRIA, France" for research on tlspuffin.
* Potential DoS attack on DTLS 1.2. In the case of receiving a malicious plaintext handshake message at epoch 0 the connection will enter an error state reporting a duplicate message. This affects both server and client side. Users that have DTLS enabled and in use should update their version of wolfSSL to mitigate the potential for a DoS attack.

## New Feature Additions

* QUIC support added, for using wolfSSL with QUIC implementations like ngtcp2
* SE050 port additions and fixes
* Added support for Dilithium post quantum algorithm use with TLS
* Support for RSA-PSS signed certificates
* Support for Infineon AURIX IDE
* Add Zephyr support for nRF5340 with CryptoCell-312

## Enhancements

* Expanded ABI support by 50 APIs to include wolfCrypt and Certificates making a total of 113 ABIs controlled and maintained
* DTLS 1.3 partial support for ConnectionID as described by RFC9146 and RFC9147
* Added support for X509\_CRL\_print function
* Remove deprecated algorithms in Renesas cs+ project
* Support more build options disable/enable with i.MX CAAM build
* wolfSSL\_CTX\_set\_options and wolfSSL\_CTX\_get\_options functions added to non compatibility layer builds
* TFM: change inline x86 asm code to compile with clang
* Improvements to error queue and fix for behavior of wolfSSL\_ERR\_get\_error
* scripts/makedistsmall.sh script added for creating a small source/header only package
* TLS 1.3: restrict extension validity by message, Extensions ServerName, SupportedGroups and ALPN must not appear in server\_hello
* Add liboqs integration to CMake build system
* Adds wolfSSL\_PEM\_read\_RSAPrivateKey() to the OpenSSL compatible API
* Added support for P384 pre-share in bundled example server
* Replace clz assembly instruction in ARM 32 builds when not supported
* Integrate chacha20-poly1305 into the EVP interface
* Additional validation that extensions appear in correct messages
* Allow SAN to be critical with ASN template build
* Support wolfSSL\_CTX\_set1\_curves\_list being available when X25519 and/or X448 only defined
* Adds wolfSSL\_PEM\_read\_RSA\_PUBKEY() to the OpenSSL compatible API
* Match OpenSSL self signed error return with compatibility layer build
* Added wolfSSL\_dtls\_create\_peer and wolfSSL\_dtls\_free\_peer to help with Python and Go wrappers for DTLS

## Fixes

* DTLS 1.3 asynchronous use case fixes
* Fix handling of counter to support incrementing across all bytes in ARM crypto asm
* Fixes for ED25519/ED448 private key with public key export (RFC8410)
* Fix for build with NO\_TLS macro
* Fix for write dup function to copy over TLS version
* Fix to handle path lengths of 0 when checking certificate CA path lengths
* Fix for CMake not installing sp\_int.h for SP math all
* When WOLFSSL\_VALIDATE\_ECC\_IMPORT is defined ECC import validates private key value is less than order
* PSA crypto fixes
* Fix for not having default pkcs7 signed attributes
* DTLS socket and timeout fixes
* SP int: exptmod ensure base is less than modulus
* Fix for AddPacketInfo with WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS to not pass encrypted TLS 1.3 handshake messages to callbacks
* Fix for sniffer to ensure the session was polled before trying to reprocess it
