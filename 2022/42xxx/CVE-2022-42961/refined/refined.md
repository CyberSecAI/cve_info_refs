The provided content is related to CVE-2022-42961, as it describes a vulnerability in wolfSSL related to fault injection attacks on ECC keys through Rowhammer.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Fault injection attack on RAM via Rowhammer

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Exposure of ECDSA private keys due to Rowhammer attacks targeting RAM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Disclosure of private ECC keys.
*   Compromise of server-side TLS connections or ECC signatures created using the exposed keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Sophisticated Rowhammer attack on the hardware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Attacker requires the ability to perform a Rowhammer attack on the hardware where wolfSSL is running and using private ECC keys.
*   The attacker needs to be sophisticated enough to target the RAM where private ECC keys are stored during cryptographic operations.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects users performing operations with private ECC keys such as server side TLS connections and creating ECC signatures.
*   The fix requires updating to a newer version of wolfSSL and compiling with the macro `WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS`.
*   The report was made by multiple researchers from the Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
