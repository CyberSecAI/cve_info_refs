Subject: CVE-2022-42889: Apache Commons Text prior to 1.10.0 allows RCE
 when applied to untrusted input due to insecure interpolation defaults

Severity: important

Description:

Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url" - load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons Text 1.10.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default.

Mitigation:

Upgrade to Apache Commons Text 1.10.0.

Internal reference: OXUIB-1795
Vulnerability type: CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.5-rev50, OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev29
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.5-rev51, OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev30
Discovery date: 2022-07-29
Solution date: 2022-10-21
Disclosure date: 2023-02-08
CVE: CVE-2022-37306
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Details:
XSS using "upsell" triggers. Non-alphanumeric content can be injected by the user as JS content for the "upsell"
module. As a result, the code will be executed during subsequent logins and opening the "Portal" application, enabling
a persistent cross-site scripting attack vector.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within the victims context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering
unwanted actions via the web interface (e.g. redirecting to a third-party site). To exploit this an attacker would
require temporary access to the users account or lure a user to a compromised account. No publicly available exploits
are known.

Solution:
We improved the allow-list sanitizing algorithm to deal with non-alphanumeric code.

CVE: CVE-2022-43696
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Details:
XSS using "upsell ads". HTML content can be injected by the user as JS content for the "upsell ads" module. As a
result, the code will be executed during subsequent logins and opening the "Portal" application, enabling a persistent
cross-site scripting attack vector.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within the victims context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering
unwanted actions via the web interface (e.g. redirecting to a third-party site). To exploit this an attacker would
require temporary access to the users account or lure a user to a compromised account. No publicly available exploits
are known.

Solution:
We improved the sanitization process for upsell ads.

CVE: CVE-2022-43697
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Details:
"Tracking" features can be used to inject arbitrary script code. In case activity tracking adapters are enabled but not
defined, users can use jslob to define own tracking settings for an account. This allows adding arbitrary values to
trigger a specific URL or load a library.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within the victims context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering
unwanted actions via the web interface (e.g. redirecting to a third-party site). To exploit this an attacker would
require temporary access to the users account or lure a user to a compromised account. No publicly available exploits
are known.

Solution:
We made the related jslob configuration endpoint read-only for users.

Internal reference: MWB-1823
Vulnerability type: CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.5-rev50, OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev29
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.5-rev51, OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev30
Discovery date: 2022-09-14
Solution date: 2022-10-24
Disclosure date: 2023-02-08
CVE: CVE-2022-43698
CVSS: 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Details:
SSRF using POP3 account updates. When changing a valid external POP3 mail account as a user, the operation to update
the accounts settings did not consider deny-list values.

Risk:
Server-initiated requests can be directed to internal resources that are restricted based on deny-list settings. This
can be used to determine "internal" addresses and services, depending on measurement and content of error responses.
While no data of such services can be exfiltrated, the risk is a violation of perimeter based security policies. No
publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We now check compliance with existing deny-list content when updating POP3 mail accounts.

Vulnerability type: CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.5-rev50, OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev29
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.5-rev51, OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev30
Discovery date: 2022-10-06

CVE: CVE-2022-43699
CVSS: 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Details:
Mail account discovery can be abused for SSRF. The external E-Mail autodiscovery feature performs connections checks
based on the E-Mail addresses host-part. Those do not take existing deny-lists into respect, allowing attackers with
access to DNS records of a domain to redirect requests to illegal addresses.

Risk:
Server-initiated requests can be directed to internal resources that are restricted based on deny-list settings. This
can be used to determine "internal" addresses and services, depending on measurement and content of error responses.
While no data of such services can be exfiltrated, the risk is a violation of perimeter based security policies. No
publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We check for compliance with existing deny-list content when performing mail account autodiscovery.

CVE: CVE-2022-42889
CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Details:
Apache Commons Text Update. A critical vulnerability at the Apache Commons Text library has been identified, which is
used by OX App Suite and OX Documents. However, our products do not directly use the vulnerable StringSubstitutor
class. Based on current knowledge that means our products are not vulnerable.

Risk:
Remote Code Execution, see CVE-2022-42889. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We provided a update for this library to resolve the risk as a precaution, in case custom implementations use the
vulnerable class.

# Apache Commons Text: Arbitrary Code Execution — GLSA **202301-05**

A vulnerability has been discovered in Apache Commons Text which could result in arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/commons-text** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.10.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.10.0** |

### Background

Apache Commons Text is a library focused on algorithms working on strings.

### Description

Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. The set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url" - load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used.

### Impact

Crafted input to Apache Commons Text could trigger remote code execution.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache Commons Text users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/commons-text-1.10.0"

```
