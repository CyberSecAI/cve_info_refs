{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw exists in Xenstore's handling of node ownership after a domain is removed. When a domain is removed, its Xenstore nodes are transferred to Dom0. Malicious guests can exploit this by having one guest write nodes into another's Xenstore tree and then rebooting. This causes Dom0 to take ownership of these nodes, bypassing Xenstore quotas.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient restriction on Xenstore node creation and ownership transfer to Dom0.",
      "Lack of proper limits on Dom0's Xenstore node usage, allowing unlimited node creation"
    ],
    "impact": "Two malicious guests can collaborate to create an excessive number of Xenstore nodes, leading to an out-of-memory condition in `xenstored`, causing a denial of service (DoS). This prevents the creation of new guests and modification of existing guest configurations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cooperating malicious guest domains."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability for one malicious guest domain to write to the Xenstore tree of another guest.",
        "Ability to reboot a malicious guest domain."
   ]
