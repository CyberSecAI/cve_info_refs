{
  "CVE-2022-42722": {
    "description": "For this, a P2P device is required. This is e.g. default behavior when running NetworkManager to the best of my knowledge. If there is no P2P device yet, it must be created for the reproduction: Running the PoC leads to a null-ptr-dereference and thus to a DoS:",
    "root_cause": "If beacon protection is active but the beacon cannot be decrypted or is otherwise malformed, a cfg80211 API is called to report to userspace. However, this API uses a netdev pointer which is not present for P2P devices, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Null-pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
    "attack_vector": "Sending malformed 802.11 Beacon frames to a system with a P2P device active.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to inject malformed WLAN frames. This can be achieved through the air. It was tested using mac80211_hwsim but is expected to be driver-independent."
