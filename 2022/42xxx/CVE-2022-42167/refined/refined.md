- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `firewall_value` parameter from the `/goform/SetFirewallCfg` endpoint is copied to `firewall_buf` using `strcpy` without any size checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to the unchecked copy of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The stack overflow can lead to a denial of service (router crash). The provided text indicates that a root shell could be obtained, but no further details are given.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/SetFirewallCfg` with a large value for `firewallEn`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, typically requiring access to the local network where the router is connected.
