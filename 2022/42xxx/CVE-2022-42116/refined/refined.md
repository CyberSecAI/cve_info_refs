Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42116

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when integrating with CKEditor in Liferay Portal's Frontend Editor module. Specifically, the `name` and `namespace` parameters are vulnerable to reflected XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   Lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of the `name` and `namespace` parameters when passed to CKEditor integration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
*   This injected script can be executed within the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing user credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `name` or `namespace` parameter.
*   The victim clicks on the malicious URL.
*   The vulnerable application fails to sanitize the input and reflects the malicious script back to the victim's browser, where it executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link.
*   No prior authentication is required (as per the CVSS vector).
*   The attacker can be remote.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Liferay Portal 7.3.2 - 7.3.7
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.0 - 7.4.3.14

**Fixed Versions:**
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.15
*   No fix is available for 7.3.x version and it needs to be upgraded to 7.4.x

**Additional Notes:**
*   The CVSS score is 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating a medium severity vulnerability
