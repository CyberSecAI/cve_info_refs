  "CVE-2022-42725": {
    "Description": "Warpinator is vulnerable to a remote file creation/overwrite issue. The application trusts the remote Warpinator instance regarding path names and other metadata that are transferred. This allows a malicious actor to overwrite arbitrary files on the victim's system via manipulated relative paths. The file information displayed in confirmation dialogs does not necessarily reflect what the peer is actually sending.",
    "Root cause": "Warpinator does not properly confine uploaded data to the configured upload directory and trusts the remote instance regarding path names and other metadata.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of file paths",
      "Lack of proper sanitization of received file metadata",
      "Reliance on a single line of defense."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can achieve full remote code execution in the context of the user account running Warpinator on the victim's system by overwriting critical files like .bashrc. They can also overwrite any other file under the user's control.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious Warpinator instance sends a file with a manipulated relative path (e.g., ../.bashrc).",
      "Social engineering attacks, where the attacker suggests to send a file using Warpinator, but actually overwrites arbitrary data."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
       "The attacker must be on the same network as the victim.",
      "The attacker must know the correct group code to interact with the victim. If the default 'Warpinator' group code is in use, this requirement is trivial.",
      "The attacker needs to be able to send files via the Warpinator protocol."
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The default group code of 'Warpinator' increases the risk of users being vulnerable. The \"Require approval when files would be overwritten\" setting is insufficient because the check happens before the path is verified. The vulnerability can work unattended if the \"Require approval before accepting files\" setting is disabled. The application also allows creating entire directory trees including symlinks."
