  "response": {
    "root_cause": "A data race occurred in the `ThirdPartyUtil` component when two workers simultaneously initialized their CacheStorage. The root cause is that `BaseDomain()` on a MozURL isn't thread-safe due to how the Rust implementation makes use of the ThirdPartyUtil XPCOM service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Data race in `ThirdPartyUtil` component",
      "Non-thread-safe usage of `ThirdPartyUtil` XPCOM service by the `BaseDomain()` function"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a crash due to memory corruption",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by creating two workers that simultaneously access the `caches` global variable, causing them to initialize their CacheStorage concurrently",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create web workers and execute JavaScript code within the browser's environment to trigger the data race."
