Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2022-42198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an insecure file upload vulnerability in the "Simple Exam Reviewer Management System" (ERMS) v1.0. Specifically, the user avatar upload functionality within the user list management section is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file type or content. This means that an attacker can upload arbitrary files.
*   **Lack of File Type Restriction:** The system does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, allowing for the upload of malicious files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This would allow them to take full control of the system, steal sensitive data, or use the server to launch attacks against other systems.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading an SVG file, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, which will be executed when a user views the uploaded content. This could lead to stealing of user sessions or redirecting to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the web interface of the ERMS application
*   An attacker needs to log in as a low-privileged user.
*   The attacker navigates to the user list page (`/admin/?page=user/list`).
*   The attacker edits any user and exploits the avatar upload function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account within the ERMS application, even a low-privileged one, to access the vulnerable page.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker must have access to the web interface of the ERMS application

**Summary of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is an unauthenticated file upload in the user avatar upload functionality that can be leveraged by a low privileged user. The lack of file type validation leads to remote code execution via a PHP file upload, and cross-site scripting via an SVG file upload.

**Additional Information:**

The vulnerability is located in the "User List" function, specifically when editing a user profile and changing the avatar picture.
