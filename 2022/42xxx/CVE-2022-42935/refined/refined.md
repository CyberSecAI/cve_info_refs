This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-42935, affecting various Autodesk products.

**CVE-2022-42935 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The root cause is a vulnerability in how Autodesk Design Review handles certain file types, leading to a potential double-free condition.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Double Free.
*  **Impact:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a maliciously crafted PDF file in affected versions of Autodesk Design Review. User interaction is required.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file and entice a user to open it.

**Summary of all vulnerabilities mentioned in the document:**

The advisory describes multiple vulnerabilities, including double frees, heap overflows, out-of-bounds read/writes, use-after-free, type confusion, and memory corruption issues affecting various Autodesk products, such as:

*   **Autodesk Design Review:** Multiple vulnerabilities related to parsing various file formats (PDF, TIFF, PICT, TGA, DWF, PCX, RCL, BMP, PSD, PNG). These could lead to double frees, out-of-bounds reads/writes, use-after-free, and type confusion.
*   **AutoCAD:** Vulnerabilities related to parsing PICT, BMP, PSD, TIF, and TGA files, leading to buffer overflows and out-of-bounds read/write issues.
*   **Advance Steel and Civil 3D:** These products are also affected by the vulnerabilities present in the AutoCAD components they utilize.

**Overall Impact:**

The exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, potentially allowing attackers to gain control of affected systems.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

The document lists specific affected versions for:
*   AutoCAD (including specialized toolsets), Advance Steel, Civil 3D, and AutoCAD LT (2019-2023).
*   AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT for Mac (2022).
*  Autodesk Design Review (2018 and earlier).

**Mitigation:**

Autodesk recommends installing the latest updates for the affected software. Specifically, Autodesk Design Review users are advised to install a specific hotfix. For AutoCAD and related products, updates are available via the Autodesk Desktop App or Accounts Portal.
