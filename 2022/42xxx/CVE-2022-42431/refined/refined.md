- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a buffer within the bcmdhd driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. An attacker must first gain the ability to execute privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to execute privileged code on the target system.
