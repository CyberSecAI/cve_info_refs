## Description

Establish the connection between a B2B system and WooCommerce or WP-eCommerce stores. Use the ready connection to make synchronization of such client store information as products, categories, orders, and customers possible.

WHAT IS API2Cart?

[API2Cart](https://api2cart.com/) is a unified API to integrate with 40+ shopping carts and marketplaces including Magento, Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, Demandware, Amazon, and others.

We are also constantly expanding our list of platforms to meet the needs of our customers.

#### Experience the API2Cart Advantage

* **Seamless Integration:** Integrate seamlessly with WooCommerce and eliminate the hassle of managing multiple platforms.
* **Unified API:** Manage 40+ shopping carts and marketplaces with a single API.
* **Comprehensive Data Management:** Easily retrieve, add, delete, update, and synchronize store data such as orders, customers, products, baskets, and categories from all or any of the supported platforms. See [all methods and platforms](https://api2cart.com/supported-api-methods/) we support.
* **Developer-Friendly Tools:** Utilize our [SDK](https://api2cart.com/docs/sdk/) and [detailed documentation](https://api2cart.com/docs/) to connect multiple shopping carts and marketplaces with ease.

The plugin allows to set up the connection between B2B software such as inventory and order management systems, mobile app building software, e-mail marketing services, etc. and WooCommerce or WP-eCommerce stores in order to retrieve, synchronize and manipulate various store data such as orders, products, categories, prices, customers, abandoned carts, tracking numbers, etc.

#### Key Features

* establishes a secure link with WooCommerce stores
* enables to access store databases to get, add, delete, and synchronize such data as products, categories, customers, and orders
* makes it possible to use this data to do the following:
  + automate accounting, billing, inventory and order management, and other business processes
  + track inventory, order, and other data updates
  + create informative reports, widgets, and dashboards
  + organize invoices and shipping labels
  + create data feeds and send them multichannel
  + reflect information and its updates into mobile stores, social pages, and international listings
  + collect data on abandoned carts and send recovery e-mails
  + send notifications
* 32-symbol key security
* no client FTP credentials needed

*Supported WooCommerce versions:* 2.8.1 – 6.x.x

**Please note.** Having the plugin installed is not enough to get and manipulate store data. It only serves as a connector that works via API2Cart, which is a service that provides unified access to the databases of WooCommerce and 30+ other shopping carts.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
