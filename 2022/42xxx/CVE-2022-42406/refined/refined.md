Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of EMF (Enhanced Metafile) files within PDF-XChange Editor. Specifically, crafted data within an EMF file can cause the software to read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read due to improper handling of EMF file data, which allows access to memory outside the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the memory.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** While not directly achievable through this vulnerability, the advisory mentions that it can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious file:** An attacker can craft a malicious EMF file and deliver it to the target.
*   **Malicious webpage:** A malicious webpage could also be used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   **Local or Remote:** The attack can be initiated locally or remotely as long as the user interacts with the malicious file or webpage.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   PDF-XChange has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 3.3 with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating a low severity.
