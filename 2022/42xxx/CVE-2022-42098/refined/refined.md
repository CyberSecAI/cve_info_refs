Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `profile.php` file of the KLiK-SocialMediaWebsite version 1.0.1. The `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter in `profile.php`), allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.
*   Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization: The application does not implement sufficient input validation or sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, personal data)
    *   Data modification: Altering or deleting data in the database.
    *   Authentication bypass: Potentially manipulating user accounts
    *   Denial of service: Disrupting the application's functionality by crashing the database.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the HTTP GET request to `profile.php` using the `id` parameter, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically the `id` parameter in the URL:
    `http://ip_address/KLiK/profile.php?id=user_id`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the `profile.php` page with a crafted `id` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify web requests, for example using Burp Suite.
*   The attacker must know how to construct SQL injection payloads
*   The attacker must know the structure of the database to inject appropriate queries.
*   The attacker needs to have access to the KLiK Users page which requires having a user account.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query SQL injection techniques.
*   Example payloads include:
    *   `id=27 AND 3227=3227` (boolean-based blind)
    *   `id=27 AND (SELECT 3046 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))barN)` (time-based blind)
    *   `id=-2373 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x71787a7171,0x6d67676474624545784f564265735871415865575a4f72697053686d724768624969514c70754459,0x717a707071),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL#` (UNION query)

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Grim The Ripper Team by SOSECURE Thailand.
*   The vulnerability affects KLiK-SocialMediaWebsite version 1.0.1.
