The provided document contains details regarding multiple CVEs, including CVE-2022-42284.

**CVE-2022-42284**

*   **Root Cause:** The NVIDIA BMC stores user passwords in an obfuscated form within a database that is accessible by the host.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure storage of user credentials. While obfuscated, the passwords are not properly secured, leading to exposure.
*  **Impact:** Exposure of user credentials. An attacker gaining access to the database can potentially retrieve the obfuscated passwords, which may then be used to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A local attacker with access to the host can access the database.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have local access to the host system. No specific privileges are mentioned, but access to the filesystem is required.
