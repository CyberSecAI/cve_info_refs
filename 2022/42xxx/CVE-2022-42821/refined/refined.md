Root cause of vulnerability: A logic issue in BOM (Bill of Materials) handling.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Improper checks in BOM processing allows bypassing Gatekeeper.
Impact of exploitation: An application can bypass Gatekeeper checks.
Attack vectors: Malicious applications exploiting flawed BOM processing.
Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to craft a malicious app package that exploits the BOM logic flaw.
