The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC10 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint. Specifically, the `set_device_name` function uses `sprintf` to copy the `dev_name` into `mib_vlaue` without any size checks. The `dev_name` comes from the user-controlled `deviceName` parameter in the POST request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to lack of bounds checking when copying a user-controlled string into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The overflow can lead to a crash of the router.
- More importantly, the vulnerability could be exploited to achieve remote code execution and gain a root shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint.
- The `deviceName` parameter within the POST request contains the overflow payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router, which means they must be on the same network as the router, or have some way to access its web interface.
- The attacker needs to know that the router is a Tenda AC10, and they need to know the vulnerable firmware version is installed.
