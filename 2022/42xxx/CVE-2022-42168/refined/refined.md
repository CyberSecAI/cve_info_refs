Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/goform/SetIpMacBind` endpoint of the Tenda AC10 router's firmware. The `static_list` parameter is directly copied to a buffer (`mib_buf`) using `strcpy` without any size check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The lack of a size check when copying the user-controlled `static_list` input using `strcpy` allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Router Crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause the router to crash.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The content states that an exploit could be crafted to gain a root shell. This indicates the possibility of arbitrary code execution, providing complete control over the device to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetIpMacBind` endpoint.
- **`static_list` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `static_list` within the POST request body. By sending a value larger than the buffer allocated on the stack, an attacker can cause the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the router's web interface (typically LAN access, but could be WAN if remote management is enabled).
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter:** The attacker needs to know to target the `/goform/SetIpMacBind` endpoint and the `static_list` parameter.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The content provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit script in Python, demonstrating how the overflow is triggered by sending a long string as the `static_list` parameter.
- The content explicitly mentions the affected firmware version: Tenda AC10V15.03.06.23.
- The `strcpy` function is identified as the function with the vulnerability.
- It's mentioned the ability to achieve root shell by crafting an exploit.
