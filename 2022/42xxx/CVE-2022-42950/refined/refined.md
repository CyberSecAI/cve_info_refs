Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42950:

**CVE-2022-42950**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** An unbounded or extremely large HTTP request body sent to the backup service REST API can cause an out-of-memory (OOM) error.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The backup service does not properly handle or validate the size of incoming HTTP request bodies, leading to a potential resource exhaustion vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack can lead to a denial of service (DoS) of the backup service due to an OOM error. This could prevent the backup service from functioning properly, thus disrupting backup operations.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with an extremely large body to the backup service's REST API.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires network access to the Couchbase server and the ability to send HTTP requests to the backup service. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required to trigger the vulnerability, but the ability to reach the backup service's REST API is necessary.
