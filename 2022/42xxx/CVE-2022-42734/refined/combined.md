**Web Vulnerabilities in syngo Dynamics before VA40G HF01**

Publication Date: 2022-11-17
Last Update: 2022-11-17
Current Version: V1.0
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.1

**SUMMARY**

Web services in the syngo Dynamics server before version VA40G HF01 are impacted by multiple vulnerabilities that could allow Man-in-the-Middle attacks, leaking NTLM credentials and to read/write data to the local file system.
Note: The vulnerable web services are not intended to be exposed to the Internet. The Internet facing Web Portal part of the syngo Dynamics is not affected by the vulnerabilities.
Siemens Healthineers has released an update for the syngo Dynamics and recommends to update to the latest version.

| Affected Product and Versions | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| syngo Dynamics:All versions < VA40G HF01 | Update to VA40G HF01 or later versionContact your local Siemens Healthineers CustomerService Engineer, portal or our RegionalSupport Center. To find your local contact, pleaserefer to [https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/how-can-we-help-you/](/en-us/how-can-we-help-you)See further recommendations from section Workarounds and Mitigations |

**WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS**

Siemens Healthineers has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* The web services should never be exposed to the Internet (except Web Portal layer)
* Access to the application server should be limited to only those nodes that require syngo Dynamics functionality

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
**Please follow the General Security Recommendations.**

**GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS**

In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends the following:

* Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.
* Securely delete any backup files that are no longer needed.
* For speciﬁc patch and remediation guidance information contact your local Siemens Healthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center. To ﬁnd your local contact, please refer to [https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/how-can-we-help-you](/en-us/how-can-we-help-you)

**PRODUCT DESCRIPTION**

syngo Dynamics Cardiovascular Imaging and Information System (CVIS) is used for the acceptance,
transfer, display, storage, archive and manipulation of digital medical images, as well as quantification
and report generation. syngo Dynamics also provides the ability to manage patient information, order
entry, workflow management and business analytics.

**VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION**

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) (<https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/>). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.
An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at: <https://cwe.mitre.org/>.
