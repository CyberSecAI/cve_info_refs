Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `ArchivesMapper.xml` file of the Dreamer CMS. The vulnerability arises because the `${typeid}` parameter within an SQL query is not properly sanitized or parameterized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the unsafe use of `${typeid}` in the SQL query. This allows attackers to manipulate the query structure and execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, modify existing data, or even delete data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In certain database configurations, successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to elevate privileges within the database system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** It's possible that crafted SQL injection payloads could cause the database to slow down or crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface/Application:** The attack vector is likely the web interface of Dreamer CMS, where user input is used to construct the vulnerable SQL query. The exact location is not specified within the provided data but is implied to be where the `typeid` parameter is used by the application.
- **Malicious Input:** Attackers would need to supply malicious data through a parameter that eventually populates the `${typeid}` in the vulnerable `ArchivesMapper.xml` query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Application Interface:** Attackers require access to the web interface of the Dreamer CMS that allows manipulation of the `typeid` parameter.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** Attackers require knowledge of SQL to craft malicious payloads that can exploit the injection vulnerability.
- **No authentication required:** Based on the context, it does not appear that authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported on 2022-10-02 and the issue is marked as resolved in the provided content.
- It is explicitly mentioned that `${typeid}` should be "changeless" (i.e., not dynamically injectable). This highlights the developers' awareness of the problematic code structure.
