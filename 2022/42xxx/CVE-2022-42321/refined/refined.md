{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2022-42321",
  "description": "Xenstore: Guests can crash xenstored via exhausting the stack",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Xenstored uses recursion for certain Xenstore operations, such as deleting a sub-tree of nodes. Deeply nested Xenstore nodes can cause stack exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Recursive function calls without proper depth limits can lead to stack overflow."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest can crash xenstored, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) of Xenstore, which inhibits the creation of new guests or modifying the configuration of running guests.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious guest creates a deeply nested structure of Xenstore nodes."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious guest with the ability to create and manipulate Xenstore nodes."
  }
}
