Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an SQL Injection flaw in the login functionality of the "Merchandise Online Store System". The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in an SQL query, allowing for manipulation of the query's logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the username and password login fields. Specifically, the login form does not sanitize input before using it in a SQL query

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the admin account.
- **Complete Control:** Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control over the application, including the ability to view, modify, or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is the admin login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to the login page of the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to input text into the username/password fields.
- No special privileges or positioning are needed.

**Technical Details**
- The attacker can use the following payload in the username/password field: `admin' or 1=1`. This bypasses the authentication check and logs the attacker in as admin.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full control over the application.
