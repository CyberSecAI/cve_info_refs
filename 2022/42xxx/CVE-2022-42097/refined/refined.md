Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42097

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the comment functionality of Backdrop CMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via user comments and stored within the application's database. This payload will then be executed when the comment is viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected comments. This can lead to:
     - Session hijacking.
     - User redirection to malicious websites.
     - Defacement of the website.
     - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
