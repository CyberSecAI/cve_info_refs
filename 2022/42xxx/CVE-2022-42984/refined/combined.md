##### Brockied

Very impressed with the script it was easy to install and looks clean. Support was super quick! I have tried other social network scripts before, some that cost over $200 but this has to be the cleanest and most user friendly I have used. Look forward to see what new features come, can only expect good stuff from this script. I recommend 100% take my word just buy it you wont be disappointed.

I have purchased two scripts from Doug and all I can say is that both the quality of code and the quality of service is superb. I have no problem recommending this script (WoWonder) or the Playtube script.
