The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the "Online Tours & Travels Management System v1.0" by mayuri_k.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload functionality in the `admin/operations/update_settings.php` file, which allows arbitrary file uploads without proper sanitization or restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files with any extension, including executable PHP files.
- **Lack of File Extension Validation:** The system doesn't check or restrict the file extension of uploaded files.
- **Direct File Access:** Uploaded files can be directly accessed via the web browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file containing arbitrary code and execute it on the server, leading to full system compromise.
- **Complete system takeover:** With the ability to execute arbitrary code, an attacker can gain complete control of the server, steal sensitive data, and perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `update_settings.php` endpoint, including a malicious PHP file as one of the parameters (`logo_image`).
- **Multipart Form Data:** The request uses `multipart/form-data` encoding to send the file upload along with other parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the admin panel:** The attacker needs access to the administrative panel of the "Online Tours & Travels Management System", which can be achieved using the default credentials (mayuri.infospace@gmail.com/admin) as indicated in the report or by exploiting another vulnerability that could lead to admin access.
- **Network access to the vulnerable application:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
