SSA-844582: Electromagnetic Fault Injection in LOGO! V8.3 BM
Devices Results in Broken LOGO! V8.3 Product CA

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.6

2023-12-12
2024-10-08
V1.2

SUMMARY

LOGO! V8.3 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants) devices contain a vulnerability that could allow an electromagnetic
fault injection. This could allow an attacker to dump and debug the firmware, including the manipulation
of memory. Further actions could allow to inject public keys of custom created key pairs which are then
signed by the LOGO! V8.3 Product CA.

The vulnerability is related to the specific hardware architecture of the LOGO! V8.3 BM. Siemens has
released new hardware versions with the LOGO! V8.4 BM and the SIPLUS LOGO! V8.4 BM product
families for all affected devices in which the vulnerability is fixed and the Product CA private key is rotated.
See the chapter “Additional Information” below for more details.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Use HTTPS communication only in trusted networks without unknown network devices
• If possible, connect the Base Module directly with LOGO! Soft Comfort and the Web Browser

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siemens LOGO! BM (Base Module) devices are used for basic small-scale automation tasks.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-42784

Affected devices are vulnerable to an electromagnetic fault injection. This could allow an attacker to
dump and debug the firmware, including the manipulation of memory. Further actions could allow to
inject public keys of custom created key pairs which are then signed by the product CA. The generation
of a custom certificate allows communication with, and impersonation of, any device of the same version.
