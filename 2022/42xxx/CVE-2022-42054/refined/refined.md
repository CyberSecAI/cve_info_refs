{
  "CVE-2022-42054": {
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Company' and 'Description' fields within the 'Group Lists' panel of the cloud management interface.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking and account takeover, especially in enterprise/business accounts with 'Sub Account' features.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker creates a malicious group with XSS payloads in the 'Company' and 'Description' fields and then invites a victim user to join this group. When the victim logs in or switches to an organization where the malicious group is present, the XSS payload is executed.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid user account on the cloud management platform and the ability to create groups. For an account takeover, an enterprise account is needed to invite a victim through 'Sub Accounts'. The attacker needs to know the user ID of the victim they are targeting to send a sharing invitation."
