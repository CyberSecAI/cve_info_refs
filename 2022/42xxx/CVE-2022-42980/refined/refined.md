Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded JWT secret key (`go admin`) used in the go-admin project. Although the configuration file suggests modifying the token, many users fail to do so, leaving the default key in place, even in production environments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Secret:** The primary vulnerability is the use of the default, hardcoded JWT secret key.
*   **Lack of Enforcement:** The software doesn't enforce users to change the default secret key, allowing the insecure default to persist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can craft valid JWT tokens using the known secret key.
*   **Unauthorized API Access:** With a valid JWT, attackers can bypass authentication and access API endpoints.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can potentially add users with administrator privileges through exposed API endpoints.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exposed through the application's API, accessible via network requests.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker needs to know the API endpoints, and then use the hardcoded secret to forge tokens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of the JWT Secret Key:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the hardcoded secret (`go admin`).
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network connectivity to access the application's API.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The issue was reported and fixed by forcing random UUIDs for JWT keys.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker could generate valid JWTs and access sensitive information using the default key.
*   The issue highlights the importance of not using default secret keys and enforcing secure configurations.
