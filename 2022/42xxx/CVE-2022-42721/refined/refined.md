{
  "CVE-2022-42721": {
    "Root cause": "A non-transmitted BSS sharing both SSID and BSSID with another non-transmitted BSS from a different AP can cause list corruption when it is updated and added to the non-transmitted BSS list. A search for the BSS on the transmitted BSS list may not find it, leading to the corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "BSS list corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to an endless loop caused by the list corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "A crafted Wi-Fi beacon frame with specific SSID and BSSID information.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to send a crafted Wi-Fi beacon frame within the range of the vulnerable device."
