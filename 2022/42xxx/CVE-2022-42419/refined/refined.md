**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42419

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF files within PDF-XChange Editor. Specifically, crafted data within a TIF file can lead to a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software attempts to write data outside the designated memory region allocated for a buffer.

- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process running the PDF-XChange Editor. This could allow for complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious TIF File: The primary attack vector involves using a specially crafted TIF file.
- User Interaction: The user must open the malicious TIF file using the vulnerable software (PDF-XChange Editor) or visit a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious TIF file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious TIF file with PDF-XChange Editor, or visit a malicious page.
