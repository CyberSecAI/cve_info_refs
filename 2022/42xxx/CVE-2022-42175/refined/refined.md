Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper authorization checks in the SolusVM-WHMCS software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application allows users to manipulate the ID parameter in requests to access and modify resources (other customer servers) they are not authorized to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can change the password and hostname of other customer servers.
- This can lead to the attacker taking control of the target server.
- This may result in further harm to the customer's infrastructure.
- Potential compromise of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated attacker can send crafted requests to the server.
- The attacker needs to modify the ID parameter in the request to target another customer's server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the SolusVM-WHMCS application.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's request structure and the parameter used to identify servers.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects SolusVM-WHMCS version 4.1.2.
- It was fixed in version 4.2.0.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The vulnerability was discovered by researcher Kevin Coupal.
- The fix is available on the SolusVM security advisory github: <https://github.com/solusio/SolusVM-WHMCS-Module/releases/tag/v4.2.0>.
