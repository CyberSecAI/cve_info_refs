CVE-2022-42175 public reference

 [Raw](/mr404ntf/9c8728ee8f35d9744feec3828df1085d/raw/3f364d13abc5be0a765c21d4ecaad474365a0792/CVE-2022-42175.md)

[**CVE-2022-42175.md**](#file-cve-2022-42175-md)

CVE-2022-42175: Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability in 4.1.2 SolusVM-WHMCS allows an attacker to change the password and hostname of other customer servers without authorization.

The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper authorization checks in the SolusVM-WHMCS software. An attacker who is authenticated to the application can send requests to change the password and hostname of other customer servers by modifying the ID parameter in the request to reference the target server. This allows the attacker to take control of the target server and potentially cause further harm to the customer's infrastructure.

This vulnerability affects SolusVM-WHMCS 4.1.2 [fixed in the 4.2.0 version], and it can be exploited remotely by an authenticated attacker. A successful exploit could lead to unauthorized access to other customer servers and the potential compromise of sensitive data.

SolusVM recommends that customers apply the latest patch to their installation to mitigate this vulnerability. Additionally, customers should monitor their systems for unauthorized access and suspicious activity.

This CVE entry was assigned by Mitre, the organization responsible for assigning CVE identifiers and found by the researcher Kevin Coupal, For more information about this vulnerability, please refer to the SolusVM security advisory github: <https://github.com/solusio/SolusVM-WHMCS-Module/releases/tag/v4.2.0>.
