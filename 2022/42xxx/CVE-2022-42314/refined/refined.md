  "description": "Malicious guests can cause xenstored to allocate vast amounts of memory, eventually resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Multiple ways exist for guests to trigger large memory allocations in xenstored:\n\n  - Issuing new requests without reading responses, causing buffering.\n  - Generating numerous watch events through multiple watches and operations.\n  - Creating numerous nodes with max size and path length in many transactions.\n  - Accessing many nodes within a single transaction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled memory allocation",
       "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Unprivileged guests can cause a DoS of xenstored, preventing the creation of new guests or modification of running guest configurations.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Issuing numerous xenstore requests without reading responses.",
      "Setting up multiple xenstore watches and triggering events, e.g., by deleting nodes.",
      "Creating numerous nodes with max size and path length in many transactions.",
      "Accessing many nodes inside a transaction."
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "An unprivileged guest is sufficient for exploitation."
