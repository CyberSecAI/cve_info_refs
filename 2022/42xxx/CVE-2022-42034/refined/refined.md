The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Wedding Planner v1.0 application by pushpam02.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file upload vulnerability within the "users_profile.php" file, specifically during the profile picture update process. The application fails to properly validate the type and content of the uploaded file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without sufficient validation of the file type or content.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize the uploaded file, allowing execution of the PHP code embedded within it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file, which when accessed, executes arbitrary code on the server. This allows the attacker to gain control of the server, manipulate data, or cause other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/Wedding-Management-PHP/admin/users_profile.php` with a malicious PHP file disguised as a profile picture.
*  **File upload:** The file is uploaded to  `/Wedding-Management-PHP/admin/upload/users`
*   **Direct Access:** Once uploaded, the attacker directly accesses the malicious file through a web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the system to access the profile editing feature.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application server.
