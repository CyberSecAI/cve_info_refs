Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42413

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how PDF-XChange Editor parses JP2 files. Specifically, crafted data within a JP2 file can trigger a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data from a memory location outside the allocated buffer. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the application's memory.
- The advisory also mentions that this vulnerability, if combined with other vulnerabilities, could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This is a higher impact which the CVSS score does not account for.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves user interaction, requiring the target to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious JP2 file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious JP2 file that triggers the out-of-bounds read. They would need a way to deliver this file to the target either through a web page or by tricking the user into opening it directly.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in PDF-XChange Editor.
- A patch has been released by PDF-XChange to correct this vulnerability.
