- **Root cause of vulnerability:** DLL Search Order Hijacking
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The DWG TrueViewâ„¢ software is vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the application searches for DLLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution on the target system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL file in a directory that is searched by the application before the legitimate DLL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to write files to locations the application uses to search for DLLs. This typically requires some level of access to the system.
