Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-42292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NVContainer component of NVIDIA GeForce Experience. It stems from the ability of a user, without administrator privileges, to create a symbolic link to a file that requires elevated privileges for writing or modification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks on the creation of symbolic links by unprivileged users.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to manipulate files requiring elevated privileges via symbolic links can lead to unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Escalation of Privilege:** Exploitation may allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than intended.
- **Limited Data Tampering:** There is also a risk of limited data tampering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the target system.
- **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** An attacker creates a symbolic link to a file requiring elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User-Level Privileges:** The attacker needs to have user-level privileges on the system.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) to be successful as the vulnerability relies on the creation of the symbolic link.
- **High Attack Complexity (AC:H):** The attack has high complexity, suggesting that successful exploitation may require specific conditions or steps from the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as having a base score of 5.0 according to CVSS v3.1.
- The affected software is NVIDIA GeForce Experience on Windows.
- The fix is included in version 3.27.0.112 and later.
