- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks (AV:N), low attack complexity (AC:L), with low privileges required (PR:L), user interaction required (UI:R), scope changed (S:C).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs low privileges and needs to trick a user to interact with the malicious script.
