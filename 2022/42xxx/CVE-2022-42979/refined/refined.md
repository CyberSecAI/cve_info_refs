Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Ryde Android application's `SplashActivity` has an exported browsable activity that improperly validates the host in a deeplink URL. Specifically, it uses `.contains()` to check if the action contains `rydesharing.com` instead of a more secure method like checking for an exact match, leading to the bypass of the host check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Host Validation:** The use of `.contains()` for host validation allows an attacker to inject a malicious URL containing `rydesharing.com` as a substring, bypassing the intended host restriction.
*   **Arbitrary URL Loading in WebView:** The application loads the provided URL into a WebView, allowing an attacker to control the loaded URL.
*   **Session Token Leakage:** When the crafted URL contains `rydesharing.com`, the application appends the user's session token to the URL, potentially exposing the token to a malicious third-party server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** By capturing the leaked session token, an attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's Ryde account.
*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can control the URL loaded in the WebView, allowing them to send user information or other sensitive data to a malicious server by crafting a malicious link.
*   **Arbitrary Web Content:** The attacker can load arbitrary web content, potentially leading to further attacks like phishing or drive-by downloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Deeplink Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious deeplink URL that includes a manipulated host (containing `rydesharing.com` as a substring) and a malicious URL.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker creates a phishing website that includes a link using the crafted deeplink. When a victim clicks the link, it triggers the exploit within the Ryde app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft deeplinks:** The attacker needs to understand the Ryde app's deeplink structure and be able to create valid links.
*   **Ability to host a malicious server:** The attacker requires a server to receive the leaked session token, this can also be replaced with a service like a RequestBin to verify the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking the crafted deeplink via a phishing site.
