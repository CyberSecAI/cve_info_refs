  "CVE-2022-42466": {
    "Description": "Prior to 2.0.0-M9, it was possible for an end-user to set the value of an editable string property of a domain object to a value that would be rendered unchanged when the value was saved. In particular, the end-user could enter javascript or similar and this would be executed.",
    "Root cause": "The application was not properly escaping user-supplied input before rendering it in the web interface.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by inputting malicious JavaScript code into an editable string property of a domain object.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated end-user of the application."
