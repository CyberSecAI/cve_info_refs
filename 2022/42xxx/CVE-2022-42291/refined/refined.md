- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA GeForce Experience installer has a vulnerability where a user installing the software from a compromised directory may inadvertently delete data from a linked location.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Data tampering vulnerability in the installer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential data deletion and tampering.
- **Attack vectors**: Requires the user to explicitly launch the installer from a compromised directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to compromise a directory from which the user will launch the installer. The attacker does not have explicit control over the exploitation; it relies on user interaction.
