The provided content describes a file inclusion vulnerability in UCMS 1.6.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `include` function within `inc/func.php`, which uses a previously uploaded template file (`footer.php`) without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary code within the template.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file inclusion: The template management module allows the user to upload and include arbitrary files without adequate validation.
- Lack of sanitization: The uploaded `footer.php` file is not sanitized, allowing the attacker to embed malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By injecting shellcode into the `footer.php` file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
- Full system compromise: If the web server process has sufficient privileges, the attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Template management module: The vulnerability is exploited through the template management module of the UCMS system.
- File upload: The attacker uploads a malicious `footer.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the UCMS admin panel: The attacker needs to log in to the UCMS background/admin panel to modify the custom pages.
- Ability to add/modify templates: The attacker needs to be able to add a page and choose a custom template to upload the malicious file.
