- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on the `wowlan_config` data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-After-Free. The code attempts to access or operate on an object after it has been freed or deallocated.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker must already have the ability to execute privileged code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to have local access and the ability to execute privileged code on the target system.
