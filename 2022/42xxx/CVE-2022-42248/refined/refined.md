Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when creating interactive objects within the QlikView Ajax Client. Specifically, the application failed to adequately restrict allowed protocols during the creation of these objects. By crafting a malicious HTTP POST request, an attacker could inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, bypassing the intended protocol limitations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability, which arises due to the failure to properly sanitize user-controlled data before it is persisted and subsequently rendered in the application.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not adequately validate and sanitize the input provided during the creation of interactive objects.
- **Lack of Protocol Restrictions:** The application fails to enforce sufficient restrictions on allowed protocols within the user-provided input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session.
- **HTML Injection:** The attacker can inject malicious HTML, which could result in the modification of the page's appearance and/or behavior, potentially tricking users into revealing sensitive data or performing unwanted actions.
- **Data Theft:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker could steal sensitive information, such as session cookies or credentials.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session if session cookies can be obtained.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker could potentially modify the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attack involves crafting a malicious HTTP POST request targeting the interactive object creation functionality of the QlikView Ajax Client.
- **Injection of Malicious Payload:** Within the crafted HTTP POST request, an attacker injects a payload containing malicious web scripts or HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileged Access:** The attacker requires only low-privileged access (PR:L) to the application.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires a user to interact with the malicious payload (UI:R).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in QlikView versions 12.60 and below (including SR).
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.6 (High).
- The vulnerability is remediated in QlikView 12.70 SR2 and above.
