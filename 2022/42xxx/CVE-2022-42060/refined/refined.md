The provided content is related to CVE-2022-42060.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.
- It is caused by mismanaged memory allocation.
- The `setWanPppoe` function reads user input into variables without proper length checks.
- The `getPPPoEConnectStatus` function accepts the unchecked user input.
- Inside `getPPPoEConnectStatus`, the function `FUN_00447674` (renamed `CredentialCompareFunction`) stores user-provided input with `sprintf` to a char buffer, which overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Improper input validation.
- Mismanaged memory allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service. The router crashes and reboots in a perpetual cycle, rendering it unusable.
- Although not explicitly demonstrated, the vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, if a carefully crafted payload was created

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `/goform/module` function `setNetwork` in the "Internet Settings, Interface Types" application, specifically during Broadband Dialup configuration (PPPoE).
- The vulnerable parameters are `wanUser` and `wanPwd`.
- The attack can be performed through the local web interface and the hosted remote web management console.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the router's web interface.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the `wanPwd` parameter with a string longer than the buffer can hold.
