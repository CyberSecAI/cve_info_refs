Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in CandidATS version 3.0.0, specifically within the `ajax.php` file when handling URL parameters. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application reflects user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.
- Specifically, the `sortBy` parameter within the URL is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can steal the session cookie of a targeted user.
- This cookie theft can lead to account takeover, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the victim's account, including administrative accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable `sortBy` parameter.
- This URL needs to be delivered to the victim, often through social engineering techniques, such as phishing emails or malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to entice a user, such as an administrator, to click on the malicious link. This is achieved by social engineering, such as sending a crafted malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with JavaScript payload.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42747 is specifically assigned to the XSS vulnerability found in the `sortBy` parameter of the `ajax.php` file.
