The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the "Wedding Planner v1.0" application, specifically in the `photos_edit.php` file within the admin panel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file upload issue in the "Gallery" module's editing functionality, where there are no proper restrictions on file types, allowing an attacker to upload malicious PHP files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows uploading files without proper validation of the file type or content, allowing the upload of arbitrary files like PHP scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker uploads the malicious PHP file using a crafted HTTP POST request to `admin/photos_edit.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the admin panel of the "Wedding Planner v1.0" application.
- Ability to craft an HTTP POST request with a malicious PHP payload.
