- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in a user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, requiring a low privilege level and user interaction (user needs to click on a malicious link).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to inject malicious script into a vulnerable part of the AEM application. The attacker also needs to entice a user to interact with that malicious script (e.g. through a link).
