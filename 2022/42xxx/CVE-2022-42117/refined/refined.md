Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42117

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `label` attribute within the `<clay:label>` tag of the Frontend Taglib module in Liferay Portal. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where user-supplied input is reflected back to the user without proper sanitization, allowing the execution of malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious code into the `label` attribute of the `<clay:label>` tag.
- The attack is triggered when a user's browser renders the page containing the vulnerable tag with the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the `label` attribute of the `<clay:label>` tag.
- This can happen through methods like:
    - Crafting a malicious link that includes the payload.
    - Injecting the payload through another application that uses the affected component.
- User interaction is required (the victim needs to visit the crafted URL or interact with the manipulated page).

**Affected Versions:**
- Liferay Portal 7.3.2 - 7.3.7
- Liferay Portal 7.4.0 - 7.4.3.16

**Fixed Versions:**
- Liferay Portal 7.4.3.17
- There is no fix for Liferay Portal 7.3, users are advised to upgrade to Liferay Portal 7.4.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated with a severity of 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
