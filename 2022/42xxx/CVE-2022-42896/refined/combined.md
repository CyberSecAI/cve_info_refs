Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix accepting connection request for invalid SPSM

```
The Bluetooth spec states that the valid range for SPSM is from
0x0001-0x00ff so it is invalid to accept values outside of this range:

## Description

There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap\_core.c's l2cap\_connect and l2cap\_le\_connect\_req functions which may allow code execution and leaking kernel memory (respectively) remotely via Bluetooth. A remote attacker could execute code leaking kernel memory via Bluetooth if within proximity of the victim.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
