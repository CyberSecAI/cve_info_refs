{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because when a node is created and then deleted within the same transaction, the transaction is terminated with an error. However, this error is encountered only during transaction finalization, leading to a partial transaction execution without updating accounting information. This allows a malicious guest to create an arbitrary number of nodes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of errors during transaction finalization in Xenstore.",
      "Lack of proper accounting when a node is created and then deleted within the same transaction."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest can exploit this to cause a memory shortage in xenstored, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored. This inhibits the creation of new guests and changing configurations of existing ones.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious guest can create and delete nodes within the same transaction to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have control of a guest VM within the Xen hypervisor environment. Specifically, the attacker needs the capability to interact with Xenstore."
  },
  "affected_systems": "All systems running Xen version 4.9 and newer that use the C variant of Xenstore (xenstored or xenstore-stubdom) are affected. Systems using the Ocaml variant of Xenstore (oxenstored) are not vulnerable.",
