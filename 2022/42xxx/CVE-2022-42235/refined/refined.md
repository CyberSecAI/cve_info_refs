Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Student Clearance System's student registration form. Specifically, the "First Name" field does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it saves unsanitized JavaScript code into the database. When this data is later retrieved and displayed, the injected JavaScript code executes within the user's browser context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, which executes when other users view the affected data.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal session cookies, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate other users, including administrators. This is specifically mentioned in the provided exploit code: "We can use Admin cookie to escalate our privilege."
- **Privilege Escalation:** By stealing admin cookies, the attacker can gain full control of the application, potentially performing malicious actions like modifying data, creating new admin accounts, etc.
- **Data Manipulation/Theft**: The injected scripts can be used to modify or steal sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Student Registration Form:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "First Name" field when registering a new student through the admin interface at `http://victim.com/clearance/admin/students.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel to add/register students.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:**  The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft malicious scripts.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit code provided includes the following information:
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Student Clearance System v1.0
*   **Vendor:** beedyboy
*  **Payload:** `<script>confirm (document.cookie)</script>`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** Full Name (specifically "First Name" field in the student registration form)
*   **Steps to Reproduce:**  The provided steps outline exactly how to inject the XSS payload, save the student data, and then trigger the payload by viewing the list of students.

This confirms the vulnerability is a Stored XSS, with the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by exploiting the lack of sanitization on the student registration form.
