*   **Data Breach:**  Potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data within the Liferay Portal database.
*   **System Compromise:** Full compromise of the database and potentially the Liferay application server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted Payload:** The attack vector involves injecting a malicious SQL payload into the `title` field of a friendly URL during the upgrade process.
*   **Friendly URL Upgrade:**  The vulnerability is triggered during the upgrade of the Friendly URL module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged in user with at least low-level privileges.
*   **User interaction**: The attack requires user interaction as the vulnerability is triggered during an upgrade.
