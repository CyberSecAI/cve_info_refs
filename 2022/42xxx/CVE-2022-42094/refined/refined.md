Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the "Card" content type of Backdrop CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating "Card" content. Specifically, the "Body" field within the Card content type is vulnerable. By selecting the "Raw HTML" editor, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which will be stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view the page with the compromised card content.
- **Session Hijacking:** This can lead to session hijacking, where the attacker gains control of the victim's session.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially steal sensitive data, manipulate content, or redirect the user to malicious websites.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can use the XSS to spread malware to users.
- **Full Site Takeover:** If an administrator is the victim, the attacker can gain administrative control over the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered through user-supplied input in the "Body" field of the "Card" content type.
- **Raw HTML Editor:**  The vulnerability is triggered by choosing the "Raw HTML" editor for the "Body" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker must have an account with administrative privileges to create or edit "Card" content.
- **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be familiar with XSS payloads.
- **Access to the Backdrop CMS Interface:** The attacker must have access to the Backdrop CMS interface to create or modify card content.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Backdrop CMS version 1.23.0.
- The vulnerable URL is  `http://ip_address/backdrop/node/add/card`.
- The attack is performed via a POST request to `/backdrop/node/add/card`.
- The attacker injects the XSS payload into the "Body" field of the "Card" content using the "Raw HTML" editor.
- An example payload is: `<img src=x onerror=confirm('Grim-The-Ripper-Team-by-SOSECURE-Thailand')>`.
- The XSS payload executes immediately after the content is saved.

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-42094 describes a stored XSS vulnerability in Backdrop CMS version 1.23.0. An attacker with administrative access can inject malicious JavaScript code via the "Card" content's "Body" field, leading to arbitrary code execution in the browser of users who view that content.
