## Why use Backdrop CMS?

### Built-in upgrade from Drupal 7.

Backdrop has a built-in upgrade path from Drupal 7. [Backdrop is a great alternative for people with Drupal experience](/drupal-alternative) because it is so similar to Drupal, and it includes numerous usability improvements and new features.
### Serve pages fast, even on shared hosting.

Backdrop is lean and mean. With a commitment to performance, you can expect to see continued improvements in each version. Watch your pages fly!
### Add more functionality, quickly.

Browse and install add-ons directly from your own website. No need to scour the internet for available modules, themes, and layouts.
### Works great on phones & tablets.

Every Backdrop site is always responsive. Visitors enjoy a great mobile experience, and administrators can create and edit content from phones or tablets.
### Create and manage your own content.

Easily create content by formatting text and uploading images. It's not necessary to know web programming languages (or hire someone who does) to get your content on the web.
### Control access with permissions.

Different people can have different levels of access to your content. Use Backdrop's robust permission system to define roles that exactly match your needs.
### Customize everything, everywhere.

Need to add your own special touches? Backdrop has a robust API and can be modified in any number of ways with only a few lines of custom code.
### Security is a priority

Backdrop CMS was designed with robust security in mind. New security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly.
### Deploy changes easily.

### Backdrop CMS is free software.

[1.23.0](/backdrop/backdrop/tree/1.23.0)

[`b69b9e7`](/backdrop/backdrop/commit/b69b9e7cd9489456f17774e1f1abf9204bf5e24c)

The Backdrop community is proud to release version 1.23.0 of Backdrop CMS, following our 4-month release cycle.

**Notes for updating**

* No changes have been made to the `.htaccess`, `robots.txt` or default `settings.php` files in this release. Updating customized versions of those files is not necessary.
* **It will be necessary to run the update script** (located at /core/update.php) for this release.
* **This release includes an API Change.** While we try hard to maintain compatibility as much as possible between releases, this change was needed to facilitate the inclusion of Entity Reference module in core. Please see the change record [File::uri() Now Returns Path to File Entity Page, Not the File Path](https://docs.backdropcms.org/change-records/file-uri-now-returns-path-to-file-entity-page-not-the-file-path) for more information.

**Changes since version 1.22.3 are listed below.**

## Documentation updates

## User Experience Improvements

* Fixed: Don't convert fieldset to vertical tab if there is only one in the group. [#5747](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/5747)

## Miscellaneous changes
