The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-42490.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `m2m_parse_router_config` function in the Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD router does not properly sanitize input received via UDP packets before using it in a `system()` call. Specifically, the function parses data expecting a format like `<nvram_key_1>=<nvram_value_1>&<nvram_key_2>=<nvram_value_2>...` and constructs a command string like `nvram set <nvram_key>=<nvram_value>`. This string is then passed to `system()` without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The lack of input sanitization before calling `system()` allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands via the `nvram_value` field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the router's operating system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted UDP packets to the router's `m2m` service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the vulnerable router on the network where the `m2m` service is listening. No authentication is required.

**Details specific to CVE-2022-42490:**
- CVE-2022-42490 is specifically associated with the `DOWNLOAD_CFG_FILE` command within the `m2m` binary. When this command is received, the `m2m_parse_router_config` function is called, leading to the command injection vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered using the `UDP_data_buff.data` and `UDP_data_buff.data_len` from the incoming request.
