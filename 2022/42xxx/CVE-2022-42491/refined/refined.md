{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `m2m_parse_router_config` function does not sanitize input received from a UDP packet before using it in a `system` call.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS command injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the device. No authentication is required."
