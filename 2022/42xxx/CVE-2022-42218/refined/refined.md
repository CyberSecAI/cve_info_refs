The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Open Source SACCO Management System v1.0" by mayuri_k.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of `/sacco_shield/manage_loan.php` before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service. The provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract data by using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter. For example, `/sacco_shield/manage_loan.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10--+`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is strictly necessary for this specific SQL injection, although the provided document does provide credentials for an admin account.
