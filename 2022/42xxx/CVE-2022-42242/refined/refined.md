The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Simple Cold Storage Management System v1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `delete_booking` function within the `/csms/classes/Master.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
    - Access and modify sensitive data within the database.
    - Potentially gain control over the database server.
    - Leak database information such as the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP POST request to `/csms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_booking` by manipulating the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    - No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability remotely.

The provided exploit includes a payload example, showcasing the use of `updatexml` to extract the database name:

```
id=2' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+
```

This payload leverages a boolean-based SQL injection technique to retrieve the database name.
