Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42096:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue that arises from unsanitized user input within the "Post" content feature of Backdrop CMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: The application stores the malicious script provided by the attacker, which is then executed when other users view the affected content.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided content in the "Body" field of a Post before storing it in the database.
- Raw HTML editor: The vulnerability can be triggered when the user selects the "Raw HTML" editor, which indicates that the application is not sanitizing the HTML code entered by users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of a user's browser.
- Potential for session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious activities that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and user data.
- Defacement or modification of the application interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create or edit "Post" content in Backdrop CMS.
- The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Body" field of a "Post" and saves the content using the "Raw HTML" editor.
- When the post is viewed by another user or by an administrator, the stored XSS payload will be executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must have an account with sufficient privileges to create or edit "Post" content. Usually administrator privileges.
- Basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript to craft the malicious script.
