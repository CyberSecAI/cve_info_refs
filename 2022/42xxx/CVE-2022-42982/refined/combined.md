#### BKG Professional NtripCaster [*(Datasheet)*](/root_ftp/NTRIP/documentation/NtripCaster_Datasheet.pdf)

##### Application and Specifications

The BKG Professional NtripCaster allows the dissemination of GNSS real-time data streams via internet.
The software supports the Ntrip internet protocol in version 1 and 2. For more details on the Ntrip protocol,
please see [here](/ntrip).

The software has been developed within the framework of the EUREF-IP project. It is based on the ICECAST
Internet Radio software written in C programming language under GNU General Public License (GPL).
The caster is running on Linux systems and has been tested successfully on various distributions, such as Suse,
Debian, Gentoo, and Red Hat. The software supports more than 100 NtripServers and more than 2000 listening
NtripClients simultaneously. There are more than 100 operational installations worldwide. For technical details,
see the [manual](/root_ftp/NTRIP/software/caster/ntripcaster_manual.html) and [Changelog](/root_ftp/NTRIP/software/caster/CHANGES) for updates and security
fixes.

The caster does **NOT** support features known from legacy RTK services like Virtual Reference Station (VRS)
or selection of the nearest base station etc.
The software does not decode streams and has therefore no information about the streams' content.
For positioning purposes the caster can be used to distribute SSR correction streams, see [RTCM-SSR corrections](/ntrip#rtcm-corr).

##### Order and Delivery

The development and sale of the BKG Professional NtripCaster started 2004. Beginning on September 2024, the
product is distributed free of charge.
This includes delivery of the software including the source code in C programming language.
Installation or operation support is not included.

The software can be downloaded [here](/root_ftp/NTRIP/software/caster/).

# CVE-2022-42982 NTRIP UDP Amplification Vector

Certain NTRIP casters, such as BKG Caster 2.0.39 and earlier, will send large responses to unauthenticated requests over UDP.

This can be used as a vector for amplified DDoS attacks. It is recommended you configure your server in such a way that only authenticated streams are provided using the UDP protocol, while rejecting SOURCETABLE requests.

You can test your server by sending a UDP packet to it with the following payload: '0x80, 0x61, 0x04, 0xd2, 0x00, 0xbc, 0x61, 0x4e, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x47, 0x45, 0x54, 0x20, 0x2f, 0x20, 0x48, 0x54, 0x54, 0x50, 0x2f, 0x31, 0x2e, 0x31, 0x0d, 0x0a, 0x0d, 0x0a'. If you get a large response your configuration is vulnerable.

Please note that this example request is not entirely valid, as information such as the server hostname is not filled in. However, we have not seen any server that cares about this. If this is a problem for you, please refer to the NTRIPv2 standard on how to encode the payload.

We provide a small online tester which does generate a complete request below:
