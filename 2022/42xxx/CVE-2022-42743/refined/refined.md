Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42743

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `deep-parse-json` library, specifically version 1.0.2, fails to properly validate incoming JSON keys, allowing an attacker to modify or add properties to an object's prototype by injecting the `__proto__` property.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue. The library's lack of input sanitization allows the injection of the `__proto__` property into an object, which can be leveraged to modify the prototype of all objects inheriting from the polluted prototype.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify or add new properties to an object's prototype via the `__proto__` injection.
- This could potentially lead to various security issues including:
    - **Denial of Service:** By manipulating crucial properties, an attacker might cause the application to crash or become unusable.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** As demonstrated in the provided exploit, by modifying the `role` property, an attacker could escalate their privileges within the application.
    - **Data tampering:** Malicious modification of object properties can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior in the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote attack:**  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely. An attacker can send a malicious JSON payload containing the `__proto__` property to the `deepParseJson` function which would then parse it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed to the `deepParseJson` function, and this input should be in JSON format.
- No special privileges or authentication is needed, implying that this can be exploited by any user who can send input to the vulnerable application/function.

**Additional details:**

- The provided exploit code demonstrates how a malicious user request containing the `__proto__` key can overwrite properties on the prototype object.
- The vulnerability was discovered on 2022-10-06.
- No patch was available at the time of reporting.
