Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-42865:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the AppleMobileFileIntegrity component. The root cause is that an app is able to bypass Privacy preferences due to a lack of proper enforcement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is the lack of hardened runtime enforcement, which allows applications to bypass privacy settings. This means an application could potentially access resources or data that it should be restricted from.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit would allow an application to bypass the user's privacy preferences. This could lead to an app accessing sensitive information, performing actions without user consent, or potentially escalate to other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector would be a malicious application. It would exploit the lack of hardened runtime enforcement by circumventing the privacy preferences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to install and execute a malicious application on the target system. No specific user privileges are mentioned, but typical user permissions would likely be sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- macOS Big Sur
- tvOS 16.2
- iOS 16.2 and iPadOS 16.2
- watchOS 9.2
- macOS Ventura 13.1

**Resolution:** This issue was resolved by enabling hardened runtime.

This vulnerability is present across several Apple operating systems.
