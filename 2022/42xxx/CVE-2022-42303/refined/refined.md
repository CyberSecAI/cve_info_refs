Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-42303:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The NetBackup Primary server is vulnerable to a second-order SQL injection attack. This vulnerability is triggered by leveraging the first SQL injection vulnerability, CVE-2022-42302.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Second-order SQL injection vulnerability in the NBFSMCLIENT service. This means that malicious data is first stored and then used in a subsequent SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data, and ultimately compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the NetBackup server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attack requires high privileges on the affected server (PR:H) and a high level of complexity to exploit (AC:H).
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network access to the NetBackup Primary server.
    *   An attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) to exploit this vulnerability. The document specifies that this is achieved by leveraging Issue #1 (CVE-2022-42302).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects NetBackup Primary Servers with versions 10.0 and earlier.
