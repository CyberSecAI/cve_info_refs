{
  "CVE-2022-42719": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the mac80211 subsystem when parsing a multi-BSSID element. The vulnerability occurs because element pointers might point to the `nontransmitted_profile` which gets freed prematurely before the pointers are dereferenced.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution. A remote attacker can potentially crash the system or execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted WLAN frames containing a malformed multi-BSSID element.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within range to send the malicious WLAN frames."
