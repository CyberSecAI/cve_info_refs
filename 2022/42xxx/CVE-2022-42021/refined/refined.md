The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Best Student Result Management System" by mayuri_k.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `notice-details.php` file.
- The `nid` parameter in the URL is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries to bypass security measures.
- An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive data or modify database contents
- An attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution depending on the database type and configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject SQL code through the `nid` parameter in the URL.
- The vulnerable URL is `/upresult/upresult/notice-details.php?nid=`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable URL.
- No specific authentication is mentioned, suggesting it might be exploitable anonymously.

**Payload:**
- The provided payload `nid=2' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x61626364,0x31323334,0x71727374)-- -`  is used to test for SQL injection vulnerability.
