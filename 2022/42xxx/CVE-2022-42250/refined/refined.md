Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/csms/admin/inquiries/view_details.php` file. The application does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input to the `id` parameter. Specifically, it appears to be a form of error-based SQL injection using the `updatexml` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Leakage:** The provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract the database name, revealing sensitive information about the database structure.
- **Potential for Full Database Compromise:**  A successful SQL injection can lead to a full compromise of the database, allowing an attacker to read, modify, and delete any data. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, and other critical impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL.
- **URL Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the URL is the specific attack vector, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker requires a working knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** Although an admin user is mentioned, it's implied that this vulnerability can be exploited even without authentication as no authentication seems to be required to access the vulnerable endpoint.
