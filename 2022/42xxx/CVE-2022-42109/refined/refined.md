Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `p` parameter in the `product.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsanitized user-supplied input (`p` parameter) being directly incorporated into the SQL query.
- The application uses a GET request and the 'p' parameter to retrieve data for a specific product. However it does not sanitize or validate this parameter before including it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** An attacker can use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to the database, which can lead to data leakage, modification, or deletion.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive information stored in the database, such as user credentials, personal details, or financial information.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can be a stepping stone for further attacks, such as taking control of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/shopping/product.php` endpoint, with the malicious SQL injection in the `p` parameter.
- The vulnerable URL is: `http://[ip]/shopping/product.php?p=72` (The `72` can be replaced with the SQL payload)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL is required to craft the malicious injection payloads.
- **No prior Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the application.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload is a `UNION ALL` query, which helps in testing the number of columns returned by the original query and inject data in the select statement columns to retrieve information from the database.
- The payload provided is: `p=72 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x716b6a6271,0x61644f4c796848674f74444476795064457842697a416649624d78546f4152624f78644a77446867,0x7170707071),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -`
- This payload uses `CONCAT` to insert a test string into one of the returned columns.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in the `online-shopping-system-advanced` application and is located in `product.php`.
- The vulnerability can be easily tested using tools like sqlmap.
