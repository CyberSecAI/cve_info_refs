The provided content is related to CVE-2022-42058.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists due to the lack of proper input validation and memory allocation in the `advance_set_wan_access_cfg` function within the `netctrl` binary. The `remoteIP` parameter from the `/goform/module` function `setRemoteWebManage` in the `httpd` binary is passed to this vulnerable function. The input is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without checking the length which allows overflowing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- Improper input validation
- Mismanaged memory allocation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the router

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request with an overly large `remoteIp` parameter to the `/goform/module?go=setRemoteWebManage` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, either locally or remotely, which may require authentication for certain scenarios.
