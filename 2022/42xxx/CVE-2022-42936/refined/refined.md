This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting Autodesk products, including CVE-2022-42936.

**CVE-2022-42936 Details**

*   **Root Cause:** This vulnerability is related to memory corruption due to a maliciously crafted file when consumed by the application.
*   **Weakness:** Specifically, CVE-2022-42936 is tied to a use-after-free vulnerability that occurs while processing a PDF file within Autodesk Design Review. This is part of a group of vulnerabilities related to parsing various file formats, such as TGA, PICT, BMP, PSD and TIF.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious file (.PDF in this particular CVE case) with an affected Autodesk product.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious file that exploits the vulnerability. The user needs to open the malicious file on a system with the vulnerable software installed, meaning user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
