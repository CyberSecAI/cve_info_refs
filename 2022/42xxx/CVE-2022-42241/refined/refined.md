The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Simple Cold Storage Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `/csms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_message` file where the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input validation of the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can extract sensitive database information, including the database name.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/csms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_message` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request with a SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter. They need to know the location of the vulnerable file.
