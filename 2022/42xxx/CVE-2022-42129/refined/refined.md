Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42129

**Root Cause:** Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the Dynamic Data Mapping module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application exposes internal object references (specifically `formInstanceRecordId`) without proper authorization checks. This allows users to access resources by directly manipulating identifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Authenticated users can view and access form entries they shouldn't have access to by manipulating the `formInstanceRecordId` parameter.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the `formInstanceRecordId` parameter in HTTP requests to access unauthorized form entries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid authenticated user of the Liferay Portal.
*   **Knowledge of `formInstanceRecordId` structure:** The attacker needs to be able to guess or obtain valid `formInstanceRecordId` values in order to exploit the vulnerability

**Affected Versions:**
*   Liferay Portal 7.3.2 - 7.3.7
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.0 - 7.4.3.4

**Fixed Versions:**
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.5

**Additional Notes:**
*   There is no fix available for Liferay Portal 7.3; users are advised to upgrade to 7.4.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Dynamic Data Mapping module.
