The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC10 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `speed_dir` parameter, within the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint, is concatenated into a buffer using `sprintf` without proper size checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** The lack of size validation when using `sprintf` allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided PoC demonstrates a crash of the router.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The writeup mentions the possibility of crafting an exploit to achieve root shell access.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint.
*   **`speed_dir` parameter:** The attacker controls the contents of the `speed_dir` parameter, which is used to overflow the buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, implying they need to be on the same network or have access to the router through port forwarding or similar means.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know that the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint is vulnerable.
*  **Authentication:**  Although not explicitly stated, the "Cookie" header in the provided PoC suggests that at least some authentication might be required (e.g., `ac_login_info=passwork; password=1111`) however this is not clear how this impacts the vulnerability.

The provided information is more detailed than the basic CVE description. It provides specific details on how to trigger the vulnerability, the vulnerable endpoint, and the vulnerable parameter (`speed_dir`).
