{
  "CVE-2022-42915": {
    "Root cause": "Flaws in the error/cleanup handling when an HTTP proxy refuses a CONNECT request for non-HTTP(S) URLs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Double free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A double free could be triggered, potentially leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL (e.g., `dict`, `gopher`, `gophers`, `ldap`, `ldaps`, `rtmp`, `rtmps`, `telnet`), and the HTTP proxy refuses the connection.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control the URL and HTTP proxy settings used by curl."
  }
