## CVE-2022-42916

# HSTS bypass via IDN

Project curl Security Advisory, October 26 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-42916.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl's HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it to keep using
HTTP.

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly
instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is
provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in
the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII
counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character
UTF-8 U+3002 (`IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP`) instead of the common
ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`.

Like this: `http://curlãseã`

## INFO

This flaw was introduced in [commit
7385610d0c7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7385610d0c7), which was shipped enabled by default from [commit
d71ff2b9db566b3f](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/d71ff2b9db566b3f) in curl [7.77.0](vuln-7.77.0.html).

This issue is similar to the previous [CVE-2022-30115](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-30115.html).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-42916 to this issue.

CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.77.0](vuln-7.77.0.html) to and including [7.85.0](vuln-7.85.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.77.0](vuln-7.77.0.html) and curl >= [7.86.0](vuln-7.86.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7385610d0c7>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/53bcf55b4538067e6>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.86.0](vuln-7.86.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Stick to always using `HTTPS://` in URLs

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on October 11, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on October 18, 2022.

libcurl [7.86.0](vuln-7.86.0.html) was released on October 26 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-42915

# HTTP proxy double free

Project curl Security Advisory, October 26 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-42915.html)

## VULNERABILITY

If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a
non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by
issuing a `CONNECT` request to the proxy, and then
*tunnels* the rest of protocol through.

An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only
allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS)
and instead return a non-200 response code to the client.

Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a
double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL
for the transfer: `dict`, `gopher`,
`gophers`, `ldap`, `ldaps`,
`rtmp`, `rtmps`, `telnet`

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-42915 to this issue.

CWE-415: Double Free

Severity: medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.77.0](vuln-7.77.0.html) to and including [7.85.0](vuln-7.85.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.77.0](vuln-7.77.0.html) and >= [7.86.0](vuln-7.86.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/51c0ebcff2140c3>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/55e1875729f9d9fc7315ce>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.86.0](vuln-7.86.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not do use HTTP proxy

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on October 4, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on October 18, 2022.

libcurl [7.86.0](vuln-7.86.0.html) was released on October 26 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
