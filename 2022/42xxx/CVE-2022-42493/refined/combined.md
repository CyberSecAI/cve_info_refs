# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1640

## Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD m2m m2m\_parse\_router\_config cmd OS command injection vulnerabilities

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-42492,CVE-2022-42491,CVE-2022-42493,CVE-2022-42490

##### SUMMARY

Several OS command injection vulnerabilities exist in the m2m binary of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

##### PRODUCT URLS

QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD is an industrial router with several functionalities and services, such as: SSH, UPNP, VPN, SNMP and many others.

The QUARTZ-GOLD offers a feature called `M2M`. When enabled, the device will execute the `m2m` binary and offer different network services. One of the services the `m2m` binary offers handles several commands. To communicate with this service the client must send a specific UDP packet format.

Several commands use the `m2m_parse_router_config` function:

```
uint m2m_parse_router_config(char *data,uint data_len)

{
  [...]

  memset(nvram_command,0,0x800);
  memset(param,0,0x400);
  syslog(5,"----parse_router_config %d:%s----",data_len,data);
  syslog(5,"----NVRAM Set Command Start----");
  len_first_no_& = strspn(data,"&");
  strncpy(param,data + len_first_no_&,0x400);
  first_& = strcspn(param,"&" );
  param[first_&] = '\0';
  local_19 = 0;
  pcVar1 = strchr(data + len_first_no_&,L'&');
  while (param[0] != '\0') {
    memset(nvram_command,0,0x800);
    sprintf(nvram_command,"nvram set %s",param);                                                                [1]
    syslog(5,"%s",nvram_command);
    system(nvram_command);                                                                                      [2]
    [...]

```

This function will parse data in the UDP packet received. The command expects a list that looks like: `<nvram_key_1>=<nvram_value_1>&<nvram_key_2>=<nvram_value_2>....`. Then, for each key value pair, it will compose at `[1]` the `nvram set <nvram_key>=<nvram_value>`. The composed string will be used as argument for the `system` function at `[2]`. The problem is that from receiving the command packet to `[2]` the data is never sanitized. This allows any string to be used as argument of the `system` call. This can lead to an OS command injection.

Following is the list of the vulnerable commands that will call the `m2m_parse_router_config` function.

#### CVE-2022-42490 - DOWNLOAD\_CFG\_FILE command injection

Following is the portion of `m2m` binary that manages the `DOWNLOAD_CFG_FILE` command:

```
syslog(5,"M2M Command(%02x) DOWNLOAD_CFG_FILE!!!",0x16);
[...]
data_len = __bswap_16(UDP_data_buff.data_len;
syslog(5,"DOWNLOAD_CFG_FILE %d:%s",
        data_len),
        &UDP_data_buff.data);
temp = m2m_parse_router_config(&UDP_data_buff.data, data_len);
[...]

```

The command will call the `m2m_parse_router_config` function with the provided `UDP_data_buff.data`, which is an array of characters, and `UDP_data_buff.data_len`, its length. This will lead to a command injection vulnerability.

#### CVE-2022-42491 - M2M\_CONFIG\_SET command injection

Following is the portion of `m2m` binary that manages the `M2M_CONFIG_SET` command:

```
syslog(5,"M2M Command(%02x) M2M_CONFIG_SET!!!",6);
[...]
data_len = __bswap_16(UDP_data_buff.data_len;
syslog(5,"M2M_CONIFG_SET %d:%s",
       data_len,
       &UDP_data_buff.data);
global_UDP_packet = m2m_parse_router_config(&UDP_data_buff.data,data_len);
[...]

```

The command will call the `m2m_parse_router_config` function with the provided `UDP_data_buff.data`, which is an array of characters, and `UDP_data_buff.data_len`, its length. This will lead to a command injection vulnerability.

#### CVE-2022-42492 - DOWNLOAD\_AD command injection

Following is the portion of `m2m` binary that manages the `DOWNLOAD_AD` command:

```
syslog(5,"M2M Command(%02x) DOWNLOAD_AD!!!",0xe);
[...]
data_len = __bswap_16(UDP_data_buff.data_len;
syslog(5,"M2M_CONIFG_SET %d:%s",
       data_len,
       &UDP_data_buff.data);
if (DOWNLOAD_THREAD_STARTED == 0) {
  global_UDP_packet = m2m_parse_router_config(&UDP_data_buff.data,data_len);
[...]

```

The command will call the `m2m_parse_router_config` function with the provided `UDP_data_buff.data`, which is an array of characters, and `UDP_data_buff.data_len`, its length. This will lead to a command injection vulnerability.

#### CVE-2022-42493 - DOWNLOAD\_INFO command injection

Following is the portion of `m2m` binary that manages the `DOWNLOAD_INFO` command:

```
syslog(5,"M2M Command(%02x) DOWNLOAD_INFO!!!",0xc);
[...]
data_len = __bswap_16(UDP_data_buff.data_len;
syslog(5,"M2M_CONIFG_SET %d:%s",
     data_len,
     &UDP_data_buff.data);
nvram_unset("type");
temp = m2m_parse_router_config(&UDP_data_buff.data, data_len);
[...]

```

The command will call the `m2m_parse_router_config` function with the provided `UDP_data_buff.data`, which is an array of characters, and `UDP_data_buff.data_len`, its length. This will lead to a command injection vulnerability.
