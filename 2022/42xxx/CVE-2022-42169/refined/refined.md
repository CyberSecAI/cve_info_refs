Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of size check in the `sprintf` function when copying the `device_mac` and `device_id` parameters to `mib_value`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability: The `sprintf` function copies the data to a buffer on the stack without checking the size of the input parameters (`device_mac` and `device_id`). This allows an attacker to write beyond the buffer, causing a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Router crash: Exploiting the vulnerability results in a crash of the router.
- Potential for root shell: The provided text states that an attacker can potentially write an exploit to obtain a root shell on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/addWifiMacFilter` endpoint.
- Malicious parameters: The attacker controls the `device_mac` and `device_id` parameters in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, typically within the same network.
- Parameter manipulation: The attacker must be able to craft malicious values for the `device_mac` parameter to trigger the stack overflow.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided PoC code demonstrates how to send a large `device_mac` parameter in a POST request to cause the stack overflow.
- The vulnerability exists in Tenda AC10 router firmware version AC10V15.03.06.23.
- The vulnerable parameters are `device_mac` and `device_id`.
