The provided content is related to CVE-2022-42942.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory corruption vulnerability due to a read access violation. Specifically, a maliciously crafted DWF or .PCT file, when consumed through the `DesignReview.exe` application, can trigger this vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds Read: The application attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory boundaries.
- Memory Corruption: The out-of-bounds read leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious actor crafting a specially designed DWF or .PCT file.
- The victim must then consume this malicious file through the `DesignReview.exe` application. This involves user interaction, such as opening the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious DWF or .PCT file.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the victim and induce the victim to open it using the vulnerable application.
