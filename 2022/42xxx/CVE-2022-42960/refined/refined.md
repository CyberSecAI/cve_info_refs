Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization within the "message" event listener of the EqualWeb accessibility widget. Specifically, the widget does not validate the origin of the messages it receives through the `postMessage` API and directly uses a message payload to call a function which leads to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability lies in the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) by executing arbitrary JavaScript code. Specifically, the `getBlock` method of the widget uses jQuery selector to evaluate HTML tags automatically, which leads to XSS.
* **Lack of Origin Validation:** The widget fails to check the origin of the incoming `postMessage` messages, allowing any website to send messages to the widget and trigger the vulnerability.
* **Unsanitized Input:** The widget uses the `n.optName` property, extracted from the postMessage, directly in a jQuery selector (`$IND(e)`) without sanitization, which is vulnerable to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Account Takeover:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to impersonate a user and take over their account.
* **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could perform any action on behalf of the user, such as changing settings or making purchases.
* **Sensitive Data Theft:** Attackers could steal sensitive information, such as cookies and session tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Cross-Origin PostMessage:** The attacker sends a malicious `postMessage` to a vulnerable website hosting the EqualWeb widget from a different domain.
* **Manipulation of DOM:** The attacker crafts the message payload with malicious HTML/JavaScript code to be executed in the context of the vulnerable website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send messages using the `postMessage` API to a website that is using a vulnerable version of the EqualWeb accessibility widget.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable code within the EqualWeb widget, particularly the `getBlock` method and the bypass for the initial checks.
*   No special permissions are required. The attacker can execute the attack from any web page.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in specific older versions of the EqualWeb widget.
*   The exploit is triggered by sending a message with a crafted payload where the `command` property is set to `"INDactivate"`, the `method` is `getBlock`, and the `optName` property contains the malicious JavaScript.
*   The blog post includes a list of vulnerable versions and hostnames associated with the widget.
*   The blog post recommends using "just-in-time" loading of third-party widgets to reduce the attack surface.
