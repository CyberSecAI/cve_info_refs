- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the `delete_room_type` function within the `/hprms/classes/Master.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The application directly uses the user-supplied `id` parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive information such as the database name or potentially other data, and may be able to modify data, or gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/hprms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_room_type` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, and needs to know (or guess) the parameter to inject into.
