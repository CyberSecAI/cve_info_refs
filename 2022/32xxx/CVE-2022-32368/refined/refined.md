- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input being used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `/school/model/get_grade.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database (as shown by the database name leakage) or modify data, depending on the database user's permissions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `/school/model/get_grade.php` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to exploit the vulnerability.
