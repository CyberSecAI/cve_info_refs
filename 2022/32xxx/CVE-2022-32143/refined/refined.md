Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2022-32143:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The CODESYS V2 file download and upload function lacks proper filtering, allowing read and potentially write access to internal files in the working directory. This includes potentially sensitive files like PLC firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties. The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control and lack of filtering when handling file downloads and uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially read and write to internal files on the PLC, including firmware files, resulting in information disclosure, modification of device configuration, or a complete compromise of the device.
*   This could lead to denial-of-service, data manipulation, or potentially taking complete control over the PLC system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the network communication server for the CODESYS protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have successfully authenticated to the CODESYS Control V2 runtime system. This means either a successful login to the controller or if no level 1 online password is configured on the controller.
*   The attacker needs network access to the affected system and knowledge of the CODESYS communication protocol.
