- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform brute force attacks to take over the admin account.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, specifically targeting the admin authentication form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker position required, but network access to the device is needed.
