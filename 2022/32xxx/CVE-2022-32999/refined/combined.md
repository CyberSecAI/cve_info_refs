### **[di1l0o](/di1l0o)** commented [Jun 8, 2022](#issue-1264295362)

| We found a malicious backdoor in version 0.0.1 of this project, and its malicious backdoor is the request package. Even if the request package was removed by pypi, many mirror sites did not completely delete this package, so it could still be installed.When using pip install cloudlabeling==0.0.1 -i <http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple> --trusted-host pypi.doubanio.com, the request malicious plugin can be successfully installed.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58363074/172553554-e5084d83-3242-44a7-98b8-b7638b9b9108.png)  Repair suggestion: delete version 0.0.1 in PyPI |
