The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Advanced School Management System v1.0 by itsourcecode.com.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `get_teacher.php` script when handling the `id` parameter, which is directly incorporated into a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `/school/model/get_teacher.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database Information Disclosure: An attacker can extract sensitive database information by injecting malicious SQL queries. In the example provided, the attacker was able to identify the database name (`std_db`).
- Complete compromise of the system is possible if further chained with other vulnerabilities and/or more advanced SQL injection techniques.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/school/model/get_teacher.php` with a crafted `id` parameter containing SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoint.
- No special privileges are needed and the attack can be performed remotely.
