# XMPP

Based on the Open Standard eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, our instant messaging products provide secure server and client software for a variety of needs.

![MLWC-#1](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MLWC-1-150x150.png)
## M-Link User Server

M-Link User Server is Isodeâs core Instant Messaging and Presence server based on the XMPP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) standard. Its feature set makes it ideal for deployments where security, reliability and special functionality are vital as well as for large public deployments.

[XMPP ServerView this product](https://www.isode.com/product/xmpp-server/)

![irc-configuration](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/irc-configuration-150x150.png)
## M-Link IRC Gateway

The M-Link IRC Gateway enables connections between IRC and XMPP servers. The Gateway operates by associating IRC Channels with XMPP Multi-User Chat (MUC) rooms hosted on the Gateway. The MUC rooms can be assessed by XMPP users on connected XMPP servers and by IRC users on connected IRC servers.

[XMPP/IRC GatewayView this product](https://www.isode.com/product/xmpp-irc-gateway/)

![MLWC-#2](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MLWC-2-150x150.png)
## M-Link for Mobile Units

XMPP works efficiently over medium and high speed networks. Many military deployments will use network links with poor and variable quality, such as SatCom and HF Radio, with high latency being a particular problem. M-Link products for Mobile Units are designed to optimize operations over these networks.

![hq-chatroom-#4](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hq-chatroom-4-150x150.png)
## XMPP Chat Client

Swift is a modern web chat client, designed to be used anywhere, on any device. It enables you to deploy a high capacity, secure chat solution across your network with zero footprint deployment.

![MLWC-#2](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MLWC-2-150x150.png)
## M-Link Edge

M-Link Edge is used to provide an XMPP Boundary Guard service to protect organizational boundaries and provide Cross Domain services.

[XMPP Boundary GuardXMPP Boundary Guard](https://www.isode.com/product/xmpp-boundary-guard/)

## The NATO Standard for instant messaging

Our XMPP products provide secure instant messaging solutions that can fit into any existing network that you have running. Our products are completely hardware independent

![security first](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/security-first-150x150.png)

### Security First

Our XMPP products focus on security first, with a wide range of features from security labelling in chat rooms and individual message to the ability to set standard messaging rules for users, we give you complete control over how your operators use your XMPP network.

![certificate-diploma](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/certificate-diploma-150x150.png)

### Open Standards

Built with interoperability in mind, we use open standards wherever possible so that our products can be implemented alongside any systems you or your external partners already have in place, without having to force complicated work arounds to keep communication flowing.

![instant-messaging](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instant-messaging-150x150.png)

### Easily Deployable

We design our software to be easily deployable, giving you the ability to quickly roll out an entire communications network at rapid pace. A vital option for when you need to quickly adapt to rapidly changing situations.

![network message](https://www.isode.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/network-message-150x150.png)

### Extremely Adaptable

While our XMPP software works best when you use them with our entire XMPP product suite, they can very easily be slotted into any network you have already. No matter the setup you have, or the products you chose they can be used in parts, or as a whole to provide your existing network with extra functionality without any wider requirements.
