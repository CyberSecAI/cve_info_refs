The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Hospital's Patient Records Management System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `view_room_type.php` file where the `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/hprms/admin/room_types/view_room_type.php` file, specifically through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. In the example given, the attacker is able to extract the database name, `hprms_db`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP GET request to `/hprms/admin/room_types/view_room_type.php` by manipulating the `id` parameter with a crafted SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
