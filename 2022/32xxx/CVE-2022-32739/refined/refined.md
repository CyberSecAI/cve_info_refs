- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When the *Secure::DisableBanner* system configuration is disabled, and an agent shares their calendar via a public URL, the exported ICS file includes the OTRS release number.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. The OTRS version number is revealed in the exported ICS file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain knowledge of the OTRS version being used, which could then be used to target specific vulnerabilities associated with that version.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could access the public URL of a shared calendar to obtain the ICS file containing the OTRS version.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the public URL of a shared calendar and the user must have the *Secure::DisableBanner* system configuration disabled.
