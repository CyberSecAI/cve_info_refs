- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to weak password requirements (CWE-521).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak password requirements. The vulnerability allows an attacker to brute-force the password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring no special user interaction (UI:N) or privileges (PR:N) on the vulnerable devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the device to perform brute-force attacks.
