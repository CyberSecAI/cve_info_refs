{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` component where the `FUN_0041af40` function (at address 0x41af40) retrieves the `cloneMac` parameter from a JSON payload and copies it to stack-allocated local variables without verifying its length.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack buffer overflow due to unchecked copy of user-supplied data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution through a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted JSON payload with an oversized `cloneMac` parameter to the `/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router's web interface."
