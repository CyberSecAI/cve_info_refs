Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32087:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a server crash that occurs within the `Item_args::walk_args` function, stemming from how virtual columns are handled in MariaDB. Specifically, the crash is triggered by a combination of specific SQL statements involving virtual columns, the `CASE` statement and functions like `CURRENT_USER()` with `TO_DATE()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion/Invalid Memory Access**: The vulnerability arises when the server attempts to check the type of a scalar value in a virtual column expression which can lead to a pure virtual function call and subsequent crash.
- **Incorrect Handling of Virtual Columns:** The issue highlights flaws in how MariaDB handles expressions within virtual columns, particularly when involving specific combinations of functions and data types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a server crash, leading to a denial of service. This can disrupt database operations and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted SQL queries that include virtual columns, the `CASE` statement, `CURRENT_USER()` and `TO_DATE()` to the MariaDB server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute SQL queries on the target MariaDB server. This may require a valid user account.

**Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs when the `Item::check_type_scalar` method is called during the processing of a virtual column expression with `CASE` statement using the result of the `CURRENT_USER()` function in the `WHEN` clause and later combined with a `TO_DATE()`.
- The provided stack trace shows the crash occurs after `__cxa_pure_virtual` is called, indicating a call to a function with no implementation in the specific context of virtual columns.
- The issue is triggered during `INSERT` statements referencing the virtual column with a specific syntax.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in MariaDB versions 10.3.35, 10.4.25, 10.5.16, 10.6.8, and 10.7.4.
- The vulnerability is present in older, end-of-life (EOL) versions as well.
- NetApp products using vulnerable versions of MariaDB were also affected.
- This vulnerability is a duplicate of MDEV-24176, MDEV-26353, MDEV-26354, MDEV-26407, MDEV-26426 and MDEV-26432.
- This issue is related to MDEV-25772
