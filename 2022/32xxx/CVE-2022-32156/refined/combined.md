# Security updates

Read this topic to learn about the security improvements in the Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud platforms and how you can further secure your deployments with these updates.

See the "Last modified" information at the end of this topic to determine if the topic has been updated since you last reviewed it.

## Introduction

Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform now offer additional options that let you and Splunk operate deployments more securely.

The improvements center around the following themes:

* The addition of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate host name validation and other improvements when Splunk platform instances make secure connections
  + In particular, the Splunk daemon (splunkd), all Python modules that the Splunk platform uses, the Splunk CLI, and App Key Value Store now support TLS certificate validation
* Improvements to universal forwarder security, including the limiting of access to the UF management port to only the local machine
* Upgrades to Splunk deployment client and server authentication logic, including restrictions on how and with what those instance types can communicate

The table in the "Summary of changes" section of this topic provides a summary of the changes, and the following sections provide additional details.

All of these changes come in one of two operational modes. To understand the modes and how they affect your Splunk platform deployment, see [Understand warning mode versus enforcement mode for security updates](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/Updates#Understand_warning_mode_versus_enforcement_mode_for_security_updates) later in this topic.

## Details of security updates

A detailed listing of the changes follows. Follow the links in the "Summary of changes" table for details on how to activate the improvements in your environment.

### Transport Layer Security

Splunk platform components use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to connect securely to one another and internal and external APIs. Each connection uses a TLS certificate to establish the secure connection. The certificates verify that the Splunk platform instances that make the connection are who they say they are. TLS certificates can be configured and validated for nearly all Splunk platform instance types, including indexers, indexer clusters, search heads, search head cluster nodes, deployers, forwarders, deployment servers, license servers, and App Key Value Store.

Most of these improvements center around how the Splunk platform handles TLS certificates. Prior to these updates, Splunk platform instances did not specifically verify the host name information within the TLS certificate that they received when they connected to other instances or APIs. This additional verification step must happen to ensure that the machine to which the instances connected is who it claims to be, and prevents what is known as a "machine-in-the-middle" attack. This is a cyberattack where a malicious actor can position a machine between the two Splunk platform instances on the network and intercept messages between them without either knowing that they aren't actually communicating with each other.

Before the certificate verification can work, Splunk platform instances must be configured to require that the instances that they connect to present a valid certificate prior to the connection completing. This certificate requirement option is different from the host name verification option, and has been available for some time. Many customers already require their Splunk platform instances to present certificates to ensure increased security in their Splunk platform deployments.

Beginning with the 8.2.2202 release of Splunk Cloud Platform and version 9.0 of Splunk Enterprise, you can configure Splunk platform instances to perform host name validation upon connecting to other Splunk platform instances and receiving TLS certificates.

Many of the security changes are disabled initially to prevent problems with downtime in your environment. This is the case with TLS certificate validation. On Splunk Enterprise deployments, and on data collection and forwarding tiers for Splunk Cloud Platform deployments that you manage, as the Splunk administrator, you can enable the feature after you confirm that the TLS certificates in your deployment have the proper configuration. In later versions of both Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform, Splunk will enable the enforcement of certificate validation.

TLS certificate host name validation does not work with the default certificates that come with Splunk Enterprise. You must either generate or obtain certificates from a third party and install them in all of the instances of your Splunk platform deployment. You must then configure the instances to require that they get a valid TLS certificate from other instances upon connection, and that those certificates pass the host name validation check.

Follow the documentation links from this page to the appropriate procedures to perform enablement of TLS certificate validation. You can work with Splunk Support of Professional Services for the best course of action depending on the size of your deployment.

### Deployment client and server authentication logic

The authentication, subscription, and heartbeat logic for deployment clients and servers has changed. No communication between instances happens without TLS certificate validation. The way that deployment clients subscribe to deployment server channels has also changed, and deployment clients ignore certain types of messages that do not specifically come from deployment servers.

Deployment client and server protocol updates begin in warning mode. Splunk does not expect this change to affect your deployment negatively.

### Universal forwarder security

Universal forwarders now have improved security. Beginning with Splunk Enterprise version 9.0, forwarders now require a configuration change to accept inbound connections to their management port from other machines. Additionally, when universal forwarders act as deployment clients, they receive the same deployment-client-to-deployment-server authentication, subscription, and heartbeat logic changes that other deployment clients receive.

Universal forwarder security updates, with the exception of changes to deployment server logic, begin in enforcement mode. Splunk does not expect this change to affect your deployment negatively.

### Risky search command safeguard improvements

Splunk has added some capabilities that you must assign to users who need to run the `dump` search command and any custom search commands. Dashboards that currently use these commands might break if the user that created the dashboards does not hold a role with these capabilities.

### What is a valid TLS certificate?

A valid certificate is one that satisfies all of the following criteria:

* It must not be one of the default certificates that come with the Splunk platform installation packages. Validation doesn't work with the default certificates.
* It must be a regular text file that is in privacy enhanced mail (PEM) format. Validation doesn't work with certificates that are in other formats.
* It must be a full certificate chain. Validation doesn't work with only a leaf certificate.
* It must contain any intermediate certificates, along with the root and server certificate, where applicable.
* It must be valid within its date range. Expired certificates and certificates whose validity has not yet come into force don't work.
* It must use a valid Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) X.509 certificate standard field.
  + Either of those fields must contain a value that matches the host name of the machine that serves the certificate to the connecting client.

If the certificate doesn't meet all of these criteria, then validation, and the connection, fails. Because individual Splunk platform instances must make many network connections to share data, search jobs, artifacts, knowledge bundles, and other Splunk-related information, failed connections can cause problems with Splunk deployments.

## Understand warning mode versus enforcement mode for security updates

The security updates that this topic discusses come in two operation modes. These modes control how the Splunk platform reacts to items in your deployment that do not meet updated Splunk security best practices.

### Warning mode

In Warning mode, Splunk platform instances log problems with configurations that do not align with updated security best practices. Enforcement of the updates does not occur in this mode. Your Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise deployment operates as it currently does, only generating additional logs about the out-of-specification configurations. At any time, you can review the logs to see where your deployment is out of compliance and subsequently reconfigure the instances to bring them into compliance and enable enforcement of the updates.

If you activate and use the Splunk Assist monitoring service, it can identify the instances in your deployment that are out of compliance and provide tools to help you get them into compliance. See [Introduction to Splunk Assist](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DMC/AssistIntro) for additional information about the service and the details it provides.

### Enforcement mode

In Enforcement mode, Splunk platform instances enforce the new security changes. If your configuration does not meet the updated best practices for security, then connections between Splunk platform instances, processes, and APIs can fail, which can cause the deployment to experience breaking problems and downtime.

When Splunk ships versions of the Splunk platform that enable enforcement mode, problems can begin immediately after an upgrade if you have not enabled certificate requirements and TLS host name validation. Ensure that your Splunk platform instances have valid certificates, and that TLS certificate requirements and certificate host name validation are on. You cannot use the default certificates that come with Splunk platform instance installation packages - you must either generate your own certificates or obtain them from a third party.

### When and how each mode affects your Splunk deployment

Some of the security updates start in enforcement mode by default. Splunk does not expect security updates that initially start in enforcement mode to negatively affect Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise deployments. You can monitor your deployment to see whether enforcement mode affects your deployment. The "Summary of changes" table that appears earlier in this topic lists the current operating mode for each security update.

All other changes initially begin in warning mode. Changes that begin in warning mode give you time to configure your Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise deployment to begin enforcing the security updates. To do this, see "Configure your Splunk platform deployment to enforce security updates" later in this topic. Eventually, Splunk will update these changes to operate in enforcement mode by default.

### Steps to address the security update warnings and errors

When you update Splunk Enterprise or Splunk updates Splunk Cloud Platform, security update warnings and errors appear in the splunkd.log file, and for App Key Value Store, the mongodb.log log file. You can review either of the files themselves for the warnings, or you can search the `_internal` index from Splunk Web.

The warnings and errors that you see depend on the operating mode each security update is currently in, the action that the Splunk platform instance is trying to perform, the Splunk service or command that performs the action, and the current state of your configuration. You might see errors that are similar to, but not exactly like, the ones that appear in this table.

## Configure your Splunk platform deployment to enforce security updates

When you upgrade to Splunk Enterprise version 9.0, or Splunk upgrades your Splunk Cloud Platform instance to version 8.2.2202 and higher, the changes that this topic describes are available for you to enable. Splunk has already enabled some of the changes.

To configure the Splunk platform deployment to use enforcement mode for all changes, do the following:

1. Ensure you have valid certificates. If you don't, get or create them. See the following topics for instructions:
   * To create and sign your own certificates, see [How to self-sign certificates](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/Howtoself-signcertificates).
   * To get certificates from a third party, see [How to obtain certificates signed by a third-party for inter-Splunk communication](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/Howtogetthird-partycertificates).
2. Install the certificates on all instances in your Splunk platform deployment, if you have not already.
3. Follow the "Learn More" links in the "Summary of changes" table to procedures that describe how to enable certificate validation for each update.

# Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder CLI connections lacked TLS certificate validation

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2022-0606

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2022-32156](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-32156)

**Published:** 2022-06-14

**Last Update:** 2022-07-18

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 7.4, High

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)

**Bug ID:** SPL-49451

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder versions before 9.0, the Splunk command-line interface (CLI) did not validate TLS certificates while connecting to a remote Splunk platform instance by default. Splunk peer communications configured properly with valid certificates were not vulnerable. However, connections from misconfigured nodes without valid certificates did not fail by default. After updating to version 9.0, see [Configure TLS host name validation for the Splunk CLI](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation#Configure_TLS_host_name_validation_for_the_Splunk_CLI) to enable the remediation.

The vulnerability does not affect the Splunk Cloud Platform. At the time of publishing, we have no evidence of exploitation of this vulnerability by external parties.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder versions to 9.0 or higher and [Configure TLS host name validation for the Splunk CLI](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation#Configure_TLS_host_name_validation_for_the_Splunk_CLI).

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | - | Versions before 9.0 | 9.0.0 |
| Universal Forwarder | 9.0 | - | Versions before 9.0 | 9.0.0 |

## Severity Considerations

Splunk strongly recommends securing your Splunk environment with hardened TLS configurations. See [Securing the Splunk platform with TLS](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/AboutsecuringyourSplunkconfigurationwithSSL) for more information. However, the vulnerability assumes that you have configured your Splunk platform instances to use transport layer security (TLS) certificates for secure network connections. If you have not and are using the default certificates, the vulnerability is not applicable and is informational.

# Configure TLS certificate host name validation for secured connections between Splunk software components

If you have configured your Splunk platform instances to use transport layer security (TLS) certificates for secure network connections with one another, you can also configure the instances to verify host names in the certificates to ensure that the machines that the instances communicate with are who they say they are. This added configuration step improves security across your entire Splunk Cloud Platform forwarding tier and Splunk Enterprise deployment. The procedures in this topic are valid for both Splunk Cloud Platform forwarding tier and Splunk Enterprise instances.

For more information about the security updates, how they operate, and the modes that affect how they work, see [Security updates](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/Updates).

## Introduction

TLS certificate host name validation consists of three separate configurations:

### TLS certificate requirement configuration

The server.conf configuration file controls the TLS certificate requirement. You can only configure TLS certificate requirements by editing the configuration file and specifying the appropriate setting and value. This means you can only perform this configuration on Splunk Enterprise, or on collection and forwarding infrastructure for Splunk Cloud Platform that you manage. You must enable the TLS certificate requirement for the certificate host name validation to work.

The `sslVerifyServerCert` setting controls the TLS certificate requirement feature. When you give this setting a value of "true", the Splunk platform instance requires that any Splunk platform instance to which it connects provides a valid TLS certificate before that connection can complete. If the connected instance does not provide a valid certificate, the requirement check fails and the connection terminates.

If the requirement check succeeds, and you have also configured TLS certificate host name validation, then the validation check happens, as explained in the next section of this topic.

### TLS certificate host name validation configuration

The server.conf configuration file also controls TLS certificate host name validation. Like with the certificate requirement, you can only configure validation by editing the configuration file and specifying the appropriate setting and value. You can only perform this configuration on Splunk Enterprise, or on collection and forwarding infrastructure for Splunk Cloud Platform that you manage.

In nearly all cases, the `sslVerifyServerName` setting controls the TLS certificate host name validation feature. When you give this setting a value of "true", the connecting Splunk platform instance verifies that the TLS certificate that it received is valid and has either a Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) X.509 cryptography standard certificate field that matches the host name of the instance that sent the certificate. This verification must happen before the connection can complete. If the connected server provides a certificate that does not meet these criteria, the validation check fails and the connection terminates.

Before validation can start, the connected instance must first pass the TLS certificate requirement check.

### TLS certificate host name validation configuration for the Splunk CLI

The Splunk CLI has a slightly different setting name for TLS certificate host name validation. When you run the CLI to connect to either a local or remote Splunk platform instance, the CLI uses the `cliVerifyServerName` setting to determine whether or not it is to verify host names on the TLS certificates it receives.

A value of "true" for this setting, like the `sslVerifyServerName` setting, means that the CLI performs TLS hostname validation. The validation works the same as validation does for other Splunk platform instances.

After you turn on TLS hostname validation for the CLI, you can temporarily disable it by using the `--no-host-name-check` CLI argument.

## Prerequisites to enabling TLS certificate host name validation

You must have the following items before you can enable TLS certificate host name validation:

* All Splunk platform instances where you want to enable TLS certificate host name validation must run version 9.0.0 or higher.
* You must have already secured your Splunk platform instances with valid, current certificates that you either created or obtained from a third party. The certificates cannot be the ones that Splunk ships with Splunk platform installation packages. See "What is a valid certificate?" later in this topic for specifics on what a valid certificate is.
* You must have already installed the certificates on all Splunk platform instances in your deployment. The configuration for each instance must already reference the correct certificates.
* You must have already enabled TLS certificate requirements for each instance in your deployment. TLS certificate host name validation doesn't work if your instances do not require TLS certificates in the first place.

### What is a valid certificate?

A valid certificate is one that satisfies all of the following criteria:

* It must not be one of the default certificates that come with the Splunk platform installation packages.
* It must be in privacy enhanced mail (PEM) format. Validation doesn't work with certificates that are in other formats.
* It must be a full certificate chain. Validation doesn't work with only a leaf certificate.
* It must contain any intermediate certificates, along with the root and server certificate, where applicable.
* It must be valid within its date range. Expired certificates and certificates whose validity has not yet come into force do not work.
* It must contain a valid Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) X.509 certificate standard field.
  + Either of those fields must contain a value that matches the host name of the machine that serves the certificate to the connecting client.

## Configure TLS certificate host name validation

Before you attempt to configure TLS certificate host name validation, confirm you have met all the requirements. Then, choose the procedure from the following list for the service or instance type you want to secure with certificate host name validation.

You can only configure certificate host name validation using configuration files. It is not possible to configure this using Splunk Web.

### Configure TLS host name validation for Splunk-to-Splunk communication

Follow this procedure to secure Splunk-to-Splunk communication between instances like indexers, search heads, clusters, and deployment and license servers.

1. Confirm that you have installed the certificates on all your Splunk platform instances.
2. On one of the instances, edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf configuration file.
3. In the server.conf file, add the following settings and values to enable TLS certificate validation:

   ```
   [sslConfig]
   # turns on TLS certificate requirements
   sslVerifyServerCert = true
   # turns on TLS certificate host name validation
   sslVerifyServerName = true
   serverCert = <path to your server certificate>

   ```
4. Copy the configuration to the remainder of your Splunk platform instances.

   You might want to use a deployment server to deliver configurations to other Splunk platform instances.
5. Restart the Splunk platform instances.
6. Test the instance to confirm that it uses the certificate and that TLS host name validation works as you expect.

### Configure TLS host name validation for Splunk Python modules

Follow this procedure if you want to enable TLS certificate host name validation for Python version 3 modules. TLS host name validation does not work with Python version 2 and lower modules.

1. Confirm that you have installed the certificates on all your Splunk platform instances.
2. On one of the instances, edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf configuration file.
3. In the server.conf file, add the following settings and values to enable TLS certificate validation:

   ```
   [pythonSslClientConfig]
   sslVerifyServerCert = true
   sslVerifyServerName = true

   ```
4. Edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/system/local/web.conf configuration file.
5. In the web.conf file, add the following settings and values to specify the server certificate location:

   ```
   [settings]
   serverCert = <path to your server certificate>

   ```
6. Edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/splunk-launch.conf configuration file.
7. In the splunk-launch.conf file, add the following settings and values to enable Python module verification:

   ```
   PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY = 1

   ```
8. Distribute the configuration files to the remainder of your Splunk platform instances.
9. Restart the Splunk platform instances.
10. Test the instance to confirm that it uses the certificate and that TLS host name validation works as you expect. You can review the splunkd.log and python.log log files and, if necessary, change the default logging level temporarily.

### Configure TLS host name validation for the App Key Value Store service

Follow this procedure if you want to enable TLS certificate host name validation for App Key Value Store. TLS host name validation only works for search head clusters that use App Key Value Store.

1. Confirm that you have installed the certificates on all your Splunk platform instances.

   For App Key Value Store, certificates must contain an Organization (O), Organizational Unit (OU), or Domain Component (DC).
2. On one of the instances, edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf configuration file.
3. In the server.conf file, add the following settings and values to enable TLS certificate validation:

   ```
   [kvstore]
   sslVerifyServerCert = true
   sslVerifyServerName = true
   serverCert = <path to your server certificate>

   ```
4. Distribute the configuration file to the remainder of your Splunk platform instances.
5. Restart the Splunk platform instances.
6. Test the instance to confirm that it uses the certificate and that TLS host name validation works as you expect. You can review the splunkd.log and mongod.log log files and, if necessary, change the default logging level temporarily.

### Configure TLS host name validation for the Splunk CLI

Follow this procedure if you want to enable TLS certificate host name validation for the Splunk CLI. You must perform the procedure on any instance where you use the CLI to connect to a Splunk platform instance.

1. Confirm that you have installed the certificates on all your Splunk platform instances.
2. On an instance where you plan to use the CLI, edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf configuration file.
3. In the server.conf file, add the following settings and values to enable TLS certificate validation:

   ```
   [sslConfig]
   # turns on TLS certificate host name validation
   cliVerifyServerName = true
   # Reference the file that contains all root certificate authority certificates combined together
   sslRootCAPath = <path to you server certificate>

   ```
4. Save the configuration file.
5. Distribute the configuration file to all Splunk platform instances where you want to run the CLI.

You do not need to restart the Splunk platform instances. The Splunk CLI picks up the changed configuration when you run it.

7. Test the instance to confirm that it uses the certificate and that TLS host name validation works as you expect. You can review the output of the CLI command.

   To temporarily disable TLS certificate host name validation from the CLI, supply `--no-server-name-check` as an argument to the CLI command.

### Configure universal forwarder management security

Follow this procedure to improve security on universal forwarders by changing the accessibility of the management port.

1. Where applicable, confirm that you have installed TLS certificates on all your universal forwarders.
2. On one of the forwarders, edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf configuration file.
3. In the server.conf file, add the following settings and values:

   ```
   [httpServer]
   disableDefaultPort = true

   ```
4. Edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/system/local/web.conf configuration file.
5. In the web.conf file, add the following settings and values to force the universal forwarder to accept requests on the management port locally:

   ```
   [settings]
   mgmtHostPort = localhost:8089
   # if 'mgmtport' is not already set to "localhost" or is blank

   ```
6. Edit the $SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/splunk-launch.conf configuration file.
7. In the splunk-launch.conf file, add the following settings and values to force the universal forwarder to accept inbound network requests from 127.0.0.1::

   ```
   SPLUNK_BINDIP = 127.0.0.1
   # if 'SPLUNK_BINDIP' is not already set to "localhost"

   ```
8. Save the configuration files.
9. Distribute the configuration files to the remainder of your Splunk platform instances.
10. Restart the Splunk platform instances.
11. Test the forwarder to confirm that it does not allow connections to the management port from other machines.
