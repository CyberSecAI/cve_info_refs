{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Splunk command-line interface (CLI) in versions prior to 9.0 did not validate TLS certificates by default when connecting to a remote Splunk platform instance.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of TLS certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack could be performed by an attacker intercepting communications between a Splunk instance and a CLI client. If an attacker can position a machine between two Splunk platform instances, they can intercept messages between them without either knowing that they aren't actually communicating with each other.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack",
       "Man-in-the-middle (MITM)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the Splunk instance and the CLI client to intercept the communication.",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability does not affect the Splunk Cloud Platform. The issue was remediated by introducing TLS certificate validation for the Splunk CLI in version 9.0. A configuration change is required to enable the remediation. The documentation provides configuration steps to enable the feature."
