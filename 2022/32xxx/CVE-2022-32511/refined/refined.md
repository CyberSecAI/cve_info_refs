    "summary": "The jmespath.rb gem used `JSON.load` instead of `JSON.parse`, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if untrusted input is provided to the load function. This is because `JSON.load` can create objects of arbitrary classes by using the `json_creatable?` and `json_create` methods, whereas `JSON.parse` only creates objects of basic Ruby types (Hash, String, Array, Number).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `JSON.load` instead of `JSON.parse` in the jmespath.rb gem when parsing JSON data. `JSON.load` is unsafe for processing untrusted input because it can instantiate arbitrary Ruby objects by using the `json_creatable?` and `json_create` methods.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of unsafe `JSON.load` method for parsing potentially untrusted JSON input.",
        "Deserialization of untrusted data leading to potential arbitrary code execution."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution if they can control the JSON input that is processed by the vulnerable `JSON.load` calls.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attackers providing malicious JSON payloads to a vulnerable system.",
         "An attacker can inject malicious JSON input via network requests to applications using jmespath.rb."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide or control the JSON string that is processed by the vulnerable jmespath.rb code.",
           "additional_details": "The issue was fixed by replacing calls to `JSON.load` with `JSON.parse`, which does not allow arbitrary object creation by default.  The fix was implemented in version 1.6.1."
