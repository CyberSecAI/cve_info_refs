{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The application allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation, specifically in the `admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings` endpoint.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Lack of file type validation",
      "Direct file storage within the webroot",
      "Execution of uploaded code"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to gain full control over the web server and potentially the underlying system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to the `admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings` endpoint with a malicious PHP file disguised as an image via the `img` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which is likely accessible to any authenticated user, or potentially even unauthenticated users depending on the application's access controls. Access to the admin interface."
