Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32405:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly references "CVE-2022-32405" and describes a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Prison Management System, which aligns with the CVE ID format.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `view_prison.php` script. Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly concatenates the user-provided `id` parameter into the SQL query.
   - **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user input before using it in the SQL query.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as prison details, inmate information, or user credentials.
   - **Data Modification/Deletion:** With sufficient privileges within the database, the attacker could potentially modify or delete data.
   - **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could lead to further attacks like privilege escalation or complete compromise of the application and the underlying system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `id` in the `view_prison.php` script. An attacker crafts a malicious payload within this parameter that manipulates the SQL query.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to access the `view_prison.php` page, which appears to be part of the admin interface based on the path (`/pms/admin/prisons/view_prison.php`). Therefore, they would either need to be an authenticated admin user or be able to bypass the authentication mechanism to access this page.
   - The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL and web application vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerable code snippet is located in `/pms/admin/prisons/view_prison.php:4`:
     ```php
     $qry = $conn->query("SELECT * from `prison_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}' and delete_flag = 0 ");
     ```
   - **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates error-based SQL injection using the `if(database()='pms_db',0,1)` clause to confirm database information.
     -  `http://localhost/pms/admin/prisons/view_prison.php?id=1'-if(database()='pms_db',0,1)%23` is used to check if the database name is `pms_db`.
     -  `http://localhost/pms/admin/prisons/view_prison.php?id=1'-if(database()='wrong',0,1)%23` is used to check if the database name is 'wrong'.
     - The images provided in the github document show the response of a true and false condition from the SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content also includes user comments indicating issues with other parts of the system, such as adding visitors and logging in, however these are not related to the SQL injection vulnerability described in CVE-2022-32405.
*   The content also notes default login credentials which are not related to the CVE.
*   The provided content also indicates the usage of vulnerable technologies such as XAMPP, PHP, and MySQL Database.
