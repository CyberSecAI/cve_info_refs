The content relates to CVE-2022-32117.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow in `jerryx_print_unhandled_exception` function.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `jerryx_print_unhandled_exception` function does not correctly detect the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow when printing exception messages. The printing buffer size was also too small, contributing to the overflow.
**Impact of exploitation:** A stack buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unexpected behavior.
**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing crafted input that results in long exception messages which overflow the buffer during printing. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the function `jerryx_print_unhandled_exception` in `jerry-ext/util/print.c`, called during exception handling within the JerryScript engine.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the JerryScript engine, and trigger an exception that produces a long error message.
