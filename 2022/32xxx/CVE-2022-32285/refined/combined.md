PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Mendix SAML Module allows you to use SAML to authenticate your users in your cloud application.
This module can communicate with any identity provider that supports SAML2.0 or Shibboleth.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-32285

The affected module is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to insufﬁcient input
sanitation. This may allow an attacker to disclose conﬁdential data under certain circumstances.
