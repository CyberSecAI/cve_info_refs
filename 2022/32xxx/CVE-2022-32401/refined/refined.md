Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32401:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root cause:** The application uses an unsanitized user-supplied input `$_GET['id']` directly within an SQL query.

**Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
```php
$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM `inmate_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}'");
```
**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code directly incorporates the value of the `id` parameter from the GET request into the SQL query without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database including user credentials, personal data, or any other information stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker may be able to modify or delete data.
*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, an attacker can potentially gain control of the database server depending on the privileges of the database user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to construct SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerability.

**Specific Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `/pms/admin/inmates/manage_privilege.php` at line 4.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `id` passed through the `$_GET` method.
*   An example error-based SQL injection payload is provided:
    `http://localhost/pms/admin/inmates/manage_privilege.php?id=1'-if(database()='pms_db',0,1)%23`
*   The exploit allows attackers to verify the database name using boolean based exploitation.

The content gives a clear example of how to test the SQL injection and confirms the vulnerability, and provides more detail than a typical CVE description.
