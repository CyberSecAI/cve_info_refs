{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying the name of a template during the delete confirmation process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an authenticated user's session, potentially leading to credential theft or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Zinc application with the ability to create templates and inject the XSS payload. The attacker also needs knowledge of XSS techniques to craft the malicious payload."
  },
    "additional_information": {
    "description": "The vulnerability exists within the delete template functionality. An authenticated user, when creating a template, can insert a malicious JavaScript payload into the 'name' field. When another user (such as an administrator) attempts to delete this template, the stored payload will be executed within their session. The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can then extract credentials of the user who performed the delete operation and transmit these to the attacker's server.",
    "affected_versions": "Versions v0.1.9 through v0.3.1 are vulnerable.",
    "patched_versions": "Version 0.3.2 addresses the vulnerability.",
