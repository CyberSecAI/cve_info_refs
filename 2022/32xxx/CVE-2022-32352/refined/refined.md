The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user input in the `id` parameter when processing the `delete_patient_admission` function within the `Master.php` class, which is part of the Hospital's Patient Records Management System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses user-supplied data within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database Information Disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as database name, table names, column data, and potentially user credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/hprms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_patient_admission`
- Malicious SQL code injected within the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to send HTTP requests.
- Basic knowledge of SQL syntax.
