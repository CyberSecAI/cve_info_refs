Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `manage_doctor.php` file within the Hospital's Patient Records Management System. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of the `id` parameter in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, including patient records, doctor information, and administrative credentials.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify or delete data.
*   **Loss of Integrity:**  The integrity of the application can be compromised by injecting malicious SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET method via the `id` parameter in the URL.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP requests.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/hprms/admin/doctors/manage_doctor.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
*   **Payload Example:** `/hprms/admin/doctors/manage_doctor.php?id=-1' union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8--+`
*   The provided payload attempts to extract the database name.
* The system is using a MySQL Database.
* The default login credentials for the admin account are provided in the report `admin/admin123` which could provide a route to further attack after initial access.
