Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient input validation of user-provided input within "The Scheduler" add-on for Jira. Specifically, the project name is not properly sanitized when creating scheduled issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores unsanitized user input (project name) which is then displayed back to users in the context of a web page. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code into server responses.
*   This JavaScript code is then executed in the browsers of other users who interact with the affected application.
*   By executing JavaScript, attackers can perform actions in the context of other logged-in users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the creation of scheduled issues when project names containing malicious payloads are loaded.
*   The malicious code is injected via the project name field.
*   When the project name is rendered in the context of a web page, the XSS payload is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create projects within Jira with malicious names.
*   No special privileges appear to be required to exploit this.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable request involves a `GET` request to `/rest/thescheduler/1.0/project`
*   The server response includes the project name which is not sanitized.
*   The example provided shows how a project name like "Pent![](x)Proj" causes the XSS.

**Solution:**

*   The recommended solution is context-sensitive HTML encoding of user input.
*   This prevents the browser from interpreting the malicious code as executable JavaScript.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects The Scheduler version 6.5.0.
*   A patch was released by the manufacturer on 2022-07-12.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Lukas Fai√ü of SySS GmbH.
