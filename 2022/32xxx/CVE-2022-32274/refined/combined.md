-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
Advisory ID: SYSS-2022-040
Product: The Scheduler
Manufacturer: Transition Technologies PSC
Affected Version(s): 6.5.0
Tested Version(s): 6.5.0
Vulnerability Type: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Closed
Manufacturer Notification: 2022-05-27
Solution Date: 2022-07-12
Public Disclosure: 2022-07-13
CVE Reference: CVE-2022-32274
Author of Advisory: Lukas Faiß, SySS GmbH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
The Scheduler is an add-on for Jira for scheduling issues in Jira.
The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):
"The Scheduler allows you to plan and automate your process – all you
need to do is to create issue template, define when it should be
created – and that’s all!"
Due to insufficient input validation of user-provided input,
The Scheduler is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
The creation function of the scheduled issues add-on is prone to an
XSS attack. XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to embed malicious
JavaScript code into server replies which is later executed in the browsers
of other users. By executing JavaScript, attackers can, for example, perform
actions in the context of other logged-in users.
For testing purposes, the add-on of the manufacturer[1] was used in
a local Jira Server[4] installation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
The creation function of the scheduled issues add-on is vulnerable to an
XSS attack.
If a project with the name "Pent![](x)" is created, it will be loaded via the following request when a
scheduled issue is created:
GET /rest/thescheduler/1.0/project?userKey=JIRAUSER31112&\_=1652690457502 HTTP/2
Host: [REDACTED]
Cookie:

Accept: \*/\*
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0
User-Agent:
Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: "Linux"
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Referer: https://[REDACTED]/secure/pl.com.tt.thescheduler.CreateScheduledIssue\_Step1!default.jspa?formId=5aa106a2-d33f-4157-b068-aeb067808c74
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
The response contains the project name. Within this page, the malicious
code will be executed.
Here is a line of the response that contains the malicious input:
...

"id":14661,
"key":"PSOPPPP",
"name":"Pent![](x)Proj",
"avatar":"https://[REDACTED]/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=12473"

### More details

Doing the same things is very mechanic. Creating the same Jira issues also. If you feel that you are wasting time doing it manually - The Scheduler plugin is perfect solution for you!

The Scheduler allows you to plan and automate your process – all you need to do is to create issue template, define when it should be created – and that’s all!

Your issues can be created daily, weekly, monthly, or you can create your own interval. You can create pending issues and even manually execute them with a single click!

Since version 5.0 you can [attach sub-tasks](https://psc-software.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SCHED/pages/2587337/Add%2BSub-Task%2Bto%2BScheduled%2BIssue%2B5.x) to your scheduled issues and take your automation to the next level.

With our [Permissions](https://psc-software.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SCHED/pages/1322024987/Permissions) you can define who can create scheduled issues: single users, groups or project role.

Clone scheduled issues and populate them to other projects. If you want to share your recurring tasks or do a backup, use our import/export feature to easily bring back all the settings or import data to another instance.

Use [The Scheduler](https://psc-software.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SCHED/pages/2452271/The%2BScheduler%2B5.x%2Bdocumentation) and start saving your time!
