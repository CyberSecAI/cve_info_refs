Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of the `downloadURL` parameter before using it in a system command. Specifically, the `url_get_contents` function attempts to fetch content from a provided URL. If `file_get_contents` fails, it falls back to using `wget`, passing the unsanitized URL directly to the command line.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs a `wget` command using user-supplied input without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server process. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/objects/aVideoEncoder.json.php` endpoint.
- **`downloadURL` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected into the `downloadURL` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a registered user with the permission to upload videos.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `objects/aVideoEncoder.json.php` file.
- The vulnerable function is `downloadVideoFromDownloadURL`, which in turn calls `url_get_contents` and then falls back to `wget`.
- The `wget` function constructs the command using the user-provided `downloadURL` without sanitizing the input, leading to command injection.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `file_get_contents` fails and `wget` is used.
- The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the injection of `sleep 2` to cause a delay, showcasing the arbitrary command execution capability.
- The vulnerability affects versions WWBN AVideo 11.6 and dev master commit 3f7c0364.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands by controlling the `downloadURL` parameter in the HTTP POST request.
