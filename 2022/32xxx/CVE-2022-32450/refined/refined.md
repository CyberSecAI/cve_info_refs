Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is that AnyDesk creates directories and files under the user's AppData folder with "Modify" permissions for the user and the AnyDesk process writes to these locations with SYSTEM privileges. This allows a local, unprivileged user to manipulate these locations by creating symbolic links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Write via Symbolic Link:** The vulnerability allows an unprivileged local user to create symbolic links in the user's AppData folder controlled by AnyDesk to arbitrary, privileged locations on the filesystem. Because AnyDesk writes to those locations with SYSTEM privileges, the application will follow the symbolic link and write data to the user-specified location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** By overwriting configuration or system files, the attacker can cause a denial of service. This could include disrupting anti-virus software or other critical system components.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with user-controlled content by manipulating chat logs (function B).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system and be a non-administrative user.
*   **Symbolic Link Creation:**  The attacker needs to create a symbolic link using a tool or script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a regular user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to Create Symbolic Links:**  The attacker must have the ability to create symbolic links (e.g., using a tool like `mklink` or the linked `CreateSymlink` tool).
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable paths and write operations:** The attacker must be aware of the affected AnyDesk directories and the file writing behaviors in functions A and B.
*   **AnyDesk 7.0.9:** The vulnerable version of AnyDesk is 7.0.9

**Affected Functions:**
*   **Function A**:  `ad.trace` file creation on a remote connection.
*  **Function B**: Chat log file creation and storage.

**Exploit Steps**
* **Function A**
    1. Remove the AnyDesk directory in AppData
    2. Create symbolic link pointing `ad.trace` to a privileged file location.
    3. Connect from a remote machine
    4.  The content of `ad.trace` will be written to the target file.
*   **Function B**
    1. Change the remote connector name.
    2. Initiate a remote connection and send a message through the chat function
    3. Note the chat log file name created.
    4. Remove the AnyDesk `chat` directory.
    5. Create a symbolic link with the chat log name pointing to a privileged location.
    6. Type a message into the chat room, which will write the message to the privileged location.

**Additional notes:**
The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by showing step-by-step exploitation. The attacker can control the content written when exploiting Function B (chat log) and overwrite arbitrary file content.
