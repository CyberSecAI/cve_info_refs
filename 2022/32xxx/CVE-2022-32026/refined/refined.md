Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `manage_booking.php` file of the Car Rental Management System v1.0. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly uses user-provided input from the `id` parameter within an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. This includes the database name (as shown in the example payload) and potentially other sensitive data such as user credentials, booking details, etc.
*   **Potential for Data Manipulation:**  Beyond data disclosure, an attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database, depending on the database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the `manage_booking.php` file.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server where the Car Rental Management System is hosted.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP GET requests.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL to craft malicious payloads for extracting or manipulating data.
*   **No Authentication needed for exploitation:** This specific exploit can be done without logging into the admin account.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/car-rental-management-system/admin/manage_booking.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
*   **Example Payload:** `/car-rental-management-system/admin/manage_booking.php?id=-1%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,database(),8,9,10,11--+`
*   **Database:** The example shows that the database is named `car_rental_db`.
