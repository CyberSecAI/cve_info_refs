```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `parse_macfilter_rule` function copies data from the POST parameter `deviceList` to a stack buffer without performing any size checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Lack of input validation on the size of the `deviceList` POST parameter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause a stack overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/goform/setBlackRule` endpoint with an overly large `deviceList` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected device's web interface."
