IGSS (Interactive Graphical SCADA System)

14 June 2022 (14 March 2023)

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of multiple vulnerabilities in its Data Server module for the IGSS
(Interactive Graphical SCADA System) product.

IGSS product is a SCADA system used for monitoring and controlling industrial processes. The
Data Server is a module with a TCP interface used by other modules to access data of the
SCADA System.

Failure to apply the remediation provided below may result in denial of service and data files in
the IGSS Report folder being lost, added, changed, or exposed. Further, it may risk remote
code execution, which could result in various issues, including disclosure of data and loss of
control of the SCADA System with IGSS running in production mode.

March 14, 2023 Update: The CVE-2022-32528 description details have been clarified (page 2).

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to
their systems. We strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these
patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact
Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Follow the general security recommendation below and verify that devices are isolated
on a private network and that firewalls are configured with strict boundaries for devices
that require remote access.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
