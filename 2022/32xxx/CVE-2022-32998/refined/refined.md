The provided content relates to CVE-2022-32998.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a malicious backdoor introduced into versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 of the `cryptoasset-data-downloader` package. This backdoor was implemented through a compromised `request` package, which was available on some mirror sites even after being removed from the official PyPI repository.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inclusion of a malicious dependency (`request` package) in the `cryptoasset-data-downloader` package.
- The malicious `request` package contains a backdoor which allows for remote code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on systems that install the compromised package, effectively acting as a remote backdoor.

**Attack vectors:**
- Installation of the compromised `cryptoasset-data-downloader` package version 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 from a malicious mirror site using pip. The example provided is `http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needed to compromise the `request` package and ensure it is available on certain mirror sites.
- The victim needs to install the compromised version of `cryptoasset-data-downloader` from the malicious mirror using a command like `pip install cryptoasset-data-downloader==1.0.1 -i <http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple> --trusted-host pypi.doubanio.com`
