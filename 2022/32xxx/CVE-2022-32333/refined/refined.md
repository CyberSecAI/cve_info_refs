- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `receipt.php` file. The `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization and validation, making the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to perform database queries, potentially extracting sensitive information, modifying data, or even taking complete control of the database server. The provided example shows the attacker extracting the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `/ffos/admin/sales/receipt.php` with a crafted `id` parameter that contains SQL injection payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and knowledge of SQL syntax. There are no additional special privileges needed for the attack.
