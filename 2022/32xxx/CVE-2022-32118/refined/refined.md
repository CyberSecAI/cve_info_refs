The provided content is related to CVE-2022-32118.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Arox School ERP Pro application has insufficient input sanitization, which allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious scripts can be injected into the application's database through various input fields and then executed when other users access the affected pages.
- Reflected XSS: Malicious scripts can be injected through URL parameters, which are then reflected back to the user's browser, causing the execution of the script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Stealing cookies
- Defacement of the web page
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- URL parameters: Attackers can inject malicious scripts through the URL parameters
- Form fields: Attackers can inject malicious scripts into form fields that are stored in the database

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For stored XSS: An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application that contain malicious scripts in the vulnerable parameters/fields.
- For reflected XSS: An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a link that contains the malicious script, or through another method that results in a browser making a request that returns the malicious script.
- The attacker needs to be able to identify vulnerable parameters and forms
