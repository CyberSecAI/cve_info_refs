{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The login functionality of Mealie allows an unauthenticated user to enumerate existing accounts by timing the server's response time.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Time-based user enumeration vulnerability exists in the /api/auth/token endpoint. The server responds faster when a non-existent user is provided compared to an existing user during the authentication process."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate valid usernames by observing the response times from the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "An unauthenticated attacker can send login requests to the /api/auth/token endpoint with different usernames.",
      "The attacker measures the time taken for the server to respond. A significantly lower response time indicates that the provided username does not exist in the system."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the /api/auth/token endpoint and measure response times, requiring no specific privileges or access."
