| First Check  * This is not a feature request * I added a very descriptive title to this issue. * I used the GitHub search to find a similar issue and didn't find it. * I searched the Mealie documentation, with the integrated search. * I already read the docs and didn't find an answer.  What is the issue you are experiencing?Time-based user enumeration The login functionality of Mealie allows an unauthenticated user to enumerate existing accounts by timing the server's response time.  The average time it takes the API server to respond is significantly lower for non-existing users than existing users.  [Pasted image 20220602164724](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16727235/171661525-85625b49-da7b-4720-bc9f-6fb655721c4b.png) Impact The impact on Mealie is low (3,7); there will only be a handful of users on any deployment of Mealie. I am assuming that the probability of finding valid usernames on a randomly exposed instance is low.  The attack complexity is high, and the impact on confidentiality is low.  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N - Low 3,7 <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N>  The vulnerability is related to CWE-203. FixesPerform cryptographic operation Is also possible to separate the logic of checking passwords and usernames inside the core/security/security.py into two different checks.  Then adding the verify\_password function with some random invalid data to make sure that both checks will take a similar amount of time to complete  ```     if not user:         verify_password("abc123cba321", "$2b$12$JdHtJOlkPFwyxdjdygEzPOtYmdQF5/R5tHxw5Tq8pxjubyLqdIX5i")         return False          if not verify_password(password, user.password):         return False ``` Set minimum response time A possible fix would be setting a minimal randomized time that is required before the auth function returns a response code. The time should be between the fastest and slowest time it takes to calculate and compare the password hash.

| This is my attempt of implementing a fix by adding a randomized time delay. I'm not experienced with software development so it will probably have to be reworked.  <https://github.com/underfl0w/mealie/blob/Token_delay/mealie/routes/auth/auth.py> |
