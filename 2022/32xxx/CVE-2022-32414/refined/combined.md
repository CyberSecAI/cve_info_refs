## Commit

[Permalink](/nginx/njs/commit/31ed93a5623f24ca94e6d47e895ba735d9d97d46)

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fixed aggregation methods of Promise ctor with array-like object.

```
Previously, while iterating over an array-like object the methods may be
resolved with INVALID values. INVALID value is a special internal type which
should never be visible by ordinary functions.

The fix is to ensure that absent elements are represented by undefined value.

The following methods were fixed Promise.all(), Promise.allSettled(),
    Promise.any(), Promise.race().

This closes [#483](https://github.com/nginx/njs/issues/483) issue on Github.
