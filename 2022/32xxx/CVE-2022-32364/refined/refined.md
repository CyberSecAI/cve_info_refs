{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter within the `/psrs/admin/?page=products/manage_product` URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. The provided example shows an attacker determining the length of the database name using a boolean-based blind SQL injection.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to `/psrs/admin/?page=products/manage_product` with a malicious SQL query injected into the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and needs to be aware of the vulnerable URL parameter."
