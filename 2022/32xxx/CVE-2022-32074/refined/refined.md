    {
      "source": "github.com_bdbf086e_20250114_212103.html",
      "root_cause": "The code does not properly sanitize or validate user input before including it in the output, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Lack of output encoding"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application, which can then be executed by other users' browsers. This can lead to:",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious script injected via HTTP request parameters such as 'order', 'type', and 'state'",
		"Malicious script injected via database and later included in dynamic content"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to find or create an input vector which reflects the data back to the user. This could be through manipulating URL parameters or other user-supplied data that is not validated before being used in the output."
    }
  ],
   "additional_notes": [
	    "The provided diff shows that the fix involves encoding the output using `Format::htmlchars()`.",
        "The vulnerability is present in the `audit/class.audit.php` and `audit/templates/auditlogs.tmpl.php` files in the osTicket-plugins repository.",
        "The OWASP content provides detailed information on XSS vulnerabilities and their prevention. It does not specifically describe CVE-2022-32074."
