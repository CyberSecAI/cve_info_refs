{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter within the `delete_doctor` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the `delete_doctor` function of the `Master.php` file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this case, the attacker was able to extract the database name. The impact can further expand to complete database compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through an HTTP POST request to `/hprms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_doctor` with the vulnerable parameter `id`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They don't need to be authenticated to exploit the SQLi vulnerability because the backend is accessed without authentication."
