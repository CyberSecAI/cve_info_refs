    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient HTML sanitization in Orchard Core, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') [CWE-79]"
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated user with editor security role can inject a persistent HTML modal dialog component into the dashboard that will affect admin users. This injected modal dialog prevents access to any other element on the page. After submitting input to the modal, the admin will be redirected to a malicious host and the attacker can receive the confidential data (userâ€™s credentials).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker, with the 'Editor' role and the 'Manage the Admin Dashboard' privilege, can inject malicious HTML into a dashboard widget."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the 'Editor' role and the 'Manage the Admin Dashboard' privilege. This allows them to edit HTML content within dashboard widgets.",
      "additional_information": "The provided information includes a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) with step-by-step instructions and the malicious HTML code used to trigger the vulnerability. It also specifies that the 'form' tag was removed from the allowed tags during sanitization to mitigate this type of attack."
