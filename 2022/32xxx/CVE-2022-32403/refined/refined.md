Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32403:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the direct inclusion of the `$_GET['id']` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```php
$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM `record_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}'");
```

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the `id` parameter from the GET request is directly inserted into the SQL query. An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code, which will be executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
    - Access sensitive data from the database, including inmate records, personal information, and system credentials.
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
    - Potentially gain control of the database server.
- **System Compromise:** In some scenarios, depending on the database permissions and the server configuration, a skilled attacker might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Loss of Data Integrity:** By modifying data, an attacker could compromise the accuracy and integrity of the prison management system.
- **Denial of Service:** Heavy injection queries or data corruption could lead to performance degradation or system crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of the `manage_record.php` script.
   -  Example: `http://localhost/pms/admin/inmates/manage_record.php?id=1'--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic understanding of SQL:** Some knowledge of SQL syntax is necessary to craft effective injection payloads.

**Specific Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Payloads:**
- **Error Based SQL Injection:** The provided PoC demonstrates an error-based SQL injection using a conditional statement within the `id` parameter:

   -   `http://localhost/pms/admin/inmates/manage_record.php?id=1'-if(database()='pms_db',0,1)%23` (True)
   -   `http://localhost/pms/admin/inmates/manage_record.php?id=1'-if(database()='wrong',0,1)%23` (False)

This PoC shows how an attacker can use SQL injection to check whether the database name is 'pms_db'. The server response differs based on the condition, indicating SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The comments section of the sourcecodester.com content provides additional information, suggesting issues such as login failures, problems adding new visitors, and other issues, potentially related to database errors/data integrity issues that SQL injection could lead to.
- The github.com content provides a clear description of the vulnerability, a specific vulnerable file, vulnerable line and proof of concept demonstrating the impact, and provides a link to the vulnerable software.

**Summary:**

The identified vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw that can lead to a range of severe consequences, from data breaches to potential system compromise. The direct inclusion of user input into SQL queries without sanitization makes the application extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks.
