- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The product does not implement restrictions on the ability to render within frames on external addresses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames. This allows an attacker to perform clickjacking attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a user into interacting with the application in an unintended way, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs user interaction (UI:R) to successfully exploit the vulnerability, meaning the user must be tricked into performing an action. No special privileges are required to launch the attack (PR:N).
