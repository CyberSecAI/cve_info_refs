Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of multiple vulnerabilities in its Conext™ ComBox product which
was discontinued in January 2020 and is no longer in support.

The Conext™ ComBox is a communication and monitoring device for installers and operators of
Conext solar systems. It features an integrated web server, enabling graphical displays of
system daily, monthly and lifetime energy data to be viewed using a simple web browser or
Android tablet device.

Failure to apply the mitigations provided below may risk Clickjacking, Rate Limiting & Cross-Site
Request Forgery attacks. An attacker who successfully exploits one or more of these
vulnerabilities could trick the product user/admin into performing unintended actions that may
lead to taking over their account or manipulating the station settings.

Affected Product &
Version

Mitigations

Conext™ ComBox product was discontinued as of January 2020
and is no longer in support. Customers should immediately apply the
following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

Conext™ ComBox

All Versions

•  Do not expose the Conext™ Combox directly to the Internet
•  Do not grant network access to unknown computers
•  Computer(s) must be kept up to date with the latest security

patches

Customers should also consider upgrading to the latest product
offering InsightHome & InsightFacility to resolve these issues.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best
Practices document.
