Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an SQL injection vulnerability in the `Prison Management System` application, specifically within the `manage_user.php` file. The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) directly in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-provided data into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `id` parameter from the GET request is being inserted into the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, personal details of inmates, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify, insert, or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By potentially extracting admin credentials, the attacker may gain full access to the application's administration panel and all its features.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter within the URL query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. They do not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `/pms/admin/user/manage_user.php` on line 4:
    ```php
    $user = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM users where id ='{$_GET['id']}' ");
    ```
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a union-based SQL injection:
    ```
    http://localhost/pms/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=-1'%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11%23
    ```
    This payload injects a malicious SQL query that bypasses the intended query structure and returns the name of the database, demonstrating the successful exploitation of the vulnerability.
