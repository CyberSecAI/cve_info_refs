The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Advanced School Management System v1.0" by itsourcecode.com.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input passed through the `my_index` parameter in the `/school/model/get_admin_profile.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches (reading sensitive information)
    - Data modification or deletion
    - Potential full compromise of the application and server

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request to `/school/model/get_admin_profile.php` by manipulating the `my_index` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability. They also need to know the vulnerable file path and parameter. The provided payload demonstrates how to retrieve database name information.
