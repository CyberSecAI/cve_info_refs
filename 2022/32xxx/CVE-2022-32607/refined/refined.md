- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing bounds check in the `aee` component leads to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability due to missing bounds check.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege. An attacker can potentially gain elevated (System) privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attack, no user interaction needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have local access to the device. System execution privileges are needed for successful exploitation.
