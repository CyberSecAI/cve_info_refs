Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, in the `delete_product` function within the `Master.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The application directly incorporates the user-provided `id` parameter into the SQL query without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the user-provided `id` parameter before using it in a database query. This lack of validation enables attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. The provided example demonstrates this by extracting the current database name via the `updatexml` function.
*   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Beyond information disclosure, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete Database Control:** In some scenarios, SQL injection could provide an attacker with complete control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `/psrs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_product`.
*   **`id` parameter:** The `id` parameter in the POST request is the entry point for the SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
*   **HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP request formats.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax and be familiar with SQL injection techniques, specifically `updatexml` in this case.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `delete_product` function.
*   The example provided shows the use of `updatexml` with `concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e)` to leak the database name, which is `psrs_db`.
*   The example also shows a vulnerable POST request with the injected SQL payload.
* The default login credentials for the admin panel are provided as `admin/admin123`
