        "Insecure default configuration",
        "Lack of restriction on access to the management port"

The vulnerability is resolved by binding the management port to localhost by default in version 9.0 of the universal forwarder, preventing remote access to the management service. This is a configuration issue, and the provided documentation guides users on how to mitigate it in versions before 9.0."
