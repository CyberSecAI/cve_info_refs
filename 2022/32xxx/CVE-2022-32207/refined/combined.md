Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
denial of service attack.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

## CVE-2022-32207

# Non-preserved file permissions

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32207.html)

## VULNERABILITY

When curl saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local files, it
makes the operation atomic by finalizing the operation with a rename
from a temporary name to the final target filename.

In that rename operation, it might accidentally *widen* the
permissions for the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to
more users than intended.

## INFO

CVE-2022-32207 was introduced in [commit
b834890a3fa3f52](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b834890a3fa3f52), shipped in curl [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html).

This problem can be worked-around by using a strict umask.

CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html) to and including [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html) and curl >= [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b834890a3fa3f52>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/20f9dd6bae50b>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Make extra precautions to protect saved files (for example strict
umask)

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 17, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on June 20.

libcurl [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html) was released on June 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CREDITS

* Reported-by: Harry Sintonen
* Patched-by: Daniel Stenberg

Thanks a lot!

## CVE-2022-32205

# Set-Cookie denial of service

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32205.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of
`Set-Cookie:` headers in a HTTP response to curl and curl
stores all of them. A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make
subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies
match, create requests that become larger than the threshold that curl
uses internally to avoid sending crazy large requests (1048576 bytes)
and instead returns an error.

This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are
kept, match and have not expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server
on `foo.example.com` can set cookies that also would match
for `bar.example.com`, making it it possible for a "sister
server" to effectively cause a denial of service for a sibling site on
the same second level domain using this method.

## INFO

CVE-2022-32205 was introduced in [commit
ed35d6590e72c23c](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ed35d6590e72c23c), shipped in curl [7.71.0](vuln-7.71.0.html) with the introduction of
the "dynbuf" internally. Before this change, curl had no limit in how
large HTTP request it could generate.

CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.71.0](vuln-7.71.0.html) to and including [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.71.0](vuln-7.71.0.html) and curl >= [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ed35d6590e72c23c>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

We introduce several new limits and thresholds for cookies:

* Send no more than 150 cookies per request
* Cap the max length used for an outgoing `Cookie:`
  header to 8K
* Cap the max number of accepted `Set-Cookie:` header
  fields to 50
* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/48d7064a49148f0394>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use cookies

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 13, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on June 20.

libcurl [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html) was released on June 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-32208

# FTP-KRB bad message verification

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32208.html)

## VULNERABILITY

When curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5, it handles message
verification failures wrongly. This flaw makes it possible for a
Man-In-The-Middle attack to go unnoticed and even allows it to inject
data to the client.

## INFO

CVE-2022-32208 was introduced in [commit
54967d2a3a](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/54967d2a3a), shipped in curl [7.16.4](vuln-7.16.4.html).

This flaw typically makes curl insert `599`  (+
terminating null) into the data where it detects the error, then the
attackers data. It forces the attacker to be somewhat creative to handle
this initial hard-coded 5 byte sequence of "junk".

FTP-KRB is a rarely used feature.

CWE-924: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During
Transmission in a Communication Channel

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.16.4](vuln-7.16.4.html) to and including [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.16.4](vuln-7.16.4.html) and curl >= [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/54967d2a3a>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/6ecdf5136b52af7>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use KRB-FTP

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on June 2, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on June 20.

libcurl [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html) was released on June 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CREDITS

* Reported-by: Harry Sintonen
* Patched-by: Daniel Stenberg

Thanks a lot!

## CVE-2022-32206

# HTTP compression denial of service

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32206.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl supports "chained" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a
server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with
different algorithms. The number of acceptable "links" in this
"decompression chain" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to
insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps.

The use of such a decompression chain could result in a "malloc
bomb", making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap
memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.

## INFO

Automatic content decompression of content needs to be enabled per
transfer but the way Transfer-Encoding works in curl this code path and
problem can be reached with default options.

This flaw exists with just one of the compression algorithms built-in
(gzip, brotli or zstd), but the individual algorithms have different
"exploding" powers.

Both `Content-Encoding:` and
`Transfer-Encoding:` are affected. The vulnerability is more
emphasized over HTTP/1 than HTTP/2 due to different curl internal header
limits.

CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.57.0](vuln-7.57.0.html) to and including [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.57.0](vuln-7.57.0.html) and curl >= [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dbcced8e32b50c06>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The amount of accepted "chained" algorithms is now capped to 5.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3a09fbb7f264c67c43>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 15, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on June 20.

libcurl [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html) was released on June 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
