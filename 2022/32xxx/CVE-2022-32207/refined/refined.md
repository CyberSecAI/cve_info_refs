{
  "CVE-2022-32207": {
    "root_cause": "When curl saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local files, it uses a rename operation to finalize the file save. In this rename operation, it might accidentally widen the permissions for the target file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Preservation of Permissions"
    ],
    "impact": "The updated file might be accessible to more users than intended, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized modification.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor could potentially manipulate the cookie/hsts file write process to gain unauthorized access.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to somehow influence the process that causes curl to save a cookie file, alt-svc or hsts data."
