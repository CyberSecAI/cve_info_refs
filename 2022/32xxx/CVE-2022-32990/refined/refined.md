The provided content is a crash report from GIMP 2.10.30 on Windows, detailing an unhandled exception and stack trace. While this indicates a bug, it doesn't offer specific details about a vulnerability that could be exploited. The crash seems to occur in the `gimp_tool_cursors_get_resource` function, which appears to be related to loading tool cursor resources, but the report doesn't specify a particular input or action that triggers the crash. The root cause is an Access Violation (writing to invalid memory location 0x000000000000008C), but the specific conditions are not described.

Based on the information, the following can be extracted:

*   **Root Cause:** Access Violation (writing to invalid memory location 0x000000000000008C) within the `gimp_tool_cursors_get_resource` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The crash indicates a potential memory safety issue. It is likely caused by an issue with resource management, potentially a null pointer dereference or other memory access error during the process of retrieving tool cursors.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The immediate impact is a crash of the GIMP application. If the crash can be reliably triggered by a malicious input, an attacker could cause a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The report does not specify how to trigger the crash. It is likely related to GIMP's resource handling, so the attack vector could involve crafted image files or other input processed by GIMP.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker would need to provide GIMP with input that triggers the specific conditions leading to the crash. The attacker would need a way to get the crafted input to GIMP (e.g. via opening a file).

However, note that this report does not provide information regarding remote code execution or other security implications. The crash is likely a software defect that may not be exploitable beyond a denial of service scenario, but without further information, it is hard to determine.

**In summary, while the crash report indicates a potential memory safety issue, it does not provide enough details to classify it as a specific, exploitable vulnerability, and the details are insufficient to classify it as related to CVE-2022-32990. Therefore, the response would be NOINFO.**
