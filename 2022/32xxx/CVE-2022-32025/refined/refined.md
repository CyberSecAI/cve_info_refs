The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Car Rental Management System v1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application's `view_car.php` page is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter. The application does not sanitize or properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability exists in `view_car.php` via the `id` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (e.g., extracting database names, table structures, user information)
    - Data modification/deletion
    - Potential compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious HTTP GET request to `/car-rental-management-system/admin/view_car.php` with a crafted `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position is required, they just need network access to the application.

The provided content gives a detailed exploit example, including the vulnerable file, parameter, and a proof-of-concept payload that extracts the database name. It also includes the corresponding HTTP request.
