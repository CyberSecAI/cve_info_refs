Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-32119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of multiple **unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities** in the Arox system. The application fails to properly validate or sanitize uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files, including those containing malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of restrictions on file uploads, allowing any file type to be uploaded.
*   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The application does not validate the uploaded file type. It relies on the filename extension, which can be easily spoofed.
*   **Lack of Content Validation:** The application does not inspect the content of uploaded files to verify that they match the claimed file type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading PHP files containing malicious code, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This can lead to a variety of severe consequences, including:
    *   Full compromise of the server
    *   Data breaches
    *   Denial-of-service attacks
    *   Malware distribution

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited through multiple different pages of the application, which include both authenticated and unauthenticated pages. 
*   **Authenticated Pages:**
    *   `localhost/office_admin/?pid=54&action=add`
    *   `localhost/office_admin/?pid=22&action=school_details`
*   **Unauthenticated Pages:**
    *  `localhost/greatbritain/greatbritain/upload_stafffille.php`
*   The attack involves crafting a multipart form request containing a file with a malicious payload (e.g., PHP code) disguised with a valid image extension (.jpg). The application saves the file to the server without sanitization, and the attacker can then access the uploaded file to execute the code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests and multipart form data.
*   **PHP Knowledge (for Arbitrary Code Execution):** For achieving code execution, the attacker needs to be able to write malicious code in PHP, or another suitable server-side language.
*   **Authentication (for some pages):** For some specific pages, the attacker would need to have valid credentials. Other pages are unauthenticated.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content gives specific examples of vulnerable file upload forms and illustrates the structure of the malicious HTTP request.
*   The exploit uses a technique of including PHP code in a file disguised as an image using a .jpg extension, which is then uploaded.

In summary, this CVE describes a serious vulnerability that allows for unrestricted file uploads, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This can have severe security implications.
