Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `id` parameter of the `/ffos/admin/categories/view_category.php` file, allowing for arbitrary SQL queries to be injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Unsanitized input: The `id` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   Lack of input validation: The application does not validate the format or content of the `id` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Database information disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., database name, table structures, user credentials).
*   Data modification: An attacker could potentially modify or delete data stored in the database.
*   Potential for complete system compromise: In some cases, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server through database-related features.

**Attack vectors:**
*   HTTP GET request to `/ffos/admin/categories/view_category.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privilege or credential to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable file is `/ffos/admin/categories/view_category.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
*   The provided example payload demonstrates how to extract the length of the database name using `length(database())`.
*   The attacker can determine the database name by checking the content length of the response for different values of `length(database())`.
*   The provided screenshots show different content lengths when the payload returns true vs false.
*   The backend login credentials are provided (admin/admin123) which allows for easier verification of the vulnerability.
