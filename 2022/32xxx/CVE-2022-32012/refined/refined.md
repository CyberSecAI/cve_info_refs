Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `/eris/admin/employee/index.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, a union-based SQL injection is demonstrated, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database. The provided payload shows extraction of the database name, but an attacker could retrieve any information available in the database.
*   **Database Manipulation:** In addition to extracting data, an attacker may also modify or delete data, depending on the permissions of the database user used by the application.
*   **System Compromise:** If the database user used by the web application has sufficient privileges, an attacker could potentially compromise the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint: `/eris/admin/employee/index.php`. The malicious SQL payload is injected through the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL, and the vulnerable parameter.
*   **SQL Injection knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques in order to craft an appropriate payload.
