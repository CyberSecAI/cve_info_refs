Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.18.4 and 1.17.12, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 9 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: improper sanitization of Transfer-Encoding header

  The HTTP/1 client accepted some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers as indicating a "chunked" encoding. This could potentially allow for request smuggling, but only if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly failed to reject the header as invalid.

  This is CVE-2022-1705 and <https://go.dev/issue/53188>.
* When httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP was called with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy would set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to its documentation. In the more usual case where a Director function set the X-Forwarded-For header value to nil, ReverseProxy would leave the header unmodified as expected.

  This is <https://go.dev/issue/53423> and CVE-2022-32148.

  Thanks to Christian Mehlmauer for reporting this issue.
* compress/gzip: stack exhaustion in Reader.Read

  Calling Reader.Read on an archive containing a large number of concatenated 0-length compressed files can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30631 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53168>.
* encoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Unmarshal

  Calling Unmarshal on a XML document into a Go struct which has a nested field that uses the `any` field tag can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30633 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53611>.
* encoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Skip

  Calling Decoder.Skip when parsing a deeply nested XML document can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  The Go Security team discovered this issue, and it was independently reported by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost.

  This is CVE-2022-28131 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53614>.
* encoding/gob: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Decode

  Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30635 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53615>.
* path/filepath: stack exhaustion in Glob

  Calling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-30632 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53416>.
* io/fs: stack exhaustion in Glob

  Calling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30630 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53415>.
* go/parser: stack exhaustion in all Parse\* functions

  Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested types or declarations can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-1962 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53616>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.18.4>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.18.4` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Michael and Heschi for the Go team

# Vulnerability Report: GO-2022-0520

standard library

* CVE-2022-32148
* Affects:
  net/http
* Published: Jul 28, 2022
* Modified: May 20, 2024

Client IP adresses may be unintentionally exposed via X-Forwarded-For headers.
When httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP is called with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy sets the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to its documentation.
In the more usual case where a Director function sets the X-Forwarded-For header value to nil, ReverseProxy leaves the header unmodified as expected.

### What did you do?

In [#38079](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38079) a check was added to not leak the IP if the `X-Forwarded-For` header is nil.

Doing this does not seem to work as it always return an empty string slice

```
r.Header["X-Forwarded-For"] = nil
fmt.Printf("%T", r.Header["X-Forwarded-For"])
```

Output:

```
[]string

```
### What did you expect to see?

The header is not added

### What did you see instead?

The IP header is always added as it seems impossible to set the value to `nil`
