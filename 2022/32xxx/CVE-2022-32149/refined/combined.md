Version v0.3.8 of [golang.org/x/text](http://golang.org/x/text) fixes a vulnerability in the [golang.org/x/text/language](http://golang.org/x/text/language) package which could cause a denial of service.

An attacker can craft an Accept-Language header which ParseAcceptLanguage will take significant time to parse.

This issue was discovered by OSS-Fuzz and reported to us by Adam Korczynski (ADA Logics), and is tracked as CVE-2022-32149 and <https://go.dev/issue/56152>.

Cheers,
Roland on behalf of the Go team

## Package

([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.3.8

## Patched versions

0.3.8

## Description

The BCP 47 tag parser has quadratic time complexity due to inherent aspects of its design. Since the parser is, by design, exposed to untrusted user input, this can be leveraged to force a program to consume significant time parsing Accept-Language headers. The parser cannot be easily rewritten to fix this behavior for various reasons. Instead the solution implemented in this CL is to limit the total complexity of tags passed into ParseAcceptLanguage by limiting the number of dashes in the string to 1000. This should be more than enough for the majority of real world use cases, where the number of tags being sent is likely to be in the single digits.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@rolandshoemaker](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5080674?u=c9a1ba53e27929b8d12ab031c053f540a9693db3&v=4&size=48)[rolandshoemaker](https://github.com/rolandshoemaker)opened [on Oct 11, 2022](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56152#issue-1404859551)

The BCP 47 tag parser has quadratic time complexity due to inherent aspects of its design. Since the parser is, by design, exposed to untrusted user input, this can be leveraged to force a program to consume significant time parsing Accept-Language headers.

This is a PRIVATE issue for [CVE-2022-32149](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-69ch-w2m2-3vjp "CVE-2022-32149"), tracked in <http://b/238189978> and fixed by <http://tg/1565112>
