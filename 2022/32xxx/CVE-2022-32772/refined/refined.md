{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `msg` parameter in the `showAlertMessage` function within `objects/functions.php` is not properly sanitized before being output in the footer, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
      "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser by crafting a malicious URL that includes the `msg` parameter. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the payload in the `msg` parameter and tricks a user into clicking the link.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload. User interaction is required for successful exploitation (i.e., the victim must click on the crafted link)."
