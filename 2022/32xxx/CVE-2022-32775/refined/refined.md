- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the calculation of the buffer size for handling HTTP requests to `/action/ipcamRecordPost`. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of `atoi` to parse the number of filenames to be deleted from the request body. This number is then used in a calculation to determine the size of the buffer to allocate. A large number supplied for the count can overflow a 32 bit integer, which leads to allocating a smaller buffer than expected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Integer Overflow: The multiplication of the attacker-controlled `num_elems` and `elem_size` can lead to a small heap allocation due to an integer overflow.
    - Heap Corruption: The smaller-than-expected heap buffer then receives a larger copy of data from the original HTTP request, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution as demonstrated by control over the program counter during testing.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/action/ipcamRecordPost` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be authenticated to the web interface of the Abode iota device.
    - The web interface must be enabled. While the report mentions the web server is disabled by default and not intended for end-user use, it also notes that other vulnerabilities ([TALOS-2022-1552](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1552) or [TALOS-2022-1553](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1553)) can be used to enable it remotely.
