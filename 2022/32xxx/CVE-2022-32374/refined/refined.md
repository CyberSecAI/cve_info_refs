Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `/school/model/get_subject_routing.php` file of the Advanced School Management System v1.0. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization for the `id` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow the attacker to:
    *   Extract sensitive database information (in this case, the database name was obtained)
    *   Potentially modify or delete data
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the application
    *   Compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the system
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the `/school/model/get_subject_routing.php` endpoint. The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is explicitly required to trigger this particular vulnerability, as the vulnerable URL is accessed directly.

**Technical Details**
The provided payload demonstrates how the attacker can inject SQL code using a `UNION SELECT` statement:
`/school/model/get_subject_routing.php?id=-23%20union%20select%201,2,database(),4,5--+`

This payload leverages the `id` parameter to inject the following SQL:
```sql
-23 union select 1,2,database(),4,5--+
```

This SQL injection allows the attacker to retrieve the current database name. The `--+` is used to comment out the remaining part of the original query and prevent SQL syntax errors.
