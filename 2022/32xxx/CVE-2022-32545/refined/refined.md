{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An undefined behavior due to a conversion outside the range of representable values of type 'unsigned char' was found in the psd file handling.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code attempts to cast a signed ssize_t value to an unsigned char without proper bounds checking, potentially leading to out-of-range values."
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability can lead to a negative impact on application availability or other problems related to undefined behavior when processing crafted or untrusted PSD files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By providing a specially crafted PSD file to ImageMagick, an attacker can trigger the out-of-range conversion during processing."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PSD file to ImageMagick. This could involve user interaction or an automated process that uses ImageMagick to process untrusted files."
