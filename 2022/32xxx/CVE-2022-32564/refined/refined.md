The provided content is related to CVE-2022-32564.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `couchbase-cli: server-eshell` command was leaking the Cluster Manager cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `server-eshell` command in `couchbase-cli` was not properly securing the Cluster Manager cookie, leading to its exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious actor could potentially use the leaked Cluster Manager cookie to gain unauthorized access and control over the Couchbase cluster. This could lead to a complete compromise of the cluster.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to use the `couchbase-cli` and the vulnerable `server-eshell` command to trigger the leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have access to the `couchbase-cli` tool and be able to execute the `server-eshell` command. This implies that they already have some level of access to the system where the tool is installed or be able to execute it remotely.
