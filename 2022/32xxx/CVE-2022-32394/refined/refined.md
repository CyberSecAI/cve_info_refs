Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32394:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection vulnerability in the `view_inmate.php` file of the Prison Management System.
- The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) directly in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize the `id` parameter passed via the URL's GET request before using it in the SQL query.
- Lack of input validation: The application does not validate or sanitize user inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database (e.g., inmate information).
- It could also allow an attacker to potentially modify or delete data, or in severe cases, gain control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP GET request, by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability since it is in the `$_GET['id']` parameter.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge about SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$qry = $conn->query("SELECT *,concat(lastname,', ', firstname, coalesce(concat(' ', middlename), '')) as `name` from `inmate_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}' ");
```

The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using an error-based approach.
- The PoC injects a conditional statement within the query to check the current database:
`http://localhost/pms/admin/?page=inmates/view_inmate&id=1'-if(database()='pms_db',0,1)%23`

- If the database name is `pms_db`, it will return 0; otherwise, it will return 1.
- The PoC shows how the attacker can confirm if the SQL injection exists and can manipulate the database by using conditional statement in the query.

The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, which would only point out the vulnerability and its type.
