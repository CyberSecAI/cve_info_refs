Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application directly uses unsanitized user input from the `$_GET['id']` parameter in a SQL query within the `view_visit.php` file.

**Weakness:** Failure to sanitize user-supplied data before incorporating it into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query structure.

**Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is present in the `view_visit.php` file in the admin panel of the Prison Management System. The vulnerable code is located at line 4 of `/pms/admin/visits/view_visit.php`, which takes the id parameter from the URL via `$_GET['id']` directly and uses it in a SQL query without sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, specifically accessing the `view_visit.php` page with a crafted `id` parameter. It seems the attacker also needs to have some understanding of SQL to craft the injection payloads. No special access is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Exposure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including inmate information, visitor details, user credentials, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues or disruption of the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database configuration and privileges, a successful SQL injection could lead to further compromises.
*   **System Takeover:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to gain control of the database server itself by exploiting advanced SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$qry = $conn->query("SELECT v.*, i.code, concat(i.lastname,', ', i.firstname, coalesce(concat(' ', i.middlename), '')) as `inmate` from `visit_list` v inner join inmate_list i on v.inmate_id = i.id where v.id = '{$_GET['id']}' ");
```

The attacker can inject SQL code using the `id` parameter. The provided proof of concept uses an error-based SQL injection:

```
http://localhost/pms/admin/visits/view_visit.php?id=1'/**/-/**/if(database()='pms_db',0,1)%23
```

This payload attempts to use the database() function, to check the name of the current database and if the condition is true, it will not cause an error, otherwise it will return a result and cause an error that will be visible in the web page which will confirm the SQL Injection.

The example shows a basic method for confirming the SQL injection through error-based injection, and it is implied that more complex attacks could be performed using this same vulnerability vector.
