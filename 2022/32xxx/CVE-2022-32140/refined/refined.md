- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the CODESYS Control runtime system's improper handling of length parameters within crafted requests. Specifically, a request may contain an incorrect data length for the associated structured data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency, leading to a buffer over-read.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability leads to an internal buffer over-read, causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request with an incorrect data length for structured data to the CODESYS Control V2 runtime system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the controller, or the controller must not have a level 1 online password configured. Low skill level is required to exploit. Remote exploitation is possible.
