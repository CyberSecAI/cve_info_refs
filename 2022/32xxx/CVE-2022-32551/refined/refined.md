- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in handling request paths allows unauthenticated users to access arbitrary web-root files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated arbitrary web-root file disclosure. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the application's improper handling of request paths when accessing files under `/sample/`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive web-root files, such as `/WEB-INF/web.xml` and `/META-INF/web.xml`. This could lead to information disclosure, potentially revealing configuration details and sensitive data about the application.
- **Attack vectors:** By browsing to specific URLs, such as `/sample/WEB-INF/web.xml` or `/sample/META-INF/web.xml`, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.
