{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application has an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the 'edit' function of the TEACHER module, specifically in the file picture upload functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability, lack of proper file extension validation on the server-side.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE) can be achieved by uploading a malicious PHP file (webshell).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the file upload functionality of the teacher editing section of the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have administrative access to the application to access the teacher module and edit teacher profiles. The attacker also needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite). The attacker needs to know or guess a valid admin credential (suarez081119@gmail.com/12345).",
  "Additional Information": "The application uses client-side validation to check file extensions. This validation can be bypassed by changing the file extension to an accepted one such as png, and then changing it back to php using Burp Suite."
