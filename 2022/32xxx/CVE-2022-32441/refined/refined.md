The provided content describes a fuzzing session of IDA Pro 6.6 using `msfvenom` generated payloads, resulting in multiple crashes due to access violations within `memcpy` and `malloc`. This does not directly correspond to a specific CVE. The content provides details of crashes and debugging information, but it's not about a specific vulnerability with a CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the generation of malicious input files using `msfvenom` which then lead to memory access violation during execution of the target application, in this case IDA Pro 6.6. The specific root cause varies between the cases, with issues arising in `memcpy`, `malloc` and `rep movs` calls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to the manipulation of `memcpy` parameters.
- Memory corruption during allocation via `malloc`.
- Read access violation during a block data move using `rep movs`.
- Tainted data controlling subsequent write addresses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application crash.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution (as indicated by the "Probably Exploitable" classification by `!exploitable`).

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting specific input files using `msfvenom` and then processing these files using the vulnerable application (IDA Pro 6.6)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to generate malicious input files using `msfvenom`.
- Ability to provide the crafted malicious files to the vulnerable application (IDA Pro 6.6).

The content provides more detailed information than a standard CVE description would, including:
- Specific crash locations in `msvcrt!memcpy`, `msvcrt!malloc` and `MSVCR100!memcpy`.
- Debugging output, including register states, and stack traces.
- Analysis using the `!exploitable` tool to determine the potential for exploitation.
