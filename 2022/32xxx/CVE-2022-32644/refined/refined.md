- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper synchronization in the `vow` component leads to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation does not require user interaction, and requires system execution privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local attacker with system execution privileges
