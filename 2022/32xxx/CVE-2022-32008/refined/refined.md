The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Complete Online Job Search System v1.0".

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization when handling the `id` parameter in the `/eris/admin/vacancy/index.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection. Specifically, it's an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can extract sensitive database information, including the database name `erisdb`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id` GET parameter in the `/eris/admin/vacancy/index.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without authentication. The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with a SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.

The provided content includes a sample exploit payload, which uses `UNION SELECT` to leak the database name, along with the vulnerable URL parameter.
