- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Certificate Validation
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The EcoStruxureâ„¢ Cybersecurity Admin Expert (CAE) software does not properly validate certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - The CAE software might provide incorrect data to end users while configuring devices.
    - Credentials could be leaked, allowing an attacker to log into the configuration tool and compromise other devices on the network.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the local network to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. User interaction is required. The attacker needs to be able to manipulate network traffic.
