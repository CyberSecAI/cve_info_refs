Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-32404

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Prison Management System. Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` parameter is directly included in an SQL query without prior validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure handling of the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the `/pms/admin/inmates/manage_inmate.php` file. The provided code snippet `$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * from \`inmate_list\` where id = '{$_GET['id']}' ");` shows that user-supplied input is directly concatenated into the SQL query, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to various consequences, including:
    - **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database, including inmate details, personal information, and other confidential data.
    - **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, depending on the database setup and user permissions, an attacker may escalate their privileges within the database.
    - **Denial of Service:** It is possible to overload the database, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `/pms/admin/?page=inmates/manage_inmate` endpoint, and control the `id` parameter.
- No authentication is explicitly stated as required for this exploit, indicating the vulnerability is likely accessible without credentials.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates an error-based SQL injection.
- The PoC payloads use `if(database()='pms_db',0,1)` to verify the database name.
- The application uses `PHP` and `MySQL`.
- The vulnerable code is found in `/pms/admin/inmates/manage_inmate.php:3`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `$_GET['id']`.
