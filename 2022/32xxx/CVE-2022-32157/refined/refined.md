{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Splunk Enterprise deployment servers prior to version 9.0 do not enforce authentication for downloading forwarder bundles, allowing unauthenticated access to these bundles.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can download forwarder bundles. These bundles may contain sensitive information such as certificates and passwords, potentially leading to further compromise of the environment.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based; an attacker can send a request to the deployment server to download the forwarder bundles.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any credentials to access the forwarder bundles. They only need to be able to reach the Splunk deployment server over the network.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading the deployment server and the universal forwarders to version 9.0 or higher and enabling authentication for deployment servers and clients."
