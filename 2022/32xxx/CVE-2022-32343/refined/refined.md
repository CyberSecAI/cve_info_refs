The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability found in the Hospital's Patient Records Management System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `/hprms/admin/room_types/manage_room_type.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `id` parameter of `/hprms/admin/room_types/manage_room_type.php`.
- Lack of input sanitization and parameter validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., database name as shown in the provided payload) by injecting SQL queries.
- The attacker can potentially modify or delete data from the database.
- The vulnerability could potentially be used to gain unauthorized access to the system if the SQL injection is exploited further.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of the `/hprms/admin/room_types/manage_room_type.php` page.
- The specific attack vector is a crafted URL containing a SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, as it's triggered directly through the URL parameters.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required.
