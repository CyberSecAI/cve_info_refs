{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials or other confidential data, by injecting malicious SQL queries.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to `/eris/admin/user/index.php?view=edit&id=` with a crafted SQL injection payload in the 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and they need to know the vulnerable endpoint and the parameter to inject into."
