Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2022-32955:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- DMA (Direct Memory Access) attacks on the shared buffer used by both System Management Mode (SMM) and non-SMM code within the `NvmExpressDxe` driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition due to the shared buffer being accessed by both SMM and non-SMM code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Corruption of System Management RAM (SMRAM).
- Escalation of privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- DMA attacks targeting the `NvmExpressDxe` shared buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform DMA attacks on the affected system.
- The attacker needs to have a low level of privilege.
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have some degree of access to the system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Insyde engineering.
- Fixes were implemented in the following kernel versions:
  - Kernel 5.2: 05.27.38
  - Kernel 5.3: 05.36.38
  - Kernel 5.4: 05.44.38
  - Kernel 5.5: 05.52.38
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-367.

This information provides more context than the generic CVE description, clarifying the specific component (`NvmExpressDxe`), the mechanism (DMA attacks), and the resulting impacts (SMRAM corruption and privilege escalation).
