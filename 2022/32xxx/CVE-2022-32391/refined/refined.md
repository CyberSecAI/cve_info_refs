Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-32391

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `view_action.php` file of the Prison Management System. Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerability due to the insecure use of the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the `action_list` table or other parts of the database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Through crafted SQL injection payloads, an attacker can modify or delete existing data in the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to more severe outcomes, including arbitrary code execution on the server by exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request.
*   **Manipulated `id` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter within the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required** The vulnerable endpoint can be accessed without authentication.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `/pms/admin/actions/view_action.php:4`:

    ```php
    $qry = $conn->query("SELECT * from `action_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}' and delete_flag = 0 ");
    ```

*   **Proof of Concept Payloads:**
    *   **Error Based:** `http://localhost/pms/admin/actions/view_action.php?id=1'-if(database()/**/=/**/'pms_db',0,1)%23`
    *   **Time Based:** `http://localhost/pms/admin/actions/view_action.php?id=1'-if(database()/**/like/**/'pms_db',0,sleep(1))%23`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information includes examples of error-based and time-based SQL injection payloads which can be used to verify and exploit the vulnerability.
* The vulnerable application is the Prison Management System, version 1.0
* The application was obtained from `sourcecodester.com`.
* The vulnerability is present in the `$_GET['id']` parameter of the `/pms/admin/actions/view_action.php` file.
