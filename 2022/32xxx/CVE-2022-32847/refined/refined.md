  "CVE-2022-32847": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a result of insufficient checks within the Wi-Fi component.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Lack of proper bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause unexpected system termination or corrupt kernel memory. This can lead to a denial-of-service or potentially other more severe consequences such as arbitrary code execution by a malicious user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a compromised or maliciously constructed Wi-Fi network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, likely within range of the vulnerable device's Wi-Fi connection, to intercept or manipulate network traffic."
