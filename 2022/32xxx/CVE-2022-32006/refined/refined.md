Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `view_service.php` file of the Badminton Center Management System. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `view_service.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data disclosure: An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by manipulating SQL queries.
- Data manipulation: An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
- Potential for complete compromise: Depending on database configuration and permissions, a successful injection could lead to complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `/bcms/admin/services/view_service.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- No specific authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability according to the report.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable file: `/bcms/admin/services/view_service.php`
- Vulnerable parameter: `id`
- Example payload: `/bcms/admin/services/view_service.php?id=2'%20and%20length(database())%20=7--+`
- The attacker uses the `length(database())` function to perform a blind SQL injection, determining the length of the database name by observing the response content length.
- The vulnerability is confirmed using a blind SQL injection technique, where the attacker infers the result of the SQL query based on changes in the response's content length.
