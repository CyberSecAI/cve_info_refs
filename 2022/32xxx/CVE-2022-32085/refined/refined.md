Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32085:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during the cleanup phase of the `Item_func_in` object, specifically within the `Item::cleanup_processor`. This occurs during the processing of a virtual column expression.
- The issue is related to how MariaDB handles certain complex expressions within virtual columns, particularly when using functions like `IN` and potentially other functions that involve comparisons or type conversions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Use-after-free/use-after-poison:** The crash and backtrace indicate a memory corruption issue, likely a use-after-free or use-after-poison. The `Item_func_in::cleanup` is called on an object that has already been freed or invalidated, leading to a segmentation fault.
- **Improper cleanup:** The `cleanup` function for `Item_func_in` is not correctly handling the deallocation or state management of resources associated with complex virtual column expressions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a server crash, resulting in a denial of service. The provided logs show a segmentation fault (signal 11) leading to the termination of the `mysqld` process.
- **Potential for other issues:** While not explicitly stated, use-after-free vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited for more serious issues, such as arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

- **SQL Injection:** The provided PoC demonstrates that the vulnerability is triggered by crafting specific SQL statements that include a virtual column with a complex expression, involving `IN`, `GREATEST`, `REPEAT`, and numeric operations.
- The vulnerability can be triggered through standard database interactions and does not require any specific privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Database access:** An attacker needs the ability to execute SQL queries on a vulnerable MariaDB server. This typically implies network access to the database and valid user credentials.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable syntax:** The attacker needs to know how to craft SQL queries with the specific combination of virtual columns and functions to trigger the bug, as shown in the PoC.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue affects multiple versions of MariaDB: 10.2 (EOL), 10.3 (EOL), 10.4 (EOL), 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7 (EOL).
- The bug is related to the "Virtual Columns" component.
- The vulnerability is triggered during a cleanup process for virtual column expressions.
- The provided coredump shows the crash originates in `Item_func_in::cleanup`.
- The fix is implemented in versions 10.3.35, 10.4.25, 10.5.16, 10.6.8, and 10.7.4.

**NetApp Advisory:**

- NetApp's advisory lists this CVE as one of several MariaDB vulnerabilities affecting their products (specifically, StorageGRID).
- NetApp rates this as a HIGH severity issue with a CVSS score of 7.5, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. This indicates a remotely exploitable vulnerability with no required user interaction that can cause denial of service.

**Debian Security Update:**

- Debian's security update (DLA-3114-1) includes a fix for this CVE along with other vulnerabilities, by upgrading the MariaDB version to 10.3.36.

In summary, CVE-2022-32085 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in MariaDB caused by a use-after-free issue in the cleanup process for complex virtual column expressions. It can be triggered by a user with database access by crafting specific SQL statements.
