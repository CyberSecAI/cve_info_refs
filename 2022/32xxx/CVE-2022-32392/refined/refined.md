Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `$_GET['id']` parameter within the `manage_action.php` file of the Prison Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the unsanitized `$_GET['id']` parameter into an SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Potential for Full System Compromise:** Depending on the database user privileges, a successful SQL injection can lead to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `manage_action.php` script with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques to construct malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    $qry = $conn->query("SELECT * from `action_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}' and `delete_flag` = 0 ");
    ```
    This shows that the `id` parameter, taken directly from the GET request, is inserted directly into the SQL query without any sanitization.
*   The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) payloads demonstrate two types of SQL injection:
    *   **Error-Based SQL Injection:** `http://localhost/pms/admin/actions/manage_action.php?id=1'-if(database()/**/=/**/'pms_db',0,1)%23` This payload attempts to trigger an error message revealing information about the database.
    *   **Time-Based SQL Injection:** `http://localhost/pms/admin/actions/manage_action.php?id=1'-if(database()/**/like/**/'pms_db',0,sleep(1))%23` This payload attempts to introduce a time delay based on a conditional check, which can be used to extract information.
*   The provided screenshots (`cve-2022-32392_true.png` and `cve-2022-32392_false.png`) are not helpful, only showing a page and not an error.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable software is identified as "Prison Management System 1.0," available on sourcecodester.com.
* The comments on the sourcecodester page indicate several users having issues with the system, particularly related to visitor management and login, but do not provide any further information about the SQL injection vulnerability.

This information provides a good understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability described in the provided content and aligns with the description of CVE-2022-32392.
