Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE Description:** The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability, which aligns with the purpose of a CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `view_menu.php` file. The application directly includes this unsanitized input into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php?id=`
- The `id` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can use SQL injection techniques to extract sensitive data, potentially including user credentials, menu information, and other application data.
- An attacker could modify database records, potentially altering the prices of food items, or creating new administrative accounts.
- A successful SQL injection attack could potentially allow the attacker to gain complete control over the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed through an HTTP GET request to the `/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php` endpoint.
- The attack vector is the `id` parameter in the query string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- The attacker may need to be logged into the admin panel to exploit this vulnerability, as the vulnerable endpoint resides under `/admin/menus/`. However, the provided information doesn't specify if authentication is required to reach this specific endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable file is `/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php`.
- The injection point is the `id` parameter.
- The attacker can use SQL injection payloads to manipulate database queries, for instance, the payload `1' and length(database()) = 7--+` is used to determine the length of the database name.
- The response of the query differs in length, allowing an attacker to brute-force database information.
- The default admin login is `admin/admin123`, which should not be considered as part of the vulnerability but is an additional security concern with this system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a specific example of a SQL injection payload that can be used to determine the length of the database name.
- The content also mentions a specific database name `ffos_db` with a length of 7.
- The report suggests that an attacker can infer the length of the database name via changes in the content length of the response.
- The report includes screenshots illustrating the different response lengths based on the SQL injection payloads provided.
- The report includes details that are beyond what is expected of a standard CVE description, including the specific vulnerable file, vulnerable parameter, payload examples, and information about how the attacker can confirm the database length.
