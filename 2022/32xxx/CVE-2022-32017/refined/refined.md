The provided content is related to CVE-2022-32017.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the 'Complete Online Job Search System v1.0' application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `SEARCH` parameter within the `/eris/index.php?q=result&searchfor=bytitle` endpoint. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to:
-   Data exfiltration of sensitive database information.
-   Database manipulation (e.g., modification, deletion of data).
-   Privilege escalation.
-   Complete compromise of the database server.
In this specific case the attacker is able to extract the database name.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the endpoint `/eris/index.php?q=result&searchfor=bytitle` by manipulating the `SEARCH` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application's endpoint.
-  The attacker doesn't require any prior authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious SQL injection payload.
