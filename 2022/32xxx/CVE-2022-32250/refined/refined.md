{
  "CVE-2022-32250": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly clean up when a lookup or dynset expression is encountered as a subexpression of a `NFT_MSG_NEWSET` command. Specifically, the `nf_tables_newset()` function does not properly handle non-stateful subexpressions within a set, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Improper cleanup of resources",
      "Incorrect flag check for stateful expressions"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation to root.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation via netlink sockets",
      "Requires the ability to create user/net namespaces"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to create user/net namespaces and send specially crafted netlink messages to trigger the vulnerability. This is possible through a local unprivileged user with access to the network namespace creation."
