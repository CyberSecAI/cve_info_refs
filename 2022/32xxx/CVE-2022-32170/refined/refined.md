Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32170:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `www.mend.io_acce0f56_20250115_222607.html` and `www.mend.io_999a0047_20250115_222607.html` is directly related to CVE-2022-32170. These pages contain a description of the vulnerability, its technical details, affected versions, and other relevant information.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the "Bytebase" application's failure to restrict access to admin projects based on user privileges.  Specifically, a low-privilege user can access admin projects through the `/api/project?user=${userId}` endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The application does not properly enforce access control policies, allowing unauthorized users to view projects they should not have access to.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** A low-privilege user can view the names and details of projects created by administrators, potentially exposing sensitive information about the organizationâ€™s projects, database configurations and related data.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** The attack is conducted over the network by manipulating HTTP requests to the application's API endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Low Privilege User Account:**  An attacker needs to have a valid user account in the application, even a low-privilege account, is sufficient for exploitation.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the application's API, implying network access to the system hosting the application.
    *   **Request Manipulation:**  The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify the HTTP request, specifically the `user` parameter in the `/api/project` endpoint (e.g. using a proxy tool like Burp Suite).

**3. Technical Details & PoC:**

The Mend.io content provides a detailed Proof-of-Concept (PoC):

1.  Login into the application as both "Admin" and a regular "User".
2.  Capture the HTTP request for retrieving "projects" as an "Admin".
3.  Extract the `user id` from the captured request.
4.  Capture the request for projects as the regular "User".
5.  Modify the `user id` in the user's request to that of the admin.
6.  Send the modified request.
7.  The regular "User" will be able to view "admin" projects.

**4. Affected Versions:**

*   Bytebase versions 0.1.0 through 1.0.4 are affected.

**5. Fix Information:**

*   No fix was available at the time the vulnerability was reported.

**6. CVSS v3.1 Metrics:**

*   **Base Score:** 4.3
*   **Attack Vector (AV):** Network
*   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low
*   **Privileges Required (PR):** Low
*   **User Interaction (UI):** None
*   **Scope (S):** Unchanged
*   **Confidentiality (C):** Low
*   **Integrity (I):** None
*   **Availability (A):** None

**7. Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub file `project.ts` is referenced as being related to the vulnerability.  Specifically, lines 166-197 are highlighted in the Mend.io content. This file likely contains the vulnerable code related to project access.

**Summary:**

The provided content confirms the presence of a vulnerability in the Bytebase application (CVE-2022-32170), which allows low-privileged users to view admin-level project information due to improper authorization. The attack vector is network-based and requires a low level of attacker skill. The provided information is sufficient to understand the core of the vulnerability and the method of exploitation, which can be considered more detailed than what might be found in a basic CVE entry.
