  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'Request New Password' feature in OTRS is susceptible to timing attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure due to timing differences in processing valid and invalid usernames.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can determine if a given username exists within the OTRS system by observing response time variations, which could assist in reconnaissance and further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is network-based, exploiting the 'Request New Password' functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need prior authentication or special access. They only need to be able to interact with the 'Request New Password' feature over the network."
