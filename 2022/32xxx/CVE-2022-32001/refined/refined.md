Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `view_product.php` file, allowing for SQL injection. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in a database query without any form of escaping or parameterization.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists because user-supplied input is not validated and sanitized before being used in SQL query.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain complete control of the database server.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `/bcms/admin/products/view_product.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No prior authentication is needed to access `view_product.php`. The provided admin login information is not relevant for exploiting the described vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

The provided markdown file shows a successful SQL injection attack by using the payload `id=5' and length(database()) =7--+`. The attacker can use this information to determine the database name. The length of the content response is different based on the boolean result of the injected sql query `length(database()) = 7` confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
