{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "DMA transactions which are targeted at input buffers used for the SmmResourceCheckDxe software SMI handler.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SMRAM corruption (a TOCTOU attack) due to DMA transactions targeting input buffers of the software SMI handler.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "SMRAM corruption which could lead to arbitrary code execution in SMM and potentially system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "DMA transactions targeting specific input buffers in the SmmResourceCheckDxe driver.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate DMA transactions. This likely requires privileged access, as indicated by the CVSS vector string 'PR:H'."
