The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Complete Online Job Search System v1.0".

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter in the `/eris/admin/applicants/index.php` script. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    -  Data exfiltration (retrieval of sensitive data from the database)
    -  Data modification (modification or deletion of data)
    -  Complete compromise of the database
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP GET request to `/eris/admin/applicants/index.php` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the SQLi vulnerability itself, but they require administrative credentials to access the vulnerable page. The default login for the backend is `admin/admin`, also provided in the document.
