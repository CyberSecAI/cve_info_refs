# Halborn MetaMask “Demonic” Vulnerability Discovery

---

## Introduction

The Demonic Vulnerability ([CVE-2022-32969](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32969)) was discovered by Halborn and we have worked with MetaMask, Phantom, Brave, xDefi, and others to help the community remediate the issue. This announcement on June 15, 2022 follows a good faith effort to contact all affected teams and assist in mitigation.
For a high level overview refer to our [blog post](https://halborn.com/halborn-discovers-critical-vulnerability-affecting-crypto-wallet-browser-extensions/).

## Description and Overview

[CVE-2022-32969](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32969): Insecure permissions vulnerability in MetaMask and other browser extension cryptocurrency wallets allows an attacker to access a user’s secret recovery phrase on disk via remote or physical access.

Both Firefox and Chromium based browsers save the contents of all non-password input fields to disk *unencrypted* as part of the “Restore Session” feature. Browser extension cryptocurrency wallets that use an input field for a [BIP39 mnemonic](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase) can cause the secret recovery phrase to be stored on disk in plain text where an attacker can retrieve it and gain access to the wallet.

Additionally, an attacker with equal or greater permissions than the user may be able to retrieve the mnemonic phrase directly from memory.

## For Browser-Wallet Users

### User Guidance

The risk is present if the following conditions were met:

* The Secret Recovery Phrase was imported into a browser extension wallet using a device that is no longer in the user’s possession or is logically compromised
* The hard drive is unencrypted
* The user used the “Show Secret Recovery Phrase” checkbox to view the seed phrase on-screen during import

![import_a_wallet_with_secret_eace14debc.png](https://cdn.halbornmainframe.com/import_a_wallet_with_secret_eace14debc_ae2d753053.png)

When these conditions are met, the mnemonic key will be accessible:

* Without the user unlocking their wallet
* After a system restart
* After uninstalling the crypto wallet browser extension
* After deleting and reinstalling the browser

### User Mitigation

Users who believe they may be affected should migrate to a new set of accounts using the [instructions provided by MetaMask here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4867408571803). Rotating keys as a routine security measure and the use of a hardware wallet in conjunction with the browser based wallet can also provide increased security for users’ assets.

### Wallet User FAQ

Q: What versions of MetaMask are vulnerable?

A: Users who entered their seed phrase in Metamask 10.11.2 and earlier may be at risk.

Q: How do I know if my secret recovery phrase is secure?

A: The best way to know for sure is to generate a new secret recovery phrase and migrate your wallet using the [guidance provided by MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4867408571803). If disk encryption is in use then the seed phrase on-disk vulnerability is already mitigated.

Q: If I’m using a cold/hardware wallet am I affected?

A: No, we recommend always using a cold wallet or hardware wallet as outlined in our [post from November 2021](https://halborn.com/hot-wallets-vs-cold-wallets-whats-the-difference/).

Note: It is still imperative to be diligent about the transactions you approve to avoid scams like [malicious airdrops](https://halborn.com/the-new-claim-airdrop-trend-is-it-safe/) and [rug-pulls](https://halborn.com/7-warning-signs-of-a-cryptocurrency-exit-scam/)

Q: What if the device holding my browser wallet was stolen?

A: If the device was encrypted the secret recovery phrase should still be secure, however we recommend following the migration guidance provided above to assure the highest degree of protection.

## For Browser Wallet Providers

### Reproduction Steps:

* Generate a unique secret recovery phrase
* Import the secret recovery phrase
* Wait at least 30 seconds to ensure the browser has time to record the session to disk
* Close the browser

The secret recovery phrase can then be found in the browser session data

### Mitigation Suggestions:

The following are suggested mitigation measures that can be taken by wallet providers to avoid secret recovery phrases being stored in plain text both on-disk, and in system memory

* Split the Mnemonic Phrase input field into several fields (one per word) and ensure that only one is revealed at a time
* Instead of having the user enter their whole Phrase, use word selection for Mnemonic Phrase confirmation on wallet creation
* To speed up the garbage collector’s removal of the phrase from memory, clear or dereference values of variables which store Mnemonic Phrases in your code
* Avoid displaying the Mnemonic Phrase raw in the browser.

  + A way to do this is to display the Mnemonic in an HTML5 canvas, so that the browser does not load the whole Phrase in memory.
  + Another way is to obfuscate the Mnemonic Phrase as you display it. Each Mnemonic word could be displayed in a span HTML tag. In-between these spans there should be additional “fake” spans with “fake” random words. Each of the “fake” spans should have the following CSS properties: .fake{ position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; z-index: -1; opacity: 0; } . This forces the browser to only display “genuine” Mnemonic words, while loading both the “genuine” and “fake” words into memory – thus obfuscating the Mnemonic Phrase.
* Prevent (and warn) users from directly copying/pasting the Mnemonic Phrase into the browser. The browser’s clipboard is also responsible for leaking data into memory. Therefore, it is important to warn the user not to fill the browser’s clipboard with the Mnemonic Phrase, and to prevent them from doing so using the following method:

  + Use the e.preventDefault() method on the onPaste event handler.
  + It is also important to warn the user to manually enter their Mnemonic Phrase word-by-word. Even by using the e.preventDefault() method, the user is still able to copy/paste their Mnemonic. The only difference when using the aforementioned method is that it will live in memory for a shorter period of time. It is better not to introduce it into memory at all.
  + During recovery of a wallet by entering the Mnemonic Phrase, it is suggested, instead of a text area, to provide to the users one password input for each mnemonic word.

# Halborn Discovers Critical Vulnerability Affecting Crypto Wallet Browser Extensions

---

[![profile](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.halbornmainframe.com%2FH_5142506d44.png&w=256&q=75)](/blog/author/halborn)[Halborn](/blog/author/halborn)

June 15th, 2022

---

The Security Research Team at Halborn has discovered a critical vulnerability affecting many major cryptocurrency wallets. Wallets that were affected include MetaMask, Brave, Phantom, and xDefi, who have remediated the issue.

Under the right conditions, the vulnerability – which we code-named “**Demonic**” – can expose a crypto wallet user’s secret recovery phrase which can in turn be used to reconstruct their private key, allowing attackers to access billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies and NFTs held in browser extension wallets.

You can view the full technical details and remediation recommendations on the [Demonic Vulnerability announcement page](https://halborn.com/disclosures/demonic-vulnerability). Refer to the [MetaMask Blog Post](https://medium.com/%40danfinlay/d437d4250863) and [Phantom Blog Post](https://phantom.app/blog/demonic-vulnerability) for more useful information from their teams.

Due to the severity of the vulnerability and the number of impacted users, technical details were kept confidential until a good faith effort could be made to contact affected wallet providers.

Now that the wallet providers have had the opportunity to remediate the issue and migrate their users to secure recovery phrases, Halborn is providing in-depth details to raise awareness of the vulnerability and help prevent similar ones in the future.

## How does it work?

Browser extension cryptocurrency wallets that use an input field for a [BIP39 mnemonic](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase) can cause the secret recovery phrase to be stored on-disk in plain text where an attacker that has physical or logical access to the device can retrieve it and gain access to the wallet.

## Who is affected? What should they do?

**Users:** Userswho have imported their browser based crypto wallet using a secret recovery phrase may be impacted.

The risk is present if all of the following conditions were met:

* The hard drive was unencrypted
* The Secret Recovery Phrase was imported into a browser extension wallet using a device that is no longer in the user’s possession or is logically compromised
* The user used the “Show Secret Recovery Phrase” checkbox to view the seed phrase on-screen during import

It is recommended that users who believe they may be affected migrate to a new set of accounts. MetaMask has prepared [instructions on how to migrate](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4867408571803) for their users.

Rotating passwords/keys and the use of a hardware wallet in conjunction with the browser based wallet can also provide increased security for users. Enabling local disk encryption is another best practice which mitigates this issue.

Desktop application cryptocurrency wallets and web based wallets may be prone to similar issues but due to the disparity of offerings we have not investigated that in depth.

**Wallet Providers:** Wallet Providers who believe they may still be susceptible to the vulnerability are strongly encouraged to follow the mitigation suggestions outlined on the Demonic Vulnerability Disclosure page.

    …

   ```
   This is a pure refactor that extracts the SRP input from the
   `CreateNewVault` component. This is intended to make future changes to
   the SRP input easier, and to reduce duplication between the old and new
   onboarding flows.

   Extensive unit tests have been added for the new SRP input component.

   A new test library was added (`@testing-library/user-event`) for
   simulating user events with components rendered using the
   `@testing-library` library.

   A new helper method has been added (`renderWithLocalization`) for
   rendering components using `@testing-library` with just our
   localization contexts added as a wrapper. The localization contexts
   were already added by the `renderWithProviders` helper function, but
   there is no need for a Redux provider in these unit tests.

[Improve unit tests for](/MetaMask/metamask-extension/commit/1eecc59969705d16ef5a94258359e1bb32cee3d5) `[SrpInput](/MetaMask/metamask-extension/commit/1eecc59969705d16ef5a94258359e1bb32cee3d5)` [component (](/MetaMask/metamask-extension/commit/1eecc59969705d16ef5a94258359e1bb32cee3d5)[#13803](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/13803)[)](/MetaMask/metamask-extension/commit/1eecc59969705d16ef5a94258359e1bb32cee3d5)
    …

   ```
   The library `@testing-library/user-event` has been updated to the
   latest beta version, so that our unit tests better model real user
   interactions. In particular, I found that previously the `paste` event
   was missing the `clipboardData` API, so it was impossible to implement
   any custom handling of paste events (which we will need in later PRs).

   See the `v14.0.0-beta.1` release notes for a list of all breaking
   changes [1]. The main change is that all methods now return Promises.
   The `paste` method has also been dramatically simplified.

   The unit tests have also been updated to reset all mocks before each
   test. These tests don't have any shared mocks, but this is generally a
   good practice, to ensure that tests don't develop accidental inter-
   dependencies.

   ```
   The `data-test-id` prop has been added to `TextField`. This prop allows
   selecting this component more easily from e2e and unit tests. This is
   required for a subsequent PR that includes a text field that cannot be
   selected for by placeholder or contents or label (any of which would
   have been preferable).

   Add two new FontAwesome icon components. The first is an eye, and the
   second is an eye with a slash through it. These will be used in a
   subsequent PR for a "Show/Hide" toggle.

   A new method has been added to the e2e webdriver for pasting text into
   a field. This will be required to properly test a change to the SRP
   input, which will be coming in a separate PR.

   A few existing e2e tests have been updated to use this method to input
   the SRP, to show that it works properly.

   ```
   Add a new component for controlling whether a field should be shown
   or hidden. This will be used in later PRs as a control for sensitive
   fields that are hidden by default.

   This component should be fully accessible. Both mouse and keyboard
   interactions have been tested, and `aria-label` attributes have been
   added to explain the two "eye" icons that don't have any corresponding
   text.

   Thorough unit tests have been written, testing all props except
   `className` (I don't know how to test that using Jest/`jsdom`).

    …

   ```
   * Initial implementation of new SrpInput component

   This new version of the SrpInput component uses a separate field for
   each word of the SRP. Only one field can be revealed at a time, making
   it less likely that it gets accidentally revealed to somebody.

   * Fix copy mistakes

   * Move container div from 'create vault' to 'srp-input', and setup grid layout

   * Increase size of title

   * Remove hard-coded width in Storybook to allow testing different viewport sizes

   * Improve layout

   * Improve margins

   * Update dropdown text

   * Expand SRP input section

   * Remove unused localized messages

   * Update dropdown option names in unit tests

   * Replace checkbox with show/hide toggle

   * Remove unused localized message

   * Fix 'data-testid' prop name

   * Fix e2e test imports using paste

   * Use 'ActionableMessage' component for error message

   * Convert error popover to actionable message

   * Add tip about pasting the SRP

   * Remove invalid prop

   The "info" style of `ActionableMessage` is the default, so no type is
   required.

   * Use more readable test convenience methods

   The method `toBeInTheDocument()` is now used over `not.toBeNull()` to
   improve the readability of tests. Likewise, the convenience method
   `.clear` is now used to clear fields rather than manually entering the
   key combination to clear a field.

   * Fix misspelled word

1. [Fix SrpInput small viewport styles (](/MetaMask/metamask-extension/commit/49e65a706131462ade344ee3730c45aa1bed351e)[#14087](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/14087)[)](/MetaMask/metamask-extension/commit/49e65a706131462ade344ee3730c45aa1bed351e)
    …

   ```
   The styles for smaller viewports were broken because I forgot to update
   the small-screen grid template after adding the "paste-tip". The styles
   have now been updated to fit the content properly on all of our
   supported screen sizes.
