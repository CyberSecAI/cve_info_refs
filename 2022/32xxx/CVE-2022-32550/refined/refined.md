- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A deviation from the standard Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol in 1Password's implementation of network connections. This deviation weakened a security layer, allowing a malicious server to impersonate the 1Password service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper implementation of SRP. Specifically, a "historical deviation" from the standard protocol, which weakened network connection setup.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A person-in-the-middle attacker, on a compromised network, can manipulate the 1Password app or integration to connect to their malicious server instead of the legitimate 1Password service. This allows the attacker to inspect the contents of encrypted requests sent by the 1Password app, potentially revealing email addresses of family or team members, billing information, security settings, and other account-related data.
- **Attack vectors:** A compromised network connection where an attacker can read and manipulate network requests. The attacker also needs a certificate trusted by the device to authenticate with a fake server, to pose as `1password.com` and to create a malicious server that behaves identically to a 1Password server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have control over the network connection, be able to perform a person-in-the-middle attack, and must have the ability to set up a server that emulates the 1Password service including having a trusted certificate.
