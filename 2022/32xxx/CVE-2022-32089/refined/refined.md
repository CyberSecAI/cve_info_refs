Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `st_select_lex_unit::exclude_level` function in MariaDB. This function appears to be involved in processing subqueries.
*   The provided PoC query `KILL STRCMP ( 'x' = 47051287.000000 , TIME ( NOT 'x' IN ( SELECT -32768 ) ) MOD 44 ) ;` triggers a crash, indicating a flaw in how this function handles certain types of nested subqueries with specific operations like `STRCMP`, `TIME`, and `MOD`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Crash Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is a crash caused by a signal 11 (segmentation fault), due to a bug in the `st_select_lex_unit::exclude_level` function when handling specific SQL constructs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a denial of service. The MariaDB server process crashes, making the database unavailable. This affects database services using vulnerable versions of MariaDB.
*   **Potential Data Integrity Issues**: While not explicitly stated, a server crash may result in transactional inconsistencies or data loss if not handled properly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SQL Query:** The attack vector is a specially crafted SQL query. The provided PoC demonstrates a query that can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send SQL queries:** An attacker needs to be able to send queries to the MariaDB server. This could be achieved via:
    *   Compromised user with database access
    *   SQL injection vulnerability in an application
    *   Direct access to the server if exposed

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects MariaDB versions 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7.
*   Fixes were released in versions 10.4.26, 10.5.17, 10.6.9, 10.7.5, and 10.8.4.
*   The vulnerability is related to how the server processes nested subqueries with string comparisons, time functions, and modulo operations.
