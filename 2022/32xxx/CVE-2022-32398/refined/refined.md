Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-32398
*   **Affected Software:** Prison Management System 1.0
*   **Vendor:** sourcecodester.com
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Location:** The vulnerability is located in `/pms/admin/cells/manage_cell.php` at line 4. The vulnerable code is:
    ```php
    $qry = $conn->query("SELECT c.*, p.name as `prison` from `cell_list` c inner join prison_list p on c.prison_id = p.id where c.id = '{$_GET['id']}' and c.`delete_flag` = 0 ");
    ```

**Root Cause:**

*   The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `$_GET['id']` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization of the `$_GET['id']` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data including inmate records, personal information, etc.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modification of prison data like cell assignments, inmate details, and other critical records.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Potential to bypass authentication and gain administrative access by manipulating login credentials or user data.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Potential to perform queries that could degrade or stop the service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/pms/admin/cells/manage_cell.php` endpoint by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This typically requires network access to the server hosting the application.
*   No authentication is explicitly mentioned to be required to exploit this specific vulnerability, suggesting that an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

*   The provided PoC uses an error-based SQL injection to demonstrate the vulnerability.
    *   **Payload:**  `http://localhost/pms/admin/cells/manage_cell.php?id=1'-(if(database()='pms_db',0,1))%23`
    *   This payload uses an `if` condition to determine whether the current database is 'pms_db' and demonstrates the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability based on the output.
