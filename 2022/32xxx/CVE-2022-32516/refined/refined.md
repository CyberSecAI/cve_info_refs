- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Conext™ ComBox product suffers from a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to a lack of proper protection against POST-based CSRF attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CWE-352). The product does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to trick the user's browser into sending malicious requests to the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can override system configurations, potentially causing a reboot loop.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can craft a malicious web page or email containing a forged request that the user's browser will send to the vulnerable device when the user interacts with it while being logged into the Combox.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to trick a user into visiting a malicious webpage or interacting with a malicious email. The user must also be logged into the Conext™ Combox web interface at the time of interaction for the attack to succeed.
