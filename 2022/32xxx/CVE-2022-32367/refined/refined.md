The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Product Show Room Site v1.0" application by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `/psrs/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses user-supplied input within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Unauthorized access and retrieval of sensitive information from the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of data stored in the database.
    - Potential for privilege escalation if the database user has elevated permissions.
    - Full compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed via HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/psrs/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry&id=`.
- The `id` parameter is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication to the application is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical details:**
- The provided example demonstrates the use of a time-based SQL injection technique, using the `length(database())` function to determine the database name length.
- The attacker uses boolean-based SQL injection. The length of the response indicates whether the length of the database name matches the number tested by the attacker.
- The vulnerable file is `/psrs/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry&id=`.
- The default admin credentials are provided (admin/admin123).
