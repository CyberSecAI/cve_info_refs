Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-32399

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure use of user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) directly within an SQL query in the `view_crime.php` file. The application fails to sanitize or parameterize the input, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the direct inclusion of unsanitized user input into an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   They could read sensitive information (e.g., inmate details, user information).
*   An attacker might be able to modify or delete data.
*   In severe cases, full control over the database and potentially the server is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP GET request parameter named `id` in `/pms/admin/crimes/view_crime.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
*   No authentication is mentioned as a requirement, but the attacker does need to know the vulnerable URL path.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `/pms/admin/crimes/view_crime.php` at line 4:
```php
$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * from `crime_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}' and delete_flag = 0 ");
```
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability using error-based SQL injection:
```
http://localhost/pms/admin/crimes/view_crime.php?id=1'-if(database()='pms_db',0,1)%23
```

This payload checks if the database name is 'pms\_db', if it is, it returns no error. Otherwise, it will return an error. This is how the attacker can test if the SQL injection works and then utilize the vulnerability further.
