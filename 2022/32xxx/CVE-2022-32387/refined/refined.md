      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The description field for a custom table wasn't properly sanitized, allowing a malicious user to insert HTML/JavaScript code which would then be executed when the custom table configuration or data was viewed.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser by injecting HTML/JavaScript code into the description field of a custom table. This could lead to various security risks such as session hijacking or the theft of sensitive information.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects the malicious code via the custom table description field in the admin panel.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit custom tables within the Kentico CMS. This typically requires administrative access or at least permissions to modify custom table configurations. There is no mention of the need for user interaction to trigger the XSS, therefore, it would be triggered automatically when a privileged user views the malicious content."
