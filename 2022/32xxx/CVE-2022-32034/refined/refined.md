```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Stack overflow in the `formdelMasteraclist` function due to insufficient length checking when using `sscanf` to split a string into a buffer.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack overflow vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of Service (DoS).
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/delAcListInfo` URL with a long `items` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected device, likely requiring network access to the device.
