Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `delete_category` function within the `/psrs/classes/Master.php` file. The application does not properly sanitize user input provided through the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-supplied input (`id` parameter) is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Leakage:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database by crafting malicious queries. In this specific case, the attacker is able to retrieve the database name using `updatexml` function.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The vulnerability allows attackers to potentially perform more advanced database attacks, such as data modification or deletion, depending on the database permissions of the application's database user.
- **Application Takeover**: While not explicitly shown in the provided content, SQL injection can lead to privilege escalation and full application takeover in some cases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/psrs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_category` endpoint.
- **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is inserted into the `id` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques and how to craft malicious SQL queries.
- **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerable endpoint and parameter.

**Technical Details from the content:**
- The content includes a sample POST request that demonstrates the SQL injection attack. The payload used is `' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+` which leverages the `updatexml` function to extract the database name.
- The database name is identified as `psrs_db` with length of 7,
-  The default admin login credentials are also given as admin/admin123
