Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-32115:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2022-32115 - Idno Known version <= 1.3.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary Javascript execution due to improper SVG validation.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of SVG files uploaded to the platform. The application checks if a file has an SVG extension but doesn't sanitize the file's content, allowing malicious SVG files containing JavaScript to be uploaded.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Inadequate SVG Validation:** The `isSVG` function only checks the file extension and does not parse or sanitize the SVG content.
    *   **Bypass of Script Tag Filter:** While a script tag filter is implemented by the `isFileFreeFromScriptTags` function, an attacker can bypass this using other methods to inject JavaScript into the SVG file (e.g., by using SVG elements like `<script>` with CDATA or event handlers).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript. When the victim views or interacts with the uploaded SVG file, the embedded JavaScript code is executed within their browser context. This can lead to:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker can inject malicious scripts that can steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** This can lead to a variety of malicious actions within the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file through a file upload functionality of the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the Known platform to utilize the file upload feature.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post highlights the developers' awareness of the need for better SVG validation through a `// TODO` comment in the code, emphasizing the oversight.
*   The blog post also mentions that the `isFileFreeFromScriptTags` function was added to address embedded code issues but was easily bypassed by the vulnerability.
*   The blog post suggests several remediations, including completely disabling SVG support or using a third-party library to handle SVG sanitization and validation.
