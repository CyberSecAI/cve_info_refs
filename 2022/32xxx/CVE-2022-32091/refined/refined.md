Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-32091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **use-after-poison** issue. This means that the program is attempting to access memory that has already been freed or deallocated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Poison:** The core issue is that a memory region is freed, and then later accessed and written to. The specific location is `0x6290000a6080`.
*   The vulnerability occurs in the `JOIN::make_aggr_tables_info()` function during query optimization
*   The ASAN report indicates that `memset` is writing to this poisoned address.
*   The affected code is related to join optimization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash of the MariaDB server. The AddressSanitizer (ASan) report shows that the program aborts due to the use-after-poison error.
*   **Potential for further issues:** Although not explicitly stated, use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more severe exploits like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted SQL queries that trigger the vulnerable code path during query optimization.
*   The specific SQL steps to reproduce are provided and involve creating a table, followed by a series of `SELECT`, `UPDATE` and `INSERT` queries that trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send SQL queries to the MariaDB server. This typically requires a user with a database connection or a way to inject SQL commands into the server.
*   No specific privileges are needed for the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   MariaDB versions prior to 10.4.26, 10.5.17, 10.6.9, and 10.7.5 are vulnerable.
    *   The Jira ticket specifically mentions version 10.7.0 as affected
*   **Fix Versions:**
    *   The vulnerability is fixed in MariaDB versions 10.3.36, 10.4.26, 10.5.17, 10.6.9, 10.7.5, and 10.8.4.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "Major" in the Jira ticket and has a CVSS score of 9.8 (CRITICAL) according to NetApp.
*   The issue is a duplicate of MDEV-23809.

**Summary of provided documents:**

*   The **Jira ticket** provides the most detailed technical information, including the steps to reproduce and the ASan crash report.
*   The **Fedora mailing lists** confirm that the vulnerability is addressed in updates for Fedora 35, 36, and 37.
*   The **NetApp advisory** identifies that StorageGRID incorporates MariaDB, and it is vulnerable to CVE-2022-32091 among others. It also indicates the high CVSS score for this vulnerability and its impact.
*   The **Debian mailing list** mentions that mariadb-10.3 is affected by this vulnerability and is fixed in 10.3.36-0+deb10u1.

**In conclusion, CVE-2022-32091 is a critical use-after-poison vulnerability in MariaDB triggered by specific crafted SQL queries during the query optimization phase, leading to a server crash and potential for further issues. Patches are available in the versions mentioned above.**
