{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A malicious package named 'request' (without the 's') was added to the dependencies of the 'django-navbar-client' package on PyPI, likely due to a typo during the migration from urllib3 to the popular 'requests' library. The malicious package is a backdoor.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a malicious dependency with a similar name to a legitimate one (typosquatting).",
      "Inclusion of the malicious package in the `install_requires` section of the package's setup."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. The malicious 'request' package allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems where the vulnerable 'django-navbar-client' package is installed.",
    "attack_vectors": "Typosquatting. Attackers published a malicious package on PyPI with a name similar to a legitimate one, in this case `requests` vs `request`, and then the malicious package was included as a dependency of another package.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to publish a package on PyPI that has a similar name to an existing popular package. Then the attacker relies on a user or developer mistyping the package name or making a mistake in configuration by depending on the malicious package. Users who installed vulnerable versions of 'django-navbar-client' with the malicious 'request' dependency are vulnerable. The attacker can execute arbitrary code on those systems if the malicious package is installed."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The maintainer of the 'django-navbar-client' project removed the affected packages from PyPI and updated the repository to prevent accidental installations of the malicious version."
