```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `url_get_contents` function in `objects/aVideoEncoderReceiveImage.json.php` uses `file_get_contents` to retrieve content from a user-controlled URL. This allows an attacker to specify a local file path instead of a URL, leading to arbitrary file reads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file read, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information such as database credentials. This could allow privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP request to `/objects/aVideoEncoderReceiveImage.json.php` with the `downloadURL_image` parameter set to a local file path.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the permission to upload videos on the AVideo platform to exploit this vulnerability."
