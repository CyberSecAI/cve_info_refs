Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `manage_room.php` script. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the URL is directly used in an SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterized queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists due to unsanitized input being used in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
- The provided example shows the ability to extract the current database name ( `hprms_db`) which is a piece of reconnaissance information an attacker could use.
- More severe impact includes data breaches, data modification, and potentially gaining complete control of the underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/hprms/admin/rooms/manage_room.php` endpoint with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication to exploit the SQLi is mentioned.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques (union based).

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable File: `/hprms/admin/rooms/manage_room.php`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `id`
- Example Payload: `/hprms/admin/rooms/manage_room.php?id=-1' union select 1,2,database(),4,5,6,7,8--+`
- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject data into the query's result set.

This analysis provides specific details of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable file, parameter, and how the attack works using a crafted payload, which goes beyond the generic description typically found in CVE entries.
