      "root_cause": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can lead to unintended actions within the plugin.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful CSRF attack could enable a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications of the plugin's settings or other administrative tasks.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into executing a crafted malicious request. This could be achieved through social engineering tactics, such as embedding a malicious link in a forum or email.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or triggering a crafted request. The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress admin panel."
