Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32192:

**CVE-2022-32192**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `couchbase-cli` tool was leaking the Secrets Management master password as a command-line argument.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (master password) through command-line arguments.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the command-line arguments (e.g., through process listing or logs) could obtain the Secrets Management master password. This could allow them to potentially decrypt secrets and gain unauthorized access to the system or sensitive data.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system where `couchbase-cli` was executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker needs to have access to command-line arguments, potentially via process inspection, process logs, or other means.
