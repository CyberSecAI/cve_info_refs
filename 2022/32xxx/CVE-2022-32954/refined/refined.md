Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-32954:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- DMA (Direct Memory Access) attacks on the `SdMmcDevice` shared buffer used by both System Management Mode (SMM) and non-SMM code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition: Because the buffer is shared between SMM and non-SMM, an attacker could potentially modify the contents after SMM has checked it, but before SMM uses it.
- Shared memory buffer between SMM and non-SMM is vulnerable to DMA attacks.
- Improper synchronization of shared resource usage between different privilege levels (SMM and non-SMM).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Corruption of System Management RAM (SMRAM).
- Escalation of privileges to SMM.

**Attack vectors:**
- DMA attacks: An attacker with the ability to perform DMA attacks can modify the shared buffer, causing a race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access with the ability to perform DMA attacks.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the system in a way that allows for the exploitation of the TOCTOU vulnerability.
