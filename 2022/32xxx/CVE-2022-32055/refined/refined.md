Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `guests` parameter of the Inout Homestay application, version 2.2, which leads to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Time-based Blind SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection. This means that an attacker can infer the results of their SQL queries based on the time it takes for the application to respond, even if no data is directly returned.
- The `guests` POST parameter is vulnerable.
- Specifically the vulnerability is in `index.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database.
- Remote Code Execution: Although not explicitly stated in this document, SQL injection can potentially lead to remote code execution if the database user has sufficient permissions.
- The ability to bypass authentication is mentioned.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/index.php?page=search/rentals` endpoint.
- Malicious Input: The attack vector is located in the `guests` parameter within the POST request, injecting malicious SQL code as a string literal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote non-authenticated attacker: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to craft SQL injection payloads: The attacker must be able to construct SQL injection queries.
