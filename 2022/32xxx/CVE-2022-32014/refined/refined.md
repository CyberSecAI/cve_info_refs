The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Complete Online Job Search System v1.0".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user input in the `SEARCH` parameter within the `/eris/index.php` file. Specifically, when the `q` parameter is set to `result` and `searchfor` is set to `byfunction`, the `SEARCH` parameter's value is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `SEARCH` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authentication, extract sensitive information from the database (such as database name and potentially other data), modify database content, or potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious SQL code into the `SEARCH` parameter.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to `/eris/index.php?q=result&searchfor=byfunction`.
- The malicious SQL payload is injected into the `SEARCH` parameter via the POST request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoint.
- No prior authentication is needed to exploit this specific vulnerability.
