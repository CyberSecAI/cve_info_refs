{
  "CVE-2022-32205": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A malicious server can send an excessive amount of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response, causing curl to store them all. This leads to subsequent HTTP requests including these cookies, potentially exceeding curl's internal size limit and resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Unbounded resource allocation and lack of input validation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service, preventing curl from making further HTTP requests due to the excessive size of the cookie headers. This state can persist as long as the cookies remain stored and match the targeted servers.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious server sends a large number of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a server that curl will interact with, and send an HTTP response containing many cookie headers."
