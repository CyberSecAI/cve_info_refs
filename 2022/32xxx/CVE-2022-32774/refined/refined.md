**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition within the JavaScript engine of Foxit PDF Reader. This occurs when the `deletePages()` function is called, which prematurely deletes objects associated with pages, leading to a situation where the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. By controlling the freed memory via Javascript, the attacker can potentially overwrite crucial data, hijack control flow and execute malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted malicious PDF document.
- Visiting a specially crafted malicious website with the browser plugin extension enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious website with the browser plugin enabled.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file containing the specific Javascript code to trigger the vulnerability, including the ability to influence memory layout after the `deletePages()` call.
