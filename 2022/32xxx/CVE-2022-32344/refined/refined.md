The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Hospital's Patient Records Management System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when processing a request to the `/hprms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_patient` endpoint, which allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (e.g. leaking the database name)
    - Data modification or deletion
    - Full database takeover

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to the `/hprms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_patient` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They do not need to be authenticated.
