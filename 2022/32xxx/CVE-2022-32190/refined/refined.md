    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability in `net/url` package's `JoinPath` and `URL.JoinPath` functions allows relative path components like `../` to remain in the resulting URL under specific conditions, leading to potential directory traversal attacks.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `JoinPath` and `URL.JoinPath` functions in the `net/url` package do not consistently remove relative path components (`../`) when appending to a URL, particularly when the base URL does not end with a `/`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inconsistent path sanitization: The functions behave differently depending on whether the base URL ends with a forward slash, leading to unexpected results.",
        "Path traversal: The failure to properly strip relative path components allows for potential directory traversal attacks when processing user-supplied or external URL components."
      ],
      "impact": "A directory traversal vulnerability can be exploited through the `net/url` package, potentially allowing attackers to access resources outside of the intended path or context by crafting URLs with relative path components.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating the second argument of the `JoinPath` or `URL.JoinPath` functions to include `../` sequences.",
        "Supplying crafted relative path components that exploit the inconsistency in `JoinPath`'s behavior based on the presence or absence of a trailing slash in the base URL."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to control or influence the input passed as the second argument to `JoinPath` or `URL.JoinPath` functions.",
        "The attacker needs to find a context where the output of the vulnerable function is used without further sanitization, particularly for accessing file systems or other resources based on path traversal."
      ],
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in Go versions prior to 1.19.1, and the fix is included in version 1.19.1 and later. The issue was reported by @q0jt. The official CVE description was updated to provide more details about the vulnerability and its potential impact."
