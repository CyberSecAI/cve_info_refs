### **[1ue0v](/1ue0v)** commented [Jun 4, 2022](#issue-1260561602) • edited Loading

| XSS vulnerability in u5cms version 8.3.5  Cross-site Scripting (XSS) refers to client-side code injection attack wherein an attacker can execute malicious scripts into a legitimate website or web application. XSS occurs when a web application makes use of unvalidated or unencoded user input within the output it generates.  When I access the default home page on the web, if the parameter passed in is `/? "Onmouseover=%27tzgl (96502)%27bad="`, it can be found that the passed in parameters appear in the href attribute of a tag in the page.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54606628/171971895-915c68d4-7d67-45b7-9e33-e8d1d336b431.png)  Then view the source code,you can find the entered parameters and their existence in the href attribute of the a tag  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54606628/171971867-7432600a-b213-4613-aaa0-d5efadd29242.png)  If the parameter passed in is a payload carefully constructed by the attacker, it may cause more serious HTML injection. And if possible, I strongly suggest you check more carefully whether the parameters entered by the user are legal when handling user input and output in the program.  Best wishes! |
