- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly validate or encode user-supplied input passed through a URL parameter, which is then reflected in the HTML output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to various impacts, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the query parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and distribute a malicious URL to a victim. The attacker does not require any special access to the webserver or application.
