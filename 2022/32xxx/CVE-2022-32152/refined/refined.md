{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform, by default, did not validate TLS certificates during Splunk-to-Splunk communications.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle attack by positioning a malicious machine between two Splunk platform instances. This would allow the attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate communications without either instance being aware.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attack",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be positioned on the network path between two Splunk instances to intercept and redirect communications."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    {
      "name": "Splunk Enterprise",
      "versions": "Versions before 9.0",
      "fix_versions": "9.0.0"
    },
    {
      "name": "Splunk Cloud Platform",
      "versions": "Versions before 8.2.2203",
      "fix_versions": "8.2.2203"
    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability assumes that you have configured your Splunk platform instances to use transport layer security (TLS) certificates for secure network connections. If you have not and are using the default certificates, the vulnerability is not applicable and is informational."
