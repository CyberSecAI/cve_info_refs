- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a double-free error in the `web_ipcam_set_param_post` function of the Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit. The function allocates a buffer on the heap, copies the content of the HTTP request to it and then frees the allocated memory. Subsequently, it calls a destructor (`std::vector<int>::~vector`) on the same buffer, which attempts to free the same memory again, leading to a double-free.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double-free vulnerability (CWE-415)

- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS). The double free causes the `hpgw` binary to crash and the device to reboot via watchdog reset. While there is a small possibility of achieving code execution, this was not demonstrated, and the device crashes gracefully.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted, authenticated HTTP POST request to the `/action/ipcamSetParamPost` endpoint of the device's web interface.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device's web interface to exploit the vulnerability.
    - The web interface needs to be enabled, which is disabled by default. However, other vulnerabilities (TALOS-2022-1552 or TALOS-2022-1553) could allow a remote attacker to enable the web server.
