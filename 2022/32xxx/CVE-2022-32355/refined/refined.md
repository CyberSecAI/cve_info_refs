The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Product Show Room Site v1.0" application by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `/psrs/admin/?page=products/view_product` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper input validation/sanitization on the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive database information.
- An attacker can potentially modify or delete data.
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the application or underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/psrs/admin/?page=products/view_product` with a malicious SQL payload within the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL, parameter, and basic SQL syntax.
- The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
