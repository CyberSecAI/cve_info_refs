      "The Python 3 libraries used by Splunk did not validate TLS certificates by default",
      "Lack of TLS certificate hostname validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A machine-in-the-middle attack could be performed by a malicious actor by intercepting communications between Splunk instances.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network based attack by intercepting communications between Splunk platform instances"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to perform machine-in-the-middle attack on the network between Splunk components."
    ],
   "additional_info": "The vulnerability is rated as high severity (CVSSv3.1 score of 7.4). It is informational by default because it requires apps to be configured not to use TLS verification.
