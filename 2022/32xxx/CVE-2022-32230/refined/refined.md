    "CVE-2022-32230": {
        "description": "A remote and unauthenticated attacker can trigger a denial-of-service condition on Microsoft Windows Domain Controllers by leveraging a flaw that leads to a null pointer deference within the Windows kernel. The same vulnerability can be triggered on systems that are not Domain Controllers when authenticated. The vulnerability is triggered by opening a named pipe and then querying it for FileNormalizedNameInformation. Access to a named pipe is why domain controllers can exploited anonymously while other systems require authentication.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in `srv2!Smb2ValidateVolumeObjectsMatch` to verify that a pointer is not null before reading a `PDEVICE_OBJECT` from it and passing it to `IoGetBaseFileSystemDeviceObject`.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
            "Null pointer dereference"
        ],
        "impact": "Denial of service. The affected Windows system will crash, likely leading to a system restart.",
        "attack_vector": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit a domain controller by opening a named pipe and making a `QUERY_INFO` request for the `FILE_NORMALIZED_NAME_INFORMATION` class. Systems which aren't domain controllers require prior authentication, making named pipes other than `netlogon` potential attack vectors if such an authenticated connection is established first.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can send network traffic to the vulnerable server, and initiate an SMB connection."
