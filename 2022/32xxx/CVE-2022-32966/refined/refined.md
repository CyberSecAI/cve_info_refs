- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Realtek RTL8111FP-CG DASH remote management function lacks proper authorization management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization. An attacker on the local network can establish a TCP connection to the service port and cause a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service by occupying the service port.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker on the same local network can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device. No privileges are required.
