Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the `/pms/admin/cells/view_cell.php` file of the Prison Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses the value of the `$_GET['id']` parameter in an SQL query without any sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database, including prison information, inmate records, and potentially user credentials.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could potentially use SQL injection to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain administrative access to the application.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Malicious SQL queries could be crafted to disrupt normal application functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request where the attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Direct Injection:** The vulnerability occurs due to direct injection of unsanitized user input into the SQL query, specifically `$_GET['id']`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application, likely via HTTP or HTTPS.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter (`id` in `view_cell.php`) and how to manipulate SQL queries.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The provided exploit doesn't seem to require prior authentication as the vulnerable endpoint appears to be accessible to anyone.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is:

    ```php
    $qry = $conn->query("SELECT c.*, p.name as `prison` from `cell_list` c inner join prison_list p on c.prison_id = p.id where c.id = '{$_GET['id']}' and c.delete_flag = 0 ");
    ```

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates error-based SQL injection:

    ```
    http://localhost/pms/admin/cells/view_cell.php?id=1'-(if(database()='pms_db',0,1))%23
    ```

    This payload uses an `if` statement within the SQL query to conditionally cause a database error if the current database is `pms_db` (True), or if it's a different database (False). The screenshots in the github link demonstrate the different responses.

**Summary:**

The provided content clearly identifies a SQL injection vulnerability in the Prison Management System. The vulnerability is caused by the use of unsanitized user input in an SQL query.  An attacker with network access can exploit this by crafting malicious URLs and potentially gain access to sensitive data.
