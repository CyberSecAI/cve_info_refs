# ProxyAgent vulnerable to MITM

High

[mcollina](/mcollina)
published
GHSA-pgw7-wx7w-2w33
Jun 13, 2022

## Package

npm

undici
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= v4.8.2 <= 5.5.0

## Patched versions

>= v5.5.1

## Description

### Description

`Undici.ProxyAgent` never verifies the remote server's certificate, and always exposes all request & response data to the proxy. This unexpectedly means that proxies can MitM all HTTPS traffic, and if the proxy's URL is HTTP then it also means that nominally HTTPS requests are actually sent via plain-text HTTP between Undici and the proxy server.

### Impact

This affects all use of HTTPS via HTTP proxy using **`Undici.ProxyAgent`** with Undici or Node's global `fetch`. In this case, it removes all HTTPS security from all requests sent using Undici's `ProxyAgent`, allowing trivial MitM attacks by anybody on the network path between the client and the target server (local network users, your ISP, the proxy, the target server's ISP, etc).

This less seriously affects HTTPS via HTTPS proxies. When you send HTTPS via a proxy to a remote server, the proxy can freely view or modify all HTTPS traffic unexpectedly (but only the proxy).

Example:

```
setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent('http://localhost:8000/')) // HTTP Proxy
// or
undici.request('https://example.com/', { dispatcher: new ProxyAgent('http://localhost:8000') }) // HTTP Proxy
// or
fetch('https://example.com/', { dispatcher: new ProxyAgent('http://localhost:8000') }) // HTTP Proxy
```
### Patches

This issue was patched in Undici v5.5.1.

### Workarounds

At the time of writing, the only workaround is to not use `ProxyAgent` as a dispatcher for TLS Connections.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
