- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Undici.ProxyAgent` does not verify the remote server's certificate when using a proxy, exposing all request and response data to the proxy. Additionally, if the proxy's URL is HTTP, nominally HTTPS requests are sent via plain-text HTTP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability: When using an HTTP proxy, all HTTPS security is removed, allowing a MITM attack.
    -  Exposure of sensitive data: The proxy can view and modify all HTTPS traffic unexpectedly, even with HTTPS proxies.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Complete loss of HTTPS security when using HTTP proxies.
    -  Exposure of all request and response data to the proxy server.
    -  Potential for trivial MITM attacks by anyone on the network path between the client and the target server.
    -  Proxy can modify traffic even when using an HTTPS proxy.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, where an attacker has access to the network path between the client and the target server, including the proxy server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the target server, or control the proxy server itself. This can include local network users, the user's ISP, the proxy provider, the target server's ISP etc.
