- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from sending information over the network without using HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a lack of encryption when transmitting data, leaving the data susceptible to interception.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user in a privileged network position may intercept SSL/TLS connections.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a privileged network position, enabling the attacker to monitor network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to intercept the network traffic.
