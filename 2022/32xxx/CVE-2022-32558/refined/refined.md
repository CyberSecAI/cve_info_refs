{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Sample bucket loading process may leak internal user passwords when a failure occurs during the process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a result of insufficient error handling in the sample bucket loading process, leading to unintended exposure of sensitive data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with access to the leaked passwords could potentially gain unauthorized access to the system with the privileges of the leaked user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a failure during sample bucket loading, which could be caused by various issues during setup. An attacker might be able to induce this failure.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to have a position where they can view the server logs after a failure occurs during the sample bucket loading process."
