{
  "CVE-2022-32208": {
    "description": "When curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5, it handles message verification failures wrongly. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-In-The-Middle attack to go unnoticed and even allows it to inject data to the client.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of message verification failures during FTP transfers secured by krb5.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-924: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel"
    ],
    "impact": "A Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack can go unnoticed, and the attacker can inject data into the client's data stream.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack on FTP transfers secured with krb5"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be in a MITM position to intercept and modify the data stream, and the client needs to be using FTP with Kerberos (FTP-KRB)"
  }
