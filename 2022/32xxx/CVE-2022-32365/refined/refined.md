The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Product Show Room Site v1.0" application by oretnom23.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/psrs/admin/fields/manage_field.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability exists in the application's `manage_field.php` script.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. In the provided example, the attacker is able to determine the length of the database name. With further exploitation, the attacker could gain access to user credentials, modify or delete data, or perform other malicious actions depending on the database privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to the `/psrs/admin/fields/manage_field.php` endpoint, with a crafted SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the application and the ability to send HTTP requests. No specific user privileges beyond accessing the vulnerable page seem to be needed to exploit this SQLi vulnerability.

The provided content includes a detailed example with the following:
- The vulnerable file: `/psrs/admin/fields/manage_field.php?id=`
- The vulnerable parameter: `id`
- A successful proof of concept payload: `/psrs/admin/fields/manage_field.php?id=1%27%20and%20length(database())%20=7--+`
- Confirmation that the injection is successful by observing changes in the response `Content-Length` depending on whether the length check evaluates to true or false.
