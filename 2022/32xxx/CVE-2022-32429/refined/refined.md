{
  "Root cause": "A routing misconfiguration in the embedded \"goahead\" web browser, where a trailing forward slash is omitted when defining the route for the cgi-bin directory, while it is present when the path is defined for authentication purposes. This allows accessing the /cgi-bin/ directory without requiring authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Authentication Bypass due to routing misconfiguration in the web server",
    "Command Injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-specified fields in the /cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi script"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can remotely obtain device access credentials, credentials for other connected services (Google, dynamic DNS, email, Skype/SMS), control the device, and power cycle connected devices. With local subnet access, the attacker can gain full root shell access.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Remote access to the device's web interface via a specially crafted URL to bypass authentication.",
    "Local subnet access to exploit command injection vulnerability after obtaining credentials via the authentication bypass."
  ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Remote access to the device's web interface for the authentication bypass.",
    "Local subnet access to the device for command injection vulnerability."
  ]
