- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An information leak in the Point of Sale (POS) component of BTCPay Server. Sensitive information was exposed in the HTML source code of the publicly exposed POS app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information via HTML source code. Specifically, xpub (public key) and Lightning credentials were leaked when an external node was used. When an internal node was used, only xpub was leaked.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could obtain sensitive information including xpub and lightning network credentials which could lead to unauthorized access or financial loss.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by viewing the HTML source code of a publicly exposed POS app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the publicly exposed POS app and view its HTML source code.
