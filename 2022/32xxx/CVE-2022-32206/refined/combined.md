Debian Bug     : 989228 991492 1010295 1010254 1010253 1010252

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
denial of service attack.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
denial of service attack.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.64.0-4+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:

## CVE-2022-32206

# HTTP compression denial of service

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32206.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl supports "chained" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a
server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with
different algorithms. The number of acceptable "links" in this
"decompression chain" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to
insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps.

The use of such a decompression chain could result in a "malloc
bomb", making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap
memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.

## INFO

Automatic content decompression of content needs to be enabled per
transfer but the way Transfer-Encoding works in curl this code path and
problem can be reached with default options.

This flaw exists with just one of the compression algorithms built-in
(gzip, brotli or zstd), but the individual algorithms have different
"exploding" powers.

Both `Content-Encoding:` and
`Transfer-Encoding:` are affected. The vulnerability is more
emphasized over HTTP/1 than HTTP/2 due to different curl internal header
limits.

CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.57.0](vuln-7.57.0.html) to and including [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.57.0](vuln-7.57.0.html) and curl >= [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dbcced8e32b50c06>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The amount of accepted "chained" algorithms is now capped to 5.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3a09fbb7f264c67c43>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 15, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on June 20.

libcurl [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html) was released on June 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE SC-600 devices (SC622-2C, SC626-2C, SC632-2C, SC636-2C, SC642-2C, SC646-2C) are
used to protect trusted industrial networks from untrusted networks. They allow ﬁltering incoming and
outgoing network connections in different ways.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-32205

A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of “Set-Cookie:” headers in a HTTP response to curl
and curl < 7.84.0 stores all of them. A sufﬁciently large amount of (big) cookies make subsequent
HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests that become
larger than the threshold that curl uses internally to avoid sending crazy large requests (1048576
bytes) and instead returns an error.This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies
are kept, match and haven’t expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on “foo.example.com”
can set cookies that also would match for “bar.example.com”, making it it possible for a “sister server”
to effectively cause a denial of service for a sibling site on the same second level domain using this
method.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-32206

curl < 7.84.0 supports “chained” HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a serverresponse can
be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable
“links” in this “decompression chain” was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually
unlimited number of compression steps.The use of such a decompression chain could result in a
“malloc bomb”, makingcurl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying
toand returning out of memory errors.

 service

CVE-2023-23916: HTTP multi-header compression denial of service
===============================================================

Project curl Security Advisory, February 15th 2023 -
[Permalink](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-23916.html>)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

curl supports "chained" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server
response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different
algorithms. The number of acceptable "links" in this "decompression chain" was
capped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a malicious
server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by
using many headers.

The use of such a decompression chain could result in a "malloc bomb", making
curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to
and returning out of memory errors.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

CVE-2023-23916 was introduced in [commit
dbcced8e32b50c06](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dbcced8e32b50c06>),
shipped in curl 7.57.0.

Automatic decompression of content needs to be enabled per transfer. It is
disabled by default and then nothing bad happens.

This flaw exists with one or more of the compression algorithms built-in
(gzip, brotli or zstd), but the individual algorithms have different
"exploding" powers.

Both `Content-Encoding:` and `Transfer-Encoding:` are affected over all HTTP
versions.

This flaw is almost identical to the previous [CVE-2022-32206: HTTP
compression denial of service](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32206.html>), as
the fix for that earlier flaw was incomplete.

CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 7.57.0 to and including 7.87.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.57.0 and curl >= 7.87.0

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

THE SOLUTION
------------

The amount of accepted "chained" algorithms is now capped to 5 in total,
independently of the number of headers.

A [fix for CVE-2023-23916](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/119fb187192a9ea13dc>)

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

  A - Upgrade curl to version 7.88.0

  B - Apply the patch to your local version

  C - Do not enable automatic decompression

TIMELINE
--------

This issue was reported to the curl project on January 8, 2023. We contacted
distros@...nwall on February 7, 2023.

libcurl 7.88.0 was released on February 15 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-32207

# Non-preserved file permissions

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32207.html)

## VULNERABILITY

When curl saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local files, it
makes the operation atomic by finalizing the operation with a rename
from a temporary name to the final target filename.

In that rename operation, it might accidentally *widen* the
permissions for the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to
more users than intended.

## INFO

CVE-2022-32207 was introduced in [commit
b834890a3fa3f52](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b834890a3fa3f52), shipped in curl [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html).

This problem can be worked-around by using a strict umask.

CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html) to and including [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html) and curl >= [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b834890a3fa3f52>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/20f9dd6bae50b>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Make extra precautions to protect saved files (for example strict
umask)

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 17, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on June 20.

libcurl [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html) was released on June 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-32208

# FTP-KRB bad message verification

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32208.html)

## VULNERABILITY

When curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5, it handles message
verification failures wrongly. This flaw makes it possible for a
Man-In-The-Middle attack to go unnoticed and even allows it to inject
data to the client.

## INFO

CVE-2022-32208 was introduced in [commit
54967d2a3a](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/54967d2a3a), shipped in curl [7.16.4](vuln-7.16.4.html).

This flaw typically makes curl insert `599`  (+
terminating null) into the data where it detects the error, then the
attackers data. It forces the attacker to be somewhat creative to handle
this initial hard-coded 5 byte sequence of "junk".

FTP-KRB is a rarely used feature.

CWE-924: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During
Transmission in a Communication Channel

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.16.4](vuln-7.16.4.html) to and including [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.16.4](vuln-7.16.4.html) and curl >= [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/54967d2a3a>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/6ecdf5136b52af7>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use KRB-FTP

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on June 2, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on June 20.

libcurl [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html) was released on June 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-32205

# Set-Cookie denial of service

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32205.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of
`Set-Cookie:` headers in a HTTP response to curl and curl
stores all of them. A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make
subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies
match, create requests that become larger than the threshold that curl
uses internally to avoid sending crazy large requests (1048576 bytes)
and instead returns an error.

This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are
kept, match and have not expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server
on `foo.example.com` can set cookies that also would match
for `bar.example.com`, making it it possible for a "sister
server" to effectively cause a denial of service for a sibling site on
the same second level domain using this method.

## INFO

CVE-2022-32205 was introduced in [commit
ed35d6590e72c23c](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ed35d6590e72c23c), shipped in curl [7.71.0](vuln-7.71.0.html) with the introduction of
the "dynbuf" internally. Before this change, curl had no limit in how
large HTTP request it could generate.

CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.71.0](vuln-7.71.0.html) to and including [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.71.0](vuln-7.71.0.html) and curl >= [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ed35d6590e72c23c>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

We introduce several new limits and thresholds for cookies:

* Send no more than 150 cookies per request
* Cap the max length used for an outgoing `Cookie:`
  header to 8K
* Cap the max number of accepted `Set-Cookie:` header
  fields to 50
* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/48d7064a49148f0394>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use cookies

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 13, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on June 20.

libcurl [7.84.0](vuln-7.84.0.html) was released on June 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
