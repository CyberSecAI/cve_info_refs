{
  "CVE-2022-32206": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the unbounded number of acceptable \"links\" in a \"decompression chain\" of HTTP compression algorithms. A malicious server can insert many compression steps.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
    ],
    "Impact": "A \"malloc bomb\" occurs, causing curl to allocate excessive heap memory or fail with out-of-memory errors, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious server sends a specially crafted HTTP response with a long decompression chain using multiple compression algorithms.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the server sending the HTTP response. No special capabilities other than hosting the server are needed."
