- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unspecified parameters in the software are vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can perform unauthorized SQL queries and gain access to arbitrary files in the database.
- **Attack vectors**: Through vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable parameters.
