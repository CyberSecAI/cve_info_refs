Hash: SHA512
Advisory ID: SYSS-2022-039
Product: Jira Misc Custom Fields (JMCF)
Manufacturer: Appfire
Affected Version(s): 2.4.6
Tested Version(s): 2.4.6
Vulnerability Type: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Closed
Manufacturer Notification: 2022-05-27
Solution Date: 2022-06-29
Public Disclosure: 2022-07-07
CVE Reference: CVE-2022-32567
Author of Advisory: Lukas Faiß, SySS GmbH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
Jira Misc Custom Fields (JMCF) is an add-on for Jira to perform custom
calculations.
The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):
"JMCF by Appfire lets you easily expose 'hidden' issue information and
create calculations - from simple math operations to sophisticated
Groovy scripts."
Due to insufficient input validation of user-provided input, JMCF is
vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
The 'Add Auto Indexing Rule' function is prone to a stored XSS attack.
XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code
into server replies which is later executed in the browsers of other users.
By executing JavaScript, attackers can, for example, perform actions in
the context of other logged-in users.
For testing purposes, the add-on of the manufacturer[1] was used in
a local Jira Server[4] installation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
The combo box project selection within the 'Add Auto Indexing Rule'
function is vulnerable to an XSS attack.
If a project with the name "Pent![](x)" is created, it will be loaded via the following request when
loading the projects:
GET /rest/jmcf/1/project/picker?query=&maxResults=1000&showAvatar=true HTTP/2
Host: [REDACTED]
Cookie:
Sec-Ch-Ua: " Not A;Brand";v="99", "Chromium";v="101", "Google Chrome";v="101"
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, \*/\*; q=0.01
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0
User-Agent:
Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: "Linux"
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Referer: https://[REDACTED]/secure/JMCFEditIndexingRule!Default.jspa?id=
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
The response contains the project names. Within this page, the malicious
code is now being executed. Here is a line of the response that contains
the malicious stored project name:
,{
"name":"Pent![](x)Proj (PSOPPPP)",
"key":"PSOPPPP",
"html":"Pent![](x)Proj (PSOPPPP)"
},
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution:
Context-sensitive HTML encoding of project names.
