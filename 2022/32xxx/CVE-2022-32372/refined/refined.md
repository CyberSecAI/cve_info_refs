**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database, leading to:
    - Disclosure of sensitive information (e.g. database name).
    - Potential modification or deletion of data.
    - Possible complete compromise of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of the `/school/model/get_subject.php` file.
