The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Complete Online Job Search System v1.0" software.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `search` parameter of the `/eris/index.php` page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database, including the database name, and potentially other information. It may also lead to other attacks such as data modification, or complete control over the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to `/eris/index.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `search` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of SQL syntax. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
