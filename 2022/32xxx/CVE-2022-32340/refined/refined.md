The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Hospital's Patient Records Management System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/hprms/admin/?page=patients/view_patient` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including database names.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `/hprms/admin/?page=patients/view_patient` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement to exploit this vulnerability. However, the vulnerable page is located under `/hprms/admin/`, which might imply administrative access. The login credentials for the admin panel are provided as `admin/admin123`, but it is not clear if logging in is a prerequisite for exploitation.
