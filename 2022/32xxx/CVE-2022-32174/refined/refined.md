      "status": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the select assignee component of Gogs. When an administrator selects an assignee from the user list, a malicious JavaScript payload embedded in the user's first name is executed.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
          "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to account takeover. An attacker can gain admin privileges by executing malicious JavaScript.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "The attacker first injects malicious Javascript payload into a user's full name.",
           "The admin views the issue, which triggers the XSS when the user with the malicious payload is selected as assignee."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs a regular user account. They need to change their full name to include the XSS payload, and to host the javascript file that will give them admin access.  The attacker also needs the admin to select the user as an assignee on an issue. ",
        "additional_information": "The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how an attacker can achieve admin privileges by injecting a JavaScript payload into a user's full name, which then executes when an administrator attempts to assign an issue to that user. The vulnerability is in the way Gogs handles and renders user names in the assignee selection component."
