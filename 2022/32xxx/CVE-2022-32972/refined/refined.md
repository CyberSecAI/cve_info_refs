Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a DLL injection flaw in the Infoblox BloxOne Endpoint agent executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the BloxOne Endpoint agent executable is susceptible to DLL injection. This allows an attacker to load a malicious DLL into the process.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability leads to local privilege escalation, meaning a low-privileged user can elevate their privileges to that of the SYSTEM user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker with low-level privileges to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The ability to run code as SYSTEM can lead to full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have some form of access to the target machine.
*   **DLL Injection:** The specific attack method involves injecting a malicious DLL into the BloxOne Endpoint process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have some kind of low privileged access to the Windows host where the vulnerable BloxOne Endpoint agent is running.
*   **Ability to Place Malicious DLL:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL on the file system where it can be loaded by the vulnerable application.

**Affected Versions:**

*   BloxOne Endpoint for Windows versions **2.3.2 and below**.

**Resolution:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in BloxOne Endpoint for Windows **version 2.3.3 and later**.
*   Version **2.3.6** also fixes the vulnerability and other minor issues.

**CVSS Score:**

*   CVSS: 6.7 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/MAC:H)
