```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input passed through the 'id' parameter in the URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/psrs/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=` endpoint. The 'id' parameter is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In the provided example, the attacker uses a `UNION SELECT` to extract the database name, which proves the ability to execute arbitrary queries.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters. No authentication is required to access the vulnerable page."
