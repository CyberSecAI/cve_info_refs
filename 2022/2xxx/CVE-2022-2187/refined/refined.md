  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin does not escape the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter before outputting it back in an attribute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser session. This can be used to perform actions as that user, steal sensitive data (such as session cookies), or redirect users to malicious websites.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "vector": "The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload within the `REQUEST_URI` parameter. When a user visits this manipulated URL, the injected script executes.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to entice a user to click on the malicious URL. No authentication or other special privileges on the target system are required."
    },
    "affected_component": "WordPress Contact Form 7 Captcha plugin versions prior to 0.1.2",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered in older web browsers due to how the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter is handled. The provided proof of concept shows a sample URL that can be used to exploit the XSS vulnerability."
