## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Download Manager < 3.2.50 - Bypass IP Address Blocking Restriction

### Description

The plugin prioritizes getting a visitor's IP from certain HTTP headers over PHP's REMOTE\_ADDR, which makes it possible to bypass IP-based download blocking restrictions.

### Proof of Concept

When downloading a file, add an X-Forwarded-For header that contains a random IP address to your request.

### Affects Plugins
