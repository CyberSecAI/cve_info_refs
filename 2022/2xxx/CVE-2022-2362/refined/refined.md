- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin prioritizes obtaining a visitor's IP address from certain HTTP headers (like `X-Forwarded-For`) over the server-provided `REMOTE_ADDR`. This allows attackers to spoof their IP address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** IP address spoofing, insecure prioritization of HTTP headers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Bypassing IP-based download blocking restrictions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to restricted files or resources.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
