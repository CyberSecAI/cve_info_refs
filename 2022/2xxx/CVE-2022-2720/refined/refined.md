Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way Octopus Server handles sensitive value masking. When a sensitive value is a substring of another value, the masking process only partially works.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Information exposure due to inadequate masking of sensitive data.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  Partial masking of sensitive information can lead to exposure of that information to unauthorized users, potentially compromising security.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a sensitive value is a substring of another value within the Octopus Server. The exact mechanism of how an attacker would leverage this to gain access is not detailed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The advisory does not specify the attacker's required position or capabilities. The primary requirement is the presence of a sensitive value as a substring of another value.

**Summary:**

The core issue is that the sensitive value masking in Octopus Server fails when a sensitive value is a substring of another value, resulting in incomplete masking and potential information exposure.
