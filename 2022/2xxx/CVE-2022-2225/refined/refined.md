- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cloudflare WARP client allowed users without administrative privileges to use `warp-cli` subcommands (specifically `disable-ethernet` and `disable-wifi`) to bypass Zero Trust security policies and features.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control and insufficient privilege checks when executing `warp-cli` subcommands. Specifically, the client should have restricted the use of `disable-ethernet` and `disable-wifi` to only admin users when enrolled in Zero Trust organization mode.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users could bypass configured Zero Trust security policies (e.g., Secure Web Gateway policies) and features like 'Lock WARP switch', potentially exposing the organization to security threats.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the `warp-cli` command-line interface, an attacker can execute specific commands such as `disable-ethernet` and `disable-wifi`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the Cloudflare WARP client is installed. The attacker also requires to execute commands via the command line interface. They do not require administrative privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
