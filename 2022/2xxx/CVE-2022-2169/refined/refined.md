- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize its settings, allowing high-privilege users to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient output sanitization of settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then execute in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages or post types. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the victim user, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin settings page, where an administrator can inject a malicious payload into the 'specific pages' or 'specific post types' field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or other high-privilege user role within the WordPress site to access the plugin's settings and inject the malicious script.
