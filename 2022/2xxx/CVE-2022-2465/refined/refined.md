Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-2465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of deserialization of untrusted data within the ISaGRAF Workbench software. The software does not limit the objects that can be deserialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The software fails to restrict the types of objects it deserializes, allowing for the potential execution of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the local machine where ISaGRAF Workbench is running. An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ISaGRAF Workbench application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious serialized object.
- The attack requires a local user to open this crafted object using the ISaGRAF Workbench software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious serialized object.
- The attacker must rely on user interaction to open this object in the vulnerable ISaGRAF Workbench application.
- The attacker must have some form of access to the target machine to deliver the malicious file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.6, with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The vulnerability affects ISaGRAF Workbench versions 6.0 through 6.6.9.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
