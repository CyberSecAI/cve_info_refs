The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2075.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the build information request validation within Octopus Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The regex used to validate the build information request is vulnerable to ReDoS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to the Octopus Server becoming unresponsive due to excessive CPU usage. This effectively causes a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted build information request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send requests to the Octopus Server's build information request endpoint. No specific authentication or privileges are mentioned as a requirement for the attack.
