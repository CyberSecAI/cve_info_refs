- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings or through a specific parameter. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser when they access the plugin's settings page or staging site dashboard.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Modifying the input field type of settings (e.g., "Maximum File Size (MB)") from number to text via browser inspector, allowing the injection of malicious code.
    - Sending a crafted `cloneName` parameter via `POST` request to `admin-ajax.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Requires a high-privilege user account, such as an administrator.
    - The attacker needs to be logged in to the WordPress admin panel.
    - Ability to manipulate form fields via a web browser inspector or by sending crafted POST requests.
