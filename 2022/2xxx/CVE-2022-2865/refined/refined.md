{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "GitLab allows importing projects from GitHub, including labels. The color values of these labels are not sanitized during the import process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Inadequate input sanitization",
      "Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, potentially leading to actions performed on behalf of the victim. This can include data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Importing a project from GitHub to GitLab.",
      "Crafting a malicious label color value on the attacker-controlled GitHub repository.",
      "Triggering the import function on GitLab to import the malicious label data."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs control of a GitHub repository where they can create labels with malicious color values. They also need a valid GitLab personal access token and the ability to initiate the import process via the GitLab API.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability bypasses the Content Security Policy (CSP), allowing the injected JavaScript to execute despite the protections put in place. The provided example uses a dummy GitHub server to allow setting arbitrary label colors. The vulnerability is triggered when viewing the labels of the imported project in GitLab."
