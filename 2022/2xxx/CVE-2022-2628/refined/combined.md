## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# DSGVO All in one for WP < 4.2 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Go the DSGVO AIO > Settings Cookie Notice settings and enabled them, then put the following payload in any of the Button Text settings (such as "Button Text (Accept)", "Button Text (Personalize)" and "Button Text (Reject)"): <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be trigged in any frontend page

### Affects Plugins
