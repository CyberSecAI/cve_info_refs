**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper enforcement of behavioral workflow. Specifically, the web application does not properly validate file uploads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Bypass of file extension controls during file upload.
*   Allows for modification of code associated with the initial file upload.
*   Arbitrary file upload into a location where PHP scripts can be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP scripts on the system. This can lead to a variety of impacts, including:
*   Compromise of the system.
*   Potential to change safety critical parameters.
*   System reset or availability issues.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network-based attack through the web interface.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   No special privileges are required, the attacker can be unauthenticated.
*   Ability to intercept and modify the initial file upload page response.
*   Ability to send a crafted request.
