Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied parameters `class` in `/pages/class_sched.php` and `faculty` in `/pages/faculty_sched.php` before using them in SQL queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Data modification: Altering or deleting data.
    *   Denial of service: Disrupting the normal operation of the application.
    *   Potentially gaining full control over the database server, depending on the database permissions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `class` and `faculty` parameters in the URL.
    *   The attack vector is the `search` parameter within the URLs as well which seems to be used along with the vulnerable parameters
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No authentication is specified to be required for the attack.

**Specific Vulnerable Points:**

1.  **`/pages/class_sched.php`:**
    *   The `class` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   The provided payload is:
        ```
        class='||(SELECT 0x684d6b6c WHERE 5993=5993 AND (SELECT 2096 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x717a786b71,(SELECT (ELT(2096=2096,1))),0x717a626271,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a))||'&search=
        ```
2.  **`/pages/faculty_sched.php`:**
    *   The `faculty` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   The provided payload is:
        ```
         faculty=' OR (SELECT 2078 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x716a717071,(SELECT (ELT(2078=2078,1))),0x717a706a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- uYCM&search=
        ```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content includes SQLMap test screenshots, which confirms the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The provided SQL injection payloads are designed to extract database information using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS`, which is common for testing purposes but could be modified to conduct more damaging attacks.
