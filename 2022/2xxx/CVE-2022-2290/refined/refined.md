Based on the provided content, the commit `3faae63b849a1fabc31b823bb7af3a84d32256a7` from the `zadam/trilium` repository addresses an issue where the `Content-Type` header for error responses was not being explicitly set to `text/plain`. This could potentially cause issues with how clients interpret error messages, especially in cases where the default content type is not text.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application was not setting the `Content-Type` header to `text/plain` when sending error responses, relying on default behavior which might not always be `text/plain`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Content-Type header:** This could lead to browsers or other clients misinterpreting error messages, potentially causing display issues or unexpected behavior. Although not a direct security vulnerability, it can be used in attacks that rely on how error responses are presented.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The impact of not setting the correct `Content-Type` is mainly related to the reliability and consistency of how error messages are interpreted by clients. This could make it harder for users to understand what went wrong. This might indirectly cause issues with user experience or be exploited in other attacks if the incorrect content-type can be used in an attack chain.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could trigger server-side errors by sending invalid requests, and observe how the error messages are rendered. If the content-type isn't set to `text/plain`, the attacker can manipulate how the error is interpreted in a potential attack chain, though not a direct security vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests that can cause errors on the server. They don't require any special privileges or access. This is primarily a vulnerability that may cause issues or an attack chain, rather than a direct vulnerability.

**Specific changes in the commit:**

The commit introduces a consistent pattern across multiple files, including:

*   **`src/routes/api/export.js`, `src/routes/api/files.js`, `src/routes/api/image.js`, `src/routes/api/note_revisions.js`, `src/routes/custom.js`, `src/routes/routes.js`, `src/services/auth.js`, and `src/share/routes.js`**: In these files the code now sets the `Content-Type` header to `text/plain` before sending error messages (i.e responses with status codes >= 400).

In summary, while not a major security vulnerability, this commit ensures that error messages are sent with the correct `Content-Type` header, improving the reliability of the application. The changes aim to make sure error messages are correctly interpreted by clients, rather than being treated as `application/json` or `text/html` by default.
