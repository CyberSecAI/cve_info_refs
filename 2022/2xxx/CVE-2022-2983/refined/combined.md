## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Salat Times < 3.2.2 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escapes its settings, allowing high-privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in any text field of Settings > Salat Times: "><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
Save, and the XSS will be triggered when accessing the settings again.
The payload will also be triggered in pages where the [daily\_salat\_times] is embedded.
