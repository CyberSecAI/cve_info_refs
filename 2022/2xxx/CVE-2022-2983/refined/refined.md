- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the settings page or any page where the `[daily_salat_times]` shortcode is used. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>`) into any of the text fields in the plugin's settings via the admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges (or a high-privilege user role) within the WordPress installation to access and modify plugin settings.
