- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "Panel header text" setting in the frontend switcher configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious script into the plugin's settings, which will then be stored in the database. When the settings page or a frontend page is visited, the stored script will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the WordPress site to modify the plugin settings.
