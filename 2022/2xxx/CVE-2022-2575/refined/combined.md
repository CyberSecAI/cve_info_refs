## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WBW Currency Switcher for WooCommerce < 1.6.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

In the plugin's settings (WooCommerce > Settings > Currency > Frontend Switcher), tick "Enable switcher" and put the following payload in the "Panel header text" settings: <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
Save the settings. The XSS will be triggered when viewing the settings page again, as well as in any frontend page
