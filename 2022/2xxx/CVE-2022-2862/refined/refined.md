  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs during the compilation of nested functions when an error occurs. If the compilation of the nested function fails, the allocated local variable might be freed, and then accessed later, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution due to accessing freed memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the compilation of nested functions in Vim9 script. An attacker would need to craft a specific Vim9 script containing nested functions that trigger the error condition during compilation.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted Vim script, which might be achieved through local file access or by convincing a user to open a malicious file. No special privileges are required."
