- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect privilege assignment when private spaces are enabled via the experimental feature flag.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically, new users are granted access to the Script Console within their private space, which they should not have.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to the Script Console. The Script Console allows users to run arbitrary scripts on the server, potentially leading to further compromise if a user was not intended to have access.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the Octopus Server with the experimental private space feature enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Any new user who is created in the affected versions would have the vulnerability. No elevated privileges or previous access is required.
