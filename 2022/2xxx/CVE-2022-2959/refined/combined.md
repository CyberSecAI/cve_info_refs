# Advisory Details

August 24th, 2022
## Linux Kernel Watch Queue Race Condition Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-1165ZDI-CAN-17291

| CVE ID | [CVE-2022-2959](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2959) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Kernel |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of pipe buffers. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Linux has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

pipe: Fix missing lock in pipe\_resize\_ring()

```
pipe_resize_ring() needs to take the pipe->rd_wait.lock spinlock to
prevent post_one_notification() from trying to insert into the ring
whilst the ring is being replaced.

The occupancy check must be done after the lock is taken, and the lock
must be taken after the new ring is allocated.

The bug can lead to an oops looking something like:
