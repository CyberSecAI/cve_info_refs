Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2938:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-2938, with the NetApp advisory (security.netapp.com_e6c33089_20250115_093356.html and security.netapp.com_3cf4a1eb_20250115_223140.html) specifically mentioning "CVE-2022-2938 Linux Kernel Vulnerability in NetApp Products".
   - The commit log from git.kernel.org_826f20d7_20250115_093355.html also provides details about a fix for a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the Linux kernel's psi (Pressure Stall Information) subsystem, which matches the vulnerability described in the NetApp advisories, therefore this content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Pressure Stall Information (PSI) subsystem. 
   - Specifically, when a PSI trigger is destroyed while being polled, the waitqueue associated with that trigger can be freed.  If a pending `poll()` operation tries to access the freed `trigger->event_wait`, it leads to a UAF.
   - This is caused by allowing a write operation on a psi file to replace the old trigger with a new one.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a UAF. Overwriting an existing PSI trigger causes its waitqueue to be freed, but pending `poll()` operations might still have a pointer to the destroyed waitqueue.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - The NetApp advisory states that successful exploitation could lead to:
        - Disclosure of sensitive information.
        - Addition or modification of data.
        - Denial of Service (DoS).
   - The commit message on git.kernel.org states that the vulnerability causes a pending poll() will stumble on trigger->event\_wait which was destroyed which implies the impact is likely a crash of the process using the poll interface.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector involves a local attacker with the ability to perform write operations on the PSI interface and subsequently perform a poll operation, causing a UAF.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - Local access to the system is required.
   - The attacker must have the capability to perform write operations to PSI files and subsequently perform poll operations on file descriptors associated with these triggers.
   -  The attacker must be able to overwrite an existing trigger causing the waitqueue to be destroyed and then trigger a poll operation.

**Additional notes:**
    - The NetApp advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.8 (HIGH) with vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which indicates the vulnerability is considered a high risk and is exploitable locally with low attack complexity and no user interaction necessary.
    - The NetApp advisory lists the affected products and provides information on how to obtain patches.
    - The NetApp advisory indicates they are aware of public discussion on this vulnerability.
    - The commit log provides a detailed explanation of the fix: "Fix this by disallowing to redefine an existing psi trigger. If a write operation is used on a file descriptor with an already existing psi trigger, the operation will fail with EBUSY error." Also mentions bypassing a check for psi\_disabled in the `psi_trigger_destroy`, to prevent a memory leak.
    - The patch involved changes to `Documentation/accounting/psi.rst`, `include/linux/psi.h`, `include/linux/psi_types.h`, `kernel/cgroup/cgroup.c`, and `kernel/sched/psi.c`.
    - The original CVE description states "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval" so the above information provides much more detail than what is provided in the official CVE description.
