Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Undertow's `AjpServerRequestConduit` handles POST requests via the AJP protocol when the request size exceeds the configured `max-post-size` (or `maxEntitySize`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Error Handling:** When a POST request exceeds the maximum size, instead of sending an error response to the client or proxy, the server closes the connection abruptly without a response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The lack of a response causes front-end proxies (like `mod_cluster` and `mod_proxy_balancer`) to mark the backend server as being in an error state.
  - **`mod_cluster` Impact:**  `mod_cluster` will stop forwarding requests to the affected worker until the next STATUS request (every 10 seconds), potentially causing "503 Service Unavailable" errors if all workers are marked as errored.
  - **`mod_proxy_balancer` Impact:** `mod_proxy_balancer` will not forward requests to the worker until a "retry" timeout passes. While it has a "forcerecovery" mechanism, it still can lead to temporary denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious POST Requests:** An attacker can send crafted AJP POST requests with a size exceeding the `maxEntitySize` limit.
- **AJP Protocol:** This vulnerability is specific to requests made over the AJP protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send AJP requests to the vulnerable Undertow server.
- **Knowledge of AJP:** The attacker needs to be aware of the AJP protocol, and the server's configuration, specifically the `maxEntitySize` setting.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The issue was fixed in Undertow versions `2.2.19.Final` and `2.3.0.Alpha2`.
- **Red Hat Products Affected:** Several Red Hat products were affected including Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, and Red Hat Fuse. Specific errata were released to address the issue.
