| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2095862#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2022-06-10 18:58:04 UTC  ``` When a POST request comes through AJP and the request exceeds the max-post-size limit (maxEntitySize), Undertow's AjpServerRequestConduit implementation closes a connection without sending any response to the client/proxy. This behavior results in that a front-end proxy marking the backend worker (application server) as an error state and not forward requests to the worker for a while.  In mod_cluster, this continues until the next STATUS request (10 seconds intervals) from the application server updates the server state. So, in the worst case, it can result in "All workers are in error state" and mod_cluster responds "503 Service Unavailable" for a while (up to 10 seconds). In mod_proxy_balancer, it does not forward requests to the worker until the "retry" timeout passes. However, luckily, mod_proxy_balancer has "forcerecovery" setting (On by default; this parameter can force the immediate recovery of all workers without considering the retry parameter of the workers if all workers of a balancer are in error state.). So, unlike mod_cluster, mod_proxy_balancer does not result in responding "503 Service Unavailable".  An attacker could use this behavior to send a malicious request and trigger server errors, resulting in DoS (denial of service)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2095862#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-10-05 16:32:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2022:6823 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6823](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A6823)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2095862#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-10-05 16:35:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2022:6821 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6821](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A6821)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2095862#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-10-05 16:39:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:6822 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6822](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A6822)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2095862#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-10-05 16:46:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2022:6825 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6825](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A6825)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2095862#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-11-28 14:39:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.11.1  Via RHSA-2022:8652 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8652](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8652)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2095862#c12)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-12-08 21:03:00 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

### Description

When a POST request comes through AJP and the request exceeds the max-post-size limit (maxEntitySize), Undertow's AjpServerRequestConduit implementation closes a connection without sending any response to the client/proxy. This behavior results in that a front-end proxy marking the backend worker (application server) as an error state and not forward requests to the worker for a while.
