- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The weForms plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and output escaping in plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of users who view the affected form. This could lead to various attacks, including stealing cookies, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, and defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) injecting XSS payloads into the 'Message to Show' field within the weForms plugin settings. The injected script is then triggered when a user interacts with the form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative or other high-level privileges to access and modify the weForms settings. The attacker also needs to have the ability to add/edit a form.

The provided text includes a proof of concept (PoC) showing how to inject the XSS payload.
