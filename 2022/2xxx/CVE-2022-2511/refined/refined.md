- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of the `title` parameter, allowing users to inject arbitrary HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary HTML injection, potentially leading to malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors**: URL manipulation by injecting a special value into the `title` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with the vulnerable parameter.
