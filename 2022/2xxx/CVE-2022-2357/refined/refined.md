- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WSM Downloader plugin allows unauthenticated users to download arbitrary local files due to improper handling of user-supplied input in its remote file download feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Unauthenticated arbitrary file download
  - Improper input validation/sanitization
  - Direct Object Reference (DOR)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can download any local files from the server, including sensitive files such as wp-config.php which may contain database credentials and other confidential information.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with a base64 encoded file path in the `dl` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to authenticate, so they can be an unauthenticated remote user.
