| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2105419#c0)  Sage McTaggart    2022-07-08 18:35:59 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Keystone issues tokens with the default lifespan regardless of the lifespan of the application credentials used to issue them. If the configured lifespan of an identity token is set to be 1h, and the application credentials expire in 1 minute from now, a newly issued token will outlive the application credentials used to issue it by 59 minutes.  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create application credentials with short expiration time (e.g. 10 seconds) 2. openstack token issue --> the returned token has standard expiration, for example 1 hour. The script below confirms that the token continue being valid after the application credentials expired.  ```bash #!/usr/bin/env bash  set -Eeuo pipefail  openstack image create --disk-format=raw --container-format=bare --file <(echo 'I am a Glance image') testimage -f json > image.json  image_url="$(openstack catalog show glance -f json | jq -r '.endpoints[] | select(.interface=="public").url')$(jq -r '.file' image.json)"  openstack application credential create \ 	--expiration="$(date --utc --date '+10 second' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)" \ 	token_test \ 	-f json \ 	> appcreds.json  cat <<EOF > clouds.yaml clouds:     ${OS_CLOUD}:         auth:             auth_url: <auth_url>             application_credential_id: '$(jq -r '.id' appcreds.json)'             application_credential_secret: '$(jq -r '.secret' appcreds.json)'         auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"         identity_api_version: 3         interface: public         region_name: <region_name> EOF # Override ~/.config/openstack/secure.yaml touch secure.yaml  openstack token issue -f json > token.json  echo "appcreds expiration: $(jq -r '.expires_at' appcreds.json)" for i in {1..10}; do 	sleep 100 	echo -ne "$(date --utc --rfc-3339=seconds)\t" 	curl -isS -H "X-Auth-Token: $(jq -r '.id' token.json)" --url "$image_url" | head -n1 done  ```  Actual results (on a cloud with tokens duration of 24h): appcreds expiration: 2022-07-08T13:55:02.000000 2022-07-08 13:56:38+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 13:58:19+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:00:00+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:01:42+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:03:23+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:05:07+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:06:49+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:08:37+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:10:18+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:12:00+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Expected results: appcreds expiration: 2022-07-08T13:55:02.000000 2022-07-08 13:54:38+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 13:58:19+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:00:00+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:01:42+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:03:23+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:05:07+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:06:49+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:08:37+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:10:18+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:12:00+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2105419#c1)  Luigi Toscano    2022-07-08 19:29:17 UTC  ``` Which RHOSP version?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2105317#c0)  Pierre Prinetti    2022-07-08 14:15:18 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Keystone issues tokens with the default lifespan regardless of the lifespan of the application credentials used to issue them. If the configured lifespan of an identity token is set to be 1h, and the application credentials expire in 1 minute from now, a newly issued token will outlive the application credentials used to issue it by 59 minutes.  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create application credentials with short expiration time (e.g. 10 seconds) 2. openstack token issue --> the returned token has standard expiration, for example 1 hour. The script below confirms that the token continue being valid after the application credentials expired.  ```bash #!/usr/bin/env bash  set -Eeuo pipefail  openstack image create --disk-format=raw --container-format=bare --file <(echo 'I am a Glance image') testimage -f json > image.json  image_url="$(openstack catalog show glance -f json | jq -r '.endpoints[] | select(.interface=="public").url')$(jq -r '.file' image.json)"  openstack application credential create \ 	--expiration="$(date --utc --date '+10 second' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)" \ 	token_test \ 	-f json \ 	> appcreds.json  cat <<EOF > clouds.yaml clouds:     ${OS_CLOUD}:         auth:             auth_url: <auth_url>             application_credential_id: '$(jq -r '.id' appcreds.json)'             application_credential_secret: '$(jq -r '.secret' appcreds.json)'         auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"         identity_api_version: 3         interface: public         region_name: <region_name> EOF # Override ~/.config/openstack/secure.yaml touch secure.yaml  openstack token issue -f json > token.json  echo "appcreds expiration: $(jq -r '.expires_at' appcreds.json)" for i in {1..10}; do 	sleep 100 	echo -ne "$(date --utc --rfc-3339=seconds)\t" 	curl -isS -H "X-Auth-Token: $(jq -r '.id' token.json)" --url "$image_url" | head -n1 done  ```  Actual results (on a cloud with tokens duration of 24h): appcreds expiration: 2022-07-08T13:55:02.000000 2022-07-08 13:56:38+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 13:58:19+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:00:00+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:01:42+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:03:23+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:05:07+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:06:49+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:08:37+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:10:18+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 14:12:00+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Expected results: appcreds expiration: 2022-07-08T13:55:02.000000 2022-07-08 13:54:38+00:00       HTTP/1.1 200 OK 2022-07-08 13:58:19+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:00:00+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:01:42+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:03:23+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:05:07+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:06:49+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:08:37+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:10:18+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 2022-07-08 14:12:00+00:00       HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2105317#c3)  Nick Tait    2022-09-13 21:15:32 UTC  ``` Please use [CVE-2022-2447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-2447) to track this vulnerability.
