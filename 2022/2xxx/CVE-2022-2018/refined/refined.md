- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application fails to validate user-submitted data (type, length, business parameter validity) and does not effectively filter special characters. This allows user-controlled input to be directly incorporated into database queries, resulting in SQL injection. Specifically, the "Inmates/view_inmate" endpoint's `id` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and direct inclusion of user input in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server. In the provided example, the attacker is able to extract the database user and the database name.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface via HTTP requests to the vulnerable `Inmates/view_inmate` endpoint. The attacker needs to manipulate the `id` parameter with malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application and must be able to submit HTTP requests. The attacker also needs to have a valid username and password to access the admin page. The provided default credentials are `username:admin` and `password: admin123`.
