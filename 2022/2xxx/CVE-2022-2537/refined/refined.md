- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape some parameters before outputting them back in attributes of an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a payload embedded in the `page` and `section` parameters, which is then outputted unsanitized on an admin page. The user is required to click on the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on it. This does not require prior authentication.
