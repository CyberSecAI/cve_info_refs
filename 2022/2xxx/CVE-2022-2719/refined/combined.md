| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2116537#c0)  Todd Cullum    2022-08-08 18:55:25 UTC  ``` In ImageMagick 7.1.0-29, a crafted file could trigger an assertion failure when a call to WriteImages was made in MagickWand/operation.c, due to a NULL image list. This could potentially cause a denial of service. This was fixed in upstream ImageMagick version 7.1.0-30.  References: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/716496e6df0add89e9679d6da9c0afca814cfe49>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2116537#c1)  Todd Cullum    2022-08-08 18:59:52 UTC  ``` Similar but not exactly the same as [CVE-2015-8898](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-8898).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2116537#c2)  Todd Cullum    2022-08-08 19:00:55 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 2116541](show_bug.cgi?id=2116541 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-2719 ImageMagick: Assertion Failure could lead to DoS due to attempted writing of NULL image list [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2116540](show_bug.cgi?id=2116540 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-2719 ImageMagick: Assertion Failure could lead to DoS due to attempted writing of NULL image list [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2116537#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-08-31 23:32:51 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
