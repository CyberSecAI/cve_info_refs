Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing check for a NULL image list before attempting to write images in ImageMagick's `WriteImages` function within `MagickWand/operation.c`. Specifically, when `WriteImages` is called with a NULL image list, it leads to an assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Assertion Failure:** The primary vulnerability is an assertion failure when `WriteImages` is invoked with a NULL image list, causing the program to terminate abruptly.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the image list before writing, allowing the NULL condition to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The assertion failure can cause a denial of service by crashing the application processing the malicious image file. This prevents the application from further processing of images.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file that causes a NULL image list to be passed to the vulnerable `WriteImages` function.
- **Image Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick processes the crafted image file via the MagickWand API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the capability to provide a crafted image file as input to an application that uses a vulnerable version of ImageMagick.
- **No Special Privileges:** Exploitation does not appear to require any special privileges.

**Technical Details:**

* The vulnerable code was in `MagickWand/operation.c` file, around line 4923.
* The fix was implemented by adding a check for a null image list before calling `WriteImages` function.
* The fix was introduced in ImageMagick version 7.1.0-30.
* The commit that fixed the vulnerability is: `https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/716496e6df0add89e9679d6da9c0afca814cfe49`
* A similar issue was reported as CVE-2015-8898, but this is not the same vulnerability.

**Summary of Changes in the fix:**
The following changes were made in `MagickWand/operation.c`:

       write_info=DestroyImageInfo(write_info);
       write_images=DestroyImageList(write_images);
       break;
```

The fix implemented a NULL check on the `write_images` variable prior to calling the `WriteImages` function. This prevents the assertion failure when a NULL list is provided.

**Additional Notes:**
- Red Hat Bugzilla lists this vulnerability as "CLOSED WONTFIX" which suggests that while they acknowledge the issue, a direct fix is not planned for the core packages they provide. However, the individual tracking bugs (`2116540` and `2116541`) for Fedora and EPEL are resolved with errata, indicating that the issue is addressed in those distributions.
