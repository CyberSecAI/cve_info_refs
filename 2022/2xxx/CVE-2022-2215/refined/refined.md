Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The GiveWP plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape currency settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of proper sanitization allows malicious JavaScript code to be stored within the plugin's settings. This code is then executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the currency settings. This code can be used to:
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Steal cookies/session data.
    *   Modify content on the website.
    *   Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/?rest_route=/give-api/v2/onboarding/settings/currency` endpoint.
*   The payload is injected through the `value` parameter.
*   The XSS payload is triggered when editing, viewing or previewing any Donations forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an administrator or a user with high privileges within the WordPress site.
*   The user also needs to have access to the plugin settings.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled, which is often the case in multisite installations.
*   The provided proof of concept uses a REST API endpoint for the exploit, and demonstrates the injection of an XSS payload within a JSON response.
*   The issue is fixed in version 2.21.3 of the GiveWP plugin.
