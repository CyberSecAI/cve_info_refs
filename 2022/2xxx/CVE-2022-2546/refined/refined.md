- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin uses the wrong content type and does not properly escape the response from the `ai1wm_export` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Reflected XSS vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a request that, when submitted by any visitor, will inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the response. This injected code will be executed in the victim's session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, targeting the `ai1wm_export` action. This requires knowledge of a static secret key (`secret_key`), which is stored in the `ai1wm_secret_key` option of the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the static `secret_key` of the target WordPress instance. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They need to induce a victim to submit the crafted form or visit a URL which submits the crafted form.
