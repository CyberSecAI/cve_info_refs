- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks when saving settings. Additionally, it does not properly escape user-supplied input in some settings, which can lead to stored cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unauthenticated arbitrary settings update: Any user can update the plugin's settings without authentication.
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript can be injected through the settings and stored in the database, executing when a user views the affected page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the website, which could lead to various attacks including:
    - User redirection to malicious sites.
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Potential compromise of administrative accounts.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=okapi_wasb_save_settings` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the attack.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
