  "CVE-2022-2078": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `nft_set_desc_concat_parse()` function of the Linux kernel.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow in the kernel's netfilter component.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (kernel crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a specific sequence of nftables rules that leads to a buffer overflow in the `nft_set_desc_concat_parse()` function.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker with the ability to create or modify nftables rules."
