The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2898.

**Root Cause:** Improper link resolution before file access ('Link Following')

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The ScadaPro Server and Client applications do not properly resolve links before accessing files.

**Impact of Exploitation:** This vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition by allowing an attacker to manipulate the link resolution process and potentially cause the application to access an invalid or malicious location.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), with low complexity (AC:L) and requires low privileges (PR:L) and no user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable ScadaPro Server or Client application and be able to create or manipulate files/links.
