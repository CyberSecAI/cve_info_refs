- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin allows user input to reach a sensitive `require_once` call in one of its admin-side templates, leading to Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is triggered via a CSRF attack where an administrator is tricked into visiting a crafted URL that includes a malicious file path to be included with `require_once`. The malicious file is uploaded via the media gallery as a fake `.doc` (zip) file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a user account with at least Author level privileges to be able to upload the malicious `.doc` file via the media gallery. The attacker also needs to trick an administrator into visiting a malicious URL while logged in.
