Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Wedding Hall Booking System (WHBS) application does not properly sanitize user inputs before displaying them on various pages, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The application's lack of input/output handling allows attackers to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple Stored XSS vulnerabilities exist in the application. User-supplied inputs are not sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute when other users or administrators view the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows attackers to:
*   Steal user and administrator cookies, potentially leading to account compromise.
*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to further attacks, such as data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors involve injecting malicious scripts through various input fields in the WHBS. The injected scripts are then stored in the system and executed when the affected pages are viewed by other users or administrators. The affected pages include:
*   Contact Us page (`/whbs/?page=contact_us`)
*   Booking Form (`/whbs/?page=my_bookings`, `/whbs/admin/?page=bookings`)
*   Profile page (`/whbs/?page=manage_account`, `/whbs/?page=profile`)
*  Client lists page (`/whbs/admin/?page=clients`)
*  Staff user profile page (`/whbs/admin/?page=user`, `/whbs/admin/?page=user/list`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the affected application by submitting input through its user interface.
*   The attacker does not need privileged access.
*   The attacker requires knowledge about the susceptible input fields and how to construct malicious XSS payloads.
