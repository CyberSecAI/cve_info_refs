Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The affected software products (Softing Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, and edgeAggregator) ship with default administrator credentials: username `admin` and password `admin`.
*   The applications do not enforce a password change upon initial login or installation.
*   There is no warning or prompt to change the default password and changing it requires multiple steps

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The use of hardcoded default credentials and lack of enforcement of password changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log in to the affected software with administrative privileges.
*   An attacker can perform administrative functions on the affected systems.
*   This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable systems.
*   No special privileges are required initially as the default credentials are well-known.
*   Low attack complexity to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The CISA advisory confirms the vulnerability is exploitable remotely with a low attack complexity.
*   The CISA advisory lists a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 for this vulnerability.
*   The Softing advisory (SYT-2022-6) also indicates a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8.
*   The affected products and fixed versions are clearly identified in both documents.
*   Mitigation advice includes changing the default password or creating a new admin user and removing the default admin account.

This is a straightforward case of default credentials leading to a high severity vulnerability.
