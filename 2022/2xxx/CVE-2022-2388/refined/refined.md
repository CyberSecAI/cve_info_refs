- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Coder" versions prior to 2.5.3 lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting code created by the plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary code snippets created by the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted via a CSRF attack, where a malicious link or form is used to trigger an unintended action within the plugin's functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to click a malicious link or submit a malicious form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target application.
