- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will be executed when a user views the affected page, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data theft.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to be an authenticated user with admin privileges to access the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: High-privilege users, such as administrators, can exploit this vulnerability when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
