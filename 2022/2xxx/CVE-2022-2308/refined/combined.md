If the VDUSE application provides a smaller config space
than the driver expects, the driver may use uninitialized
memory from the stack.

This patch prevents it by initializing the buffer passed by
the driver to store the config value.

This fix addresses CVE-2022-2308.

There are currently no checks in VDUSE kernel driver to ensure the size of the device config space is in line with the features advertised by the VDUSE userspace application. In case of a mismatch, Virtio drivers config read helpers do not initialize the memory indirectly passed to vduse_vdpa_get_config() returning uninitialized memory from the stack. This could cause undefined behavior or data leaks in Virtio drivers.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2103900#c3)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2022-08-20 07:05:03 UTC  ``` Is there more information available on this issue?

If the VDUSE application provides a smaller config space
than the driver expects, the driver may use uninitialized
memory from the stack.

This patch prevents it by initializing the buffer passed by
the driver to store the config value.

This fix addresses CVE-2022-2308.
