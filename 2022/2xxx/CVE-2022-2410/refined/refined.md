- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. When a user accesses the affected settings, the script will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a malicious payload into the delimiter settings of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (or a user with the unfiltered_html capability disallowed) to modify the plugin settings.
