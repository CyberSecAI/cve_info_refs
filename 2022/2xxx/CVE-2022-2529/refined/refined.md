- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The sflow decode package is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to its handling of malformed packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of malformed sflow packets. Specifically, the code consumes excessive memory when processing these packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack leads to a denial of service, as the process consumes large amounts of memory, potentially crashing the application or causing it to become unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can craft and send malformed sflow packets to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the service where the vulnerable `goflow` library is running. A publicly reachable goflow collector would be the most vulnerable.
