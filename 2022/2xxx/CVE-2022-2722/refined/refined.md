- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data disclosure, data modification, or denial of service. The provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract database and user information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
