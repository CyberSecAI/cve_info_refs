- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability resides in the `dlpfde.sys` driver. It allows a user to make system calls that lead to a kernel stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A kernel stack overflow vulnerability exists due to improper handling of system calls within the `dlpfde.sys` driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a system crash, specifically a blue screen of death (BSOD).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a user who is already logged into the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system and be logged in as a user.
