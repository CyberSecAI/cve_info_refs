The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2119.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory within the Service Class Provider (SCP) of the DCMTK software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The SCP allows writing DICOM files into arbitrary directories, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution.
- Ability to write malicious DICOM files into arbitrary directories.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation is possible from an adjacent network (AV:A).
- Low attack complexity (AC:H).
- No privileges are required (PR:N), and no user interaction is necessary (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be on the same network segment or a reachable network to exploit the vulnerability.
- An attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
