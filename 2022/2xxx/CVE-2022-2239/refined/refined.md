The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2239.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Request a Quote" fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings within its configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin settings do not sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access affected pages. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with administrative privileges (or a user with sufficient privileges) can inject malicious JavaScript into the plugin settings, specifically the "Misc > No Access Message" setting.
- The XSS payload is triggered when a user without sufficient privileges accesses a quote.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges or equivalent to access the plugin's settings page and modify the vulnerable settings.
