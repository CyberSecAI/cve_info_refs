Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Affiliates Manager plugin fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied affiliate data, specifically in the `Firstname`, `Lastname`, or `Company` fields during affiliate registration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSV Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas into these fields. When an administrator exports affiliate data as a CSV file, these formulas are executed when the file is opened using spreadsheet software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious formulas, attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on the administrator's machine when the CSV file is opened. This may lead to data theft or system compromise.
*   **Data Modification/Manipulation:** Attackers may also be able to modify data within the spreadsheet software via the injected formulas.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Affiliate Registration:** Attackers register as affiliates and insert malicious payloads into their `Firstname`, `Lastname`, or `Company` profile fields.
*   **CSV Export:** An administrator exports the affiliate data to a CSV file.
*   **CSV Opening:** The administrator opens the exported CSV file using spreadsheet software that processes the malicious formulas.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Register as Affiliate:** The attacker needs to be able to register as an affiliate to input malicious data.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is a CSV Injection issue (CWE-1236).
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.4 (Medium).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.9.14 of the Affiliates Manager plugin.
