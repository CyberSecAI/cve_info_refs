## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Affiliates Manager < 2.9.14 - Affiliate CSV Injection

### Description

The plugin does not validate and sanitise the affiliate data, which could allow users registering as affiliate to perform CSV injection attacks against an admin exporting the data

### Proof of Concept

Register as an affiliate and put the following payload in the Firstname, Lastname or Company fields: =10+2+30
As admin, export the Affiliates as CSV (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpam-affiliates&tab=export\_data) and open the CSV. The formula from the payload will be processed
