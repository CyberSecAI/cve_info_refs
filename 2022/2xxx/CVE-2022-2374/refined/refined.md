- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "CUSTOM CSS" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with admin privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who view pages or posts with the plugin's shortcode embedded, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically the "CUSTOM CSS" input field under style settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as an admin user, to access and modify the plugin's settings. The attack requires the user to view a page or post with the vulnerable shortcode embedded to trigger the XSS.
