## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simply Schedule Appointments < 1.5.7.7 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Navigate to style settings: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=simply-schedule-appointments%2F#/ssa/settings/styles
Put the following payload as "CUSTOM CSS": </style><script>alert(1)</script>
The XSS will be triggered in pages/posts where the shortcode for any appointment ([ssa\_booking type=]) is embed

### Affects Plugins
