## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Digital Publications by Supsystic < 1.7.4 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create new publication, name it whatever
2. Click the "Custom Page" tab to add a new page:
- name it with the desired payload as the title: `aaa" onclick='alert(123);' ">`
- select the publication you just created by checking the box next to it.
- click publish
3. Go back to the list of publications, open the one you created and go to the "All Pages" tab:
- click on the title of the page created in 2, and the payload triggers
