- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating a new publication and crafting a malicious payload within the page title, the XSS can be triggered when viewing the publication pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as admin access, to create publications and add pages with custom titles within the vulnerable plugin.
