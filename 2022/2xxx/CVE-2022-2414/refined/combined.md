### @ckelleyRH **[ckelleyRH](/ckelleyRH)** commented [Jun 10, 2022](#issue-1267768642)

This reduces the vulnerability of XML parsers to XXE (XML external

entity) injection.

The best way to prevent XXE is to stop using XML altogether, which we do

plan to do. Until that happens I consider it worthwhile to tighten the

security here though.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I considered making a class similar to `JSONSerializer` but it felt like too much work for deprecated code, that is actively marked for removal. Therefore I just added in the necessary updates per-instantiation. |

| It's a shame that Sonar doesn't work on PRs (yet) because then we could have checked that I caught them all. |
