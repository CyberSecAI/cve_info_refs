{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin does not implement nonce checks when handling the `crawDataAjax` action.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Missing nonce check"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can make a logged-in administrator trigger unwanted crawls on third-party sites. This could lead to information disclosure if the attacker controls the third party site or resource exhaustion of the victim's server by targeting internal endpoints.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a crafted `url` parameter, an attacker can make the server perform requests to arbitrary external or internal URLs.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to send a crafted request. Since there are no CSRF mitigations, this is trivial to do with social engineering."
