- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape user input provided in its forms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's form fields, which will be executed when an administrator views the related entry. This allows attackers to potentially perform actions with admin privileges, such as stealing cookies or redirecting users.
- **Attack vectors**: By submitting a crafted payload in the Name, Subject, and Message fields of a contact form created with the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can submit the malicious form data from a page/post where the contact form created via the plugin is located.
