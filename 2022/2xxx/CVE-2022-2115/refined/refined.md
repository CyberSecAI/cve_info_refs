- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into a frontend page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to user session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By appending a malicious payload to a URL containing the `paoc_details` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload that is then visited by a victim user. The attacker does not require any specific access or privilege to exploit the vulnerability.
