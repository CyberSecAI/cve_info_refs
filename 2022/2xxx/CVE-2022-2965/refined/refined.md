The provided content relates to a commit that addresses a missing `X-Frame-Options` header, which is a security vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The web application was missing the `X-Frame-Options` header in HTTP responses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of `X-Frame-Options` header

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Clickjacking attacks: An attacker could embed the vulnerable web application within an iframe on a malicious website. By overlaying deceptive elements on top of the iframe, they can trick users into performing unintended actions (e.g., clicking buttons or filling out forms) within the legitimate application, thereby compromising user data or application functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Embedding the vulnerable web application in an iframe within a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious website where they can embed the vulnerable application within an iframe.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim to the malicious website.

**Mitigation:**
The commit adds `header("X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN");` to the `login.php`, `password_reset.php` and `header.inc` files. This header ensures that the application can only be loaded in an iframe if the frame's origin is the same as the application's origin, thus preventing clickjacking attacks from external websites.
