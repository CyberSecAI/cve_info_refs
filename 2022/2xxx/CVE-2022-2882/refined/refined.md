          "root_cause": "The Github integration allows changing the server URL without resetting the previously configured access token.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "The access token is not cleared when the server URL is modified.",

          "impact": "A malicious user (maintainer) can change the server URL to a user-controlled server, where the attacker can then extract the leaked Github access token. This token gives the attacker API access to the victim's Github account, potentially allowing further compromise of resources.",
          "attack_vectors": [
            "Modification of the Github integration settings by a user with maintainer privileges"
