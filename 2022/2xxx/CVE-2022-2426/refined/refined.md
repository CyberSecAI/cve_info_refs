- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings. These scripts would then be executed in the browsers of other administrators accessing the settings page.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting a malicious payload into any of the plugin settings via the admin panel
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to modify the plugin settings.
