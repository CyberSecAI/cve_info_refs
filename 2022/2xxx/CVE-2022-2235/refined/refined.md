{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ZenTao issue integration does not properly sanitize the 'url' field in the API response from the ZenTao server, allowing for the injection of a JavaScript URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the 'url' field and unsafe HTML injection due to lack of HTML encoding in the 'id' field.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser on self-hosted GitLab instances.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious API response from a fake ZenTao server. The victim must visit the GitLab page displaying the issue details which renders the malicious data and click on the manipulated link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or have access to a ZenTao server configured as an external issue tracker on the GitLab instance, and needs to be able to modify the API responses. Additionally, a user on the GitLab instance must visit the crafted link."
