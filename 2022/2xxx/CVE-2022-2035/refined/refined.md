Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-2035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It exists because the `playerConfUrl` parameter in the `/defaultui/player/modern.html` file of SCORM Engine does not validate the format or domain of the provided URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application reflects user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the victim's browser.
- Lack of input validation: The `playerConfUrl` parameter does not restrict the URL's domain or format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Account takeover
  - Data theft
  - Redirection to malicious sites
- Tenable mentions a potential for "full account takeover" against `cloud.scorm.com` users, and notes a varying impact for other LMS integrations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL, including a javascript payload, and tricking the victim into accessing it.
- The malicious javascript can be loaded from an external site or directly passed via a `data:` URI.
- The `playerConfUrl` parameter is the vehicle for injecting the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker must then entice a user to click or access the crafted link.

**Affected Products:**
- SCORM Engine versions prior to 20.1.45.914
- SCORM Engine versions 21.1.x prior to 21.1.7.219

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `loadCode(playerConfigurationurl,false)` function in `/defaultui/src/js/integration/loader.js`.
- The vulnerability has been patched in newer versions of SCORM Engine.
- The initial vulnerability report was made by Tenable's Evan Grant.
- There is no authentication required to exploit the vulnerability.
