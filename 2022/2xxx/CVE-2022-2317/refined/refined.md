- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient checking of a user-supplied parameter, specifically `level_identifier`, during the registration process. The plugin uses an MD5 hash of the membership level as a parameter but does not validate it against the actual membership level intended by the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated privilege escalation. The plugin does not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `level_identifier` parameter to obtain a higher membership level than intended.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can register with a higher-level membership than they are supposed to have, potentially accessing restricted content and features. This affects the plugin's internal membership system but not WordPress roles.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/membership-join/membership-registration/` with a manipulated `level_identifier` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit this vulnerability remotely. They need the ability to send HTTP POST requests. They also need to know the MD5 hash of the desired membership level.
