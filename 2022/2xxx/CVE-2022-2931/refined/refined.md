```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `cache_collection_render` function within GitLab's markdown processing logic. The function fails to efficiently handle specially-crafted input, leading to excessive CPU consumption.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Inefficient markdown processing",
    "Lack of input sanitization or resource limitation in `cache_collection_render`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the GitLab server becomes unresponsive due to high CPU usage. Multiple requests in parallel can amplify the effect, making the server completely unavailable.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Markdown Preview API (`/api/v4/markdown`) with a specially crafted payload.",
    "Issue creation or update with a specially crafted description."
  ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users through the Markdown Preview API, and authenticated users through issue creation or update. An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with crafted payloads to a GitLab instance."
