- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape the slide title before outputting it in the admin pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the slide title, which will then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the code is embedded. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious website, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the slide title field within the plugin's admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with author-level privileges or higher. The 'unfiltered_html' capability does not need to be enabled.
