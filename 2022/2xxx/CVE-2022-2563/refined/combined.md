## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Tutor LMS < 2.0.10 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape some course parameters, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Create/Edit a Course, add a new Topic and put the following payload as Topic Name: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be trigged when editing the topic
Create/edit a lesson (Click on a topic to display the create button), then put the following payload in the Lesson Name field: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be triggered when editing the lesson
