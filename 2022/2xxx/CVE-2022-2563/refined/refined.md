- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Tutor LMS plugin fails to properly escape certain course parameters, specifically within topic and lesson names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges, such as an administrator, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the affected fields. This injected code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the compromised content within the plugin's interface.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack is carried out by adding a malicious payload as a topic name or lesson name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as an administrator role, within the WordPress environment. They need to be able to create or edit courses and add topics/lessons.
