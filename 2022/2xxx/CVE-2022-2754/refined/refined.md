The content is related to CVE-2022-2754.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape reservation parameters before using them in SQL statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can perform SQL Injection attacks which can allow them to potentially access or modify data in the database. The provided exploit uses `SLEEP` to demonstrate a blind SQL injection attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP POST requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` by providing malicious data in the `data` parameter when creating a reservation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to access the website with the vulnerable plugin installed. They also need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
