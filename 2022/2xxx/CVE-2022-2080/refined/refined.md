- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate the sender of a private message, allowing any authenticated user to send messages to arbitrary private conversations. This is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can send messages to any private conversation between a teacher and student. However, the attacker cannot see the replies or existing messages within the conversation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a POST request to `/wp-comments-post.php` with a modified `comment_post_ID` parameter to target a specific private conversation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.
