- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the "Field Error Message" setting, which allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or data theft.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a high-privileged user (Admin+) who can create or edit comment fields and insert a malicious payload in the "Error Message" setting. The XSS is triggered when a user views any post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator or similar high-level access to modify the plugin's settings.
