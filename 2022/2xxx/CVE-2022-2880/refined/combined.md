Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.19.2 and 1.18.7, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 3 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* archive/tar: unbounded memory consumption when reading headers

  Reader.Read did not set a limit on the maximum size of file headers.

  A maliciously crafted archive could cause Read to allocate unbounded

  amounts of memory, potentially causing resource exhaustion or panics.

  Reader.Read now limits the maximum size of header blocks to 1 MiB.

  Thanks to Adam Korczynski (ADA Logics) and OSS-Fuzz for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-2879 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/54853>.
* net/http/httputil: ReverseProxy should not forward unparseable query parameters

  Requests forwarded by ReverseProxy included the raw query parameters from the

  inbound request, including unparseable parameters rejected by net/http. This

  could permit query parameter smuggling when a Go proxy forwards a parameter

  with an unparseable value.

  ReverseProxy will now sanitize the query parameters in the forwarded query

  when the outbound request's Form field is set after the ReverseProxy.Director

  function returns, indicating that the proxy has parsed the query parameters.

  Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward the original

  query parameters unchanged.

  Thanks to Gal Goldstein (Security Researcher, Oxeye) and

  Daniel Abeles (Head of Research, Oxeye) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-2880 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/54663>.
* regexp/syntax: limit memory used by parsing regexps

  The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input,

  but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000,

  making relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory.

  Each regexp being parsed is now limited to a 256 MB memory footprint.

  Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that

  are now rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.

  Thanks to Adam Korczynski (ADA Logics) and OSS-Fuzz for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-41715 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/55949>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.19.2>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.19.2` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Carlos and Dmitri for the Go team

## Description

![@neild](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52544?u=41bff20219d93918578944360c3930f30df4693b&v=4&size=48)[neild](https://github.com/neild)opened [on Aug 24, 2022](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/54663#issue-1350007680)

We generally treat malformed value pairs in URL queries as a soft error, ignoring the invalid pair but accepting others. For example, the following ([playground link](https://go.dev/play/p/XTtPo1ouI3K)) accepts the value for the key `b` even as it rejects the invalid one for `a`:

```
u, _ := url.Parse("http://go.dev/?a=%x&b=ok")
v, err := url.ParseQuery(u.RawQuery)
fmt.Println(v, err)
// map[b:[ok]] invalid URL escape "%x"

```

`ReverseProxy` should not include unparseable query parameters when forwarding a request, since this is a vector for parameter smuggling. In Go 1.17, we changed URL parsing to reject keys containing a semicolon (<https://go.dev/issue/25192>). If a Go 1.17 `ReverseProxy` forwards a request to a backend which treats semicolons as a parameter separator (as Go 1.16 and earlier did), the proxy and backend may disagree on the parameter values of the request.
