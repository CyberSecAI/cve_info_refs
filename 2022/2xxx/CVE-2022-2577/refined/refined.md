Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data within the Garage Management System. Specifically, the application fails to filter special characters within the `id` parameter of the `/edituser.php` page. This allows a malicious user to inject SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the failure to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:**  An attacker could potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database by manipulating SQL queries. In the provided example, the attacker is able to determine the current database user by using `user()` function in the SQL query.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Depending on the database structure and the privileges of the database user, the attacker might gain unauthorized access to other parts of the application or even the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/edituser.php` page, with a maliciously crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL injection techniques.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Garage Management System.
*   **No authentication:** An attacker can use this vulnerability even if not authenticated on the application, but to access the page, must log into the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `id` in the `/edituser.php` script.
*   The provided payload demonstrates how to use `UNION SELECT` to extract information from the database (`/edituser.php?id=-2'%20UNION%20select%2011,user(),333,444--+`).
*   The content provides the default login credentials for the system (username: admin, password: admin123)
