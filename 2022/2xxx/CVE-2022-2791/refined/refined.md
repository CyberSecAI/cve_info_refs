- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software allows unrestricted upload of files with dangerous file types. Specifically, the software will upload any file written into the PLC logic folder to the connected PLC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow for remote hidden code execution on the connected programmable logic controller (PLC) and for malicious files to be uploaded from the PLC to connected workstations.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading malicious files to the PLC logic folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access (AV:L) and low privileges (PR:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R) to upload the malicious file to the PLC. The scope is changed (S:C) after the malicious file is uploaded.
