Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2568:

**Root Cause:**
A logic flaw in the Ansible Automation Platform allowed a user with 'change user' permissions to modify parameters of a superuser account via the API, which was not possible via the UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient access control:** The API endpoint for user modification did not properly enforce restrictions on who could modify superuser accounts.
- **Privilege escalation:** The ability to modify superuser settings allowed a user to escalate their privileges and gain control over the system.
- **Missing UI restriction on superuser modification**: The UI correctly blocked modification, but the API did not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker with "change user" permission could modify or remove superuser privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Account Takeover**: An attacker could modify the superuser account parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The primary attack vector was through the API endpoint, specifically a PATCH request to modify user details.
-  Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited by sending a PATCH request to the `/api/automation-hub/_ui/v1/users/1/` endpoint to change parameters of user 1 (assumed to be the admin/superuser account).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with 'change user' permissions within the Ansible Automation Platform.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make API requests to the affected Ansible Automation Platform instance.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.1 for RHEL 8 (RHSA-2022:6078) and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.2 for RHEL 8 and 9 (RHSA-2022:6079).
- The provided bug report includes an example HTTP request demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
