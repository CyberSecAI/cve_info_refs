## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Top Bar < 3.0.4 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings before outputting them in frontend pages, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Content > Message settings of the plugin: <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered in all frontend pages

### Affects Plugins
