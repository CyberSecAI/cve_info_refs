- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings before displaying them on frontend pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high privilege user, such as an administrator, can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users browsing the site. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and information theft. This can occur even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, which is common in multisite WordPress installations.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject a malicious payload into the plugin's settings via the admin interface, specifically in the Content > Message setting. The XSS is triggered when a user views any frontend page of the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress site's backend.
