The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2002.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an untrusted pointer dereference. The affected software dereferences a pointer using data from a faulting address that controls code flow starting at `gmmiObj!CGmmiOptionContainer`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Untrusted Pointer Dereference (CWE-822)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local. The attacker requires local access to the device or system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires local access to the affected system and must be able to influence the data from the faulting address used for the pointer dereference. A user interaction is also required to trigger the vulnerability.
