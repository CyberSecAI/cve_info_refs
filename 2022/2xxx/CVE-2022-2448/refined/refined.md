- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected settings page or other pages where the unsanitized settings are displayed. This can lead to various attacks including session hijacking, account takeover, defacement, and malware injection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be logged in with high privilege user access (such as admin) and craft a malicious POST request to the options.php file with the vulnerable settings field containing malicious javascript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges on the WordPress site.
