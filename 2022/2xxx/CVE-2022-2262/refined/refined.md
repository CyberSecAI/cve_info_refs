Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to validate and sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `edit_all_room.php` script is vulnerable.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly includes the user-controlled `id` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The application does not validate the type, length, or business logic validity of the input data.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Special characters in user input are not effectively filtered or escaped before being used in SQL queries.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
    *   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, modification of data, or even complete compromise of the database.
    *   **Potential Application Takeover:** Depending on the database user's privileges and the application's design, an attacker might gain control over the application itself.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Injection of time-based payloads like `SLEEP` can lead to denial-of-service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `id` parameter in the URL of `edit_all_room.php` (e.g., `/edit_all_room.php?id=INJECTED_SQL`).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web application.
    *   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests and inject SQL payloads into the URL.
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the CMS (admin access is mentioned), however this might not be required to exploit the SQL injection.
    
**Technical Details:**
* The provided payload ` %27%20AND%20(SELECT%203766%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))BmIK)%20AND%20%27YLPl%27=%27YLPl` demonstrates a time-based SQL injection. It utilizes the `SLEEP(5)` function to cause a 5-second delay in the server's response, which can be observed by the attacker to confirm the vulnerability.
* The SQL injection can be exploited using tools such as sqlmap.
