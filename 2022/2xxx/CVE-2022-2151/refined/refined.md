Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of sanitization and escaping of plugin settings, specifically the "No Access Message" within the "wp-easy-contact" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input in its settings. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed when the settings page is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks including:
    *   Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Settings:** The attacker exploits the plugin's settings page, specifically the "No Access Message" field, to inject the malicious script.
*   **User Interaction:** The XSS is triggered when a user without sufficient privileges attempts to access a quote, thus displaying the "No Access Message" which contains the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privilege User (Admin+):** The attacker needs to have high-level user privileges, such as an administrator, to access and modify the plugin's settings.
*   **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress admin panel to modify the settings of the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the "wp-easy-contact" plugin prior to 3.8.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the attack by injecting `<script>alert(/XSS/);</script>` into the "No Access Message" setting.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation), mapped to OWASP A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   The CVSS score is 3.4 (Low), although the potential impact could be greater depending on the specific malicious payload used.
