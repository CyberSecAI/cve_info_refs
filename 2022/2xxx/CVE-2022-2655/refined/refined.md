The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2655.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize a generated URL before outputting it in an HTML attribute within an admin page. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that can be executed by the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform other harmful actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL with a malicious script and tricking an admin user to visit the URL, the attacker can execute the script. The vulnerable URLs are `/all-ads/` and `/all-properties/` pages in the admin panel of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in admin user to visit the malicious link.
