{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, stealing cookies, or redirecting users to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload in the `pos-name` parameter. The `custom-popup` parameter must point to an existing popup ID.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a specific URL containing the malicious JavaScript and trick a user into clicking the link. No prior authentication is required, and the attack can be initiated remotely."
