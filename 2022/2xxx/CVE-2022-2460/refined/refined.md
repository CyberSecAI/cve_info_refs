- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to potentially read or modify the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request to the `post_one.php` file with malicious input in the `sender_id` and `receiver_id` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, as the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
