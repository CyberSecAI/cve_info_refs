- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape table data before inserting it into a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation**: High-privilege users (Admin+) can perform SQL Injection attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/tools.php` endpoint with a malicious payload within the `bsr_data` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated as a high-privilege user (Admin+).
