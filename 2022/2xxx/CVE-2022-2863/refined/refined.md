Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2863

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress plugin - WPvivid Backup versions prior to 0.9.76

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the `file_name` parameter before using it to read a file, which allows path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):**  The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `file_name` parameter. This allows an attacker to use directory traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the webserver that the webserver process has access to. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information such as configuration files, database credentials, or other application files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP request to the `admin-ajax.php` file, specifically the `wpvivid_download_export_backup` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated High-Privilege User:** The attacker must be logged in as a user with administrative privileges.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter:** The attacker must know that the `wpvivid_download_export_backup` action is vulnerable and that the `file_name` parameter can be manipulated.

**Technical Details:**
*   A vulnerable request would include:
    ```
    https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?_wpnonce={{nonce}}&action=wpvivid_download_export_backup&file_name=../../../../../../../etc/passwd&file_size=922
    ```
    where `{{nonce}}` is a valid nonce. The `file_name` parameter is manipulated to perform path traversal in order to read the `/etc/passwd` file.

**CVSS Score:**
*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H - Base Score 7.2 (from seclists.org)
*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N - Base Score 4.1 (Medium) (from wpscan.com). Note the scope is changed which reduces the score, and the impact is changed to low for Confidentiality.

**Mitigation:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.9.76 of the WPvivid Backup plugin, which implements proper sanitization of the file path. Users should upgrade to the latest version of the plugin to remediate this vulnerability.
