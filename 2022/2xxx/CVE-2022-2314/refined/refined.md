Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2314

**Vulnerability Description:** The VR Calendar plugin for WordPress, versions prior to 2.3.2, is vulnerable to an unauthenticated arbitrary function call. This means that an attacker can execute any PHP function on the WordPress site without needing to log in.

**Root Cause:** The plugin allows any user to execute arbitrary PHP functions. The `vrc_cmd` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to pass in a function name such as 'phpinfo' to execute.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   **Arbitrary Function Call:** The plugin allows execution of arbitrary PHP functions.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `vrc_cmd` parameter is not validated before being used, allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to complete control of the website, data theft, defacement, or denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use functions like `phpinfo()` to gather sensitive information about the server configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a simple HTTP GET request to `wp-admin/admin-post.php` with the `vrc_cmd` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress website.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) is: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php?vrc_cmd=phpinfo`. This demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using the phpinfo() function.
*   The vulnerability has been classified as a Command Injection issue and is related to OWASP Top 10 A1: Injection. It is also mapped to CWE-78.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.2 of the VR Calendar plugin.
