The provided content relates to CVE-2022-2831.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in thumbnail extractor. The code did not cast to a 64-bit value when calculating the expected size of the thumbnail data buffer which could lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability (read/write) in the thumbnail extraction process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially achieve code execution by exploiting the out-of-bounds memory read/write vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
A specially crafted image file loaded into Blender can trigger the vulnerability during thumbnail creation, particularly when the thumbnail is flipped vertically. This can be triggered via the `blender-thumbnailer` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .blend file which will cause the vulnerable code to trigger when creating a thumbnail.
