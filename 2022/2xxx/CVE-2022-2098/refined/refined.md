      "cve": "CVE-2022-2098",
      "content": "The provided commit introduces input length validation for password fields, specifically setting `maxlength` to 50 and `minlength` to 8 in the `changePassword.html` and `register.html` files. It also introduces password validation using `frontend_helpers.js`. In the `changePassword.js` and `register.js` files, password validation is implemented to ensure the password meets certain complexity criteria, with the UI showing feedback to the user. Furthermore, the `signIn.js` file was modified to not remove the `is-invalid` class from the email and password field if the reset password functionality fails. \n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The commit addresses insufficient input validation for password fields by adding `minlength` and `maxlength` attributes to the input fields and introducing a JavaScript-based password validation function. The previous state allowed for the submission of weak or very long passwords that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Inadequate password complexity requirements. By setting a minimum length and maximum length, the system prevents unusually short or long passwords. The introduced password validation function in `frontend_helpers.js` likely adds additional complexity checks that are not shown in this diff.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Without the added password restrictions, attackers could have potentially used weak passwords, leading to easier unauthorized access to accounts. Additionally, excessive length on the password fields can lead to buffer overflows or other unexpected errors, though this is less likely in this specific context.\n\nAttack vectors: A user or attacker could attempt to use a short or long password, or one that does not meet the complexity criteria, to access the system or create an account.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be a user of the application who is attempting to change their password, register a new account, or use the reset password functionality.",
      "additional_details": "The diff shows changes related to password validation, including:\n\n*   Adding `maxlength` and `minlength` attributes to password input fields in `changePassword.html` and `register.html`.\n*   Importing and using a `validatePassword` function in `changePassword.js` and `register.js`.\n*   Displaying real-time feedback to the user about the password's validity.\n*   Fixing a UI error in `signIn.js` to properly display the error when the reset password functionality fails.\n*   No specific vulnerability is mentioned in the commit message except that it is \"fixed further security vulnerabilities adding additional password validation\".\n\nThe commit addresses the lack of password complexity requirements by setting minimum and maximum lengths and introducing JavaScript-based validation with user feedback."
