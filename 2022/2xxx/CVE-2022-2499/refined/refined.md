Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE-2022-2499:** This CVE refers to an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** vulnerability in GitLab's Jira integration feature.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from GitLab directly using the issue key provided in the URL to fetch Jira issue details without validating it against the configured project key. When accessing a specific Jira issue's details page within a GitLab project's integration, the system uses the `KEY` parameter from the URL (`/-/integrations/jira/issues/KEY-1`) to fetch the issue from Jira via the API. However, it does not verify that the `KEY` belongs to the configured project, leading to IDOR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system relies on user-provided input (the issue key) to directly access and retrieve sensitive information without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to Jira issue details from projects that the victim (GitLab project maintainer) has access to, even if the attacker does not have direct access to those projects in Jira. This leaks sensitive data from potentially private Jira projects.
-   **Data Manipulation:** By referencing private Jira issue keys in GitLab commits and merge requests, an attacker can add data to these private issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attacker manipulates the issue key in the URL when accessing a Jira issue details page within GitLab's Jira integration.
-   The attacker can also add data to private Jira issues via commit messages or MRs by referencing private Jira issue keys, due to Jira integration functionality of referencing Jira issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have access to a GitLab project where the Jira integration with "View Jira Issues" is enabled and configured by the maintainer (the victim).
-   The attacker must know or guess an issue key from a different Jira project than the one configured in the GitLab project, which the victim user also has access to.

**Technical Details:**
- The GitLab backend makes a request like `https://username.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/KEY-1?&expand=renderedFields` to the Jira API, using the key directly from the URL. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `KEY-1` is not validated.
- The attacker can modify the `KEY` part in the URL to any valid Jira issue key. For example, by changing `/-/integrations/jira/issues/PUBLIC-2` to `/-/integrations/jira/issues/PRIVATE-1`, the attacker can access a private issue from the `PRIVATE` project.
