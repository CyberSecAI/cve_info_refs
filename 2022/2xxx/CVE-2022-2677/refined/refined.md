```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `/index.php` file of the Apartment Visitor Management System where the `password` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in the `password` parameter.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, modifying or deleting data, or even gaining full control over the database server.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is through the login form of the application, specifically via the `password` parameter in the `/index.php` file.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the login form of the application.
