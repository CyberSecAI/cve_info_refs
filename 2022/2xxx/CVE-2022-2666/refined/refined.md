Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The primary root cause is the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code that alters the query's logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple locations, specifically within the `login.php` and `delete_lplan.php` files.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** User-provided data is directly concatenated into SQL queries, making the system susceptible to injection attacks.
*   **Absence of Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:** The code fails to use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which are designed to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and other confidential information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues and potential disruption of services.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting malicious SQL code, attackers might bypass authentication mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to privileged functionalities.
*   **Denial of Service:** Through time-based SQL injection, attackers could cause delays and potential denial-of-service scenarios.
*   **System Compromise:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can be used to gain further access to the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** In `login.php`, the `username` and `password` parameters in a POST request are vulnerable.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** In `delete_lplan.php`, the `lplan_id` parameter in a GET request is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Application Endpoints:** Attackers need to know the vulnerable endpoints (`login.php`, `delete_lplan.php`).
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** Attackers need knowledge of SQL injection techniques and payloads to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** Attackers need to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Specific Vulnerability Details from the Content:**

*   **login.php:** The content explicitly mentions the lack of `bind_param` and shows screenshots demonstrating that the username and password parameters are vulnerable to both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection.
*   **delete_lplan.php:** The `lplan_id` parameter is susceptible to time-based blind SQL injection as demonstrated via sqlmap output. The code snippets highlight direct use of user input in queries.
*   The sqlmap output shows the injection points, the type of injection, the payloads used for detection, and confirms the back-end database as MySQL.
