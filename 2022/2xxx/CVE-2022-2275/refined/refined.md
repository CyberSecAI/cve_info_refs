- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "WP Edit Menu" lacks CSRF protection in an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary posts/pages from the blog.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, triggers the vulnerable AJAX action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the crafted form, often done through social engineering or embedding the form in a malicious website.
