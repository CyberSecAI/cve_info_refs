Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-2085:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `gx_default_create_buf_device()` function within Ghostscript.
*   This occurs when Ghostscript attempts to render a large number of bits in memory, specifically when the bits per pixel (bpp) is greater than 64.
*   When allocating a buffer device, it relies on an `init_device_procs` defined for the device. The device used as a prototype depends on the bpp. For bpp > 64, `mem_x_device` is used which does not have an `init_device_procs` defined.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is dereferencing a null pointer.  When `mem_x_device` is used as a prototype, it does not have an `init_device_procs` which leads to a null pointer when the code attempts to call `mdev->initialize_device_procs((gx_device *)mdev)`.
*   **Missing Null Check:** The code does not check if `mdproto->initialize_device_procs` is NULL before using it. This lack of a null check allows the program to proceed using a null pointer, causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the application using Ghostscript, due to the null pointer dereference. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Document:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted PostScript or PDF document that triggers the vulnerability. The document needs to specify a device with a high number of bits per pixel (bpp > 64).
*   **Specific Device:** The `DeviceN` device is mentioned as one of the few that can trigger this, and the problem is further triggered if the `MaxBitmap` figure is high enough (or the resolution is low enough).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious document to a vulnerable Ghostscript instance. This typically means the attacker must either control or have the ability to provide input to an application using Ghostscript.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was found during fuzzing.
*   The fix involves adding an `init_device_procs` entry for `mem_x_device`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when allocating a buffer device and using `mem_x_device` which is used as a prototype when the bpp > 64, and this device is missing the initialization routine.
*  The `DeviceN` device is particularly susceptible if its `MaxBitmap` is high enough or the resolution is low enough.
