- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Unyson plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or modifying page content.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `extension` parameter, an attacker can inject client-side scripts that will be executed when a victim user opens the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a specific URL. No special permissions are needed, and the attack can be performed remotely. The user would need to be tricked into clicking the crafted link.
