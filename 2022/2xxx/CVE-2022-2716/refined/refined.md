    ## Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder <= 2.5.5.2 – Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Text Editor
    ...
    **CVE ID:**  [CVE-2022-2716](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-2716)
    ...
     **Researcher/s:** Zhouyuan Yang

    **Fully Patched Version:** 2.5.5.3
    ...
    The Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘Text Editor’ block in versions up to, and including, 2.5.5.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with access to the Beaver Builder editor to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    ```

This confirms that the analyzed content **is directly related to CVE-2022-2716**, specifically highlighting the fix in version 2.5.5.3 and outlining the vulnerability.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Text Editor block of the Beaver Builder plugin.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript or HTML code injected by an attacker is stored in the database and executed in the browsers of other users accessing the affected page.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker with access to the Beaver Builder editor can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in the browser of any user accessing the page. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing website content
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered via the `Text Editor` block within the Beaver Builder plugin.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the Beaver Builder editor. Contributor or above access level will typically allow the user to access the editor, though this can be restricted on a per-role basis.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version **2.5.5.3** of the Beaver Builder plugin.
*   The vulnerability is a **Stored XSS**. This means the malicious code is saved to the database and served to any user accessing the affected page.
*  The security fix was to sanitize the output of the text editor field.

**4. Summary of Relevant Technical Details:**

The core issue revolves around a lack of sanitization in the handling of user-provided content within the `Text Editor` block of the Beaver Builder plugin. This allows an attacker, who has the ability to edit content with the page builder, to inject malicious JavaScript code, resulting in a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

The fix involves sanitizing user inputs that are used in HTML attributes.

**5. Relationship to other changes in the changelogs:**

The changelogs also include fixes for other XSS vulnerabilities in the Button & Button Group Modules when using lightbox (2.8.0.7), Authenticated(Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via module container elements (2.8.0.4), XSS issue via form fields with preview text (2.8.3.7), and XSS issue via type parameter on repeater fields (2.8.3.6). This indicates that the development team was actively addressing a range of XSS vulnerabilities.
