    "related": true,
    "information": "The provided content includes information about CVE-2022-2344.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `ins_compl_add()` function within `insexpand.c`. This occurs when handling completion matches with duplicate entries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe core issue is an out-of-bounds read due to missing string length check in the `ins_compl_add` function which is triggered during duplicate match handling in the completion process.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nExploitation could result in a heap-based buffer overflow. The impact includes potential for denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution although not explicitly stated. The Gentoo advisory mentions 'denial of service' as the worst-case scenario.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector involves crafting input that triggers the vulnerable code path during completion. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when a duplicate match is encountered during completion of user input.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker would need to be able to provide input to Vim, triggering a completion process that results in duplicate completion matches. This is likely achievable by a local user or by providing a crafted file."
