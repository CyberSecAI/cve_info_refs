Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `lab.php` file of the Library Management System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `Section` parameter in the `/admin/lab.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection. User-supplied input is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data extraction:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. The provided PoC demonstrates this by using `UNION ALL SELECT` to concatenate data into a single field. This includes the ability to read arbitrary database data, potentially including usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** The attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to further attacks and system compromises.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `/admin/lab.php`. The vulnerable parameter `Section` is submitted in the request body using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads for the `Section` parameter.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server, either by using command-line tools such as `curl`, or more specialized software such as Burp Suite or other web proxies.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided information includes a sample POST request that exploits the vulnerability, including the malicious SQL payload.
*   The attacker uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to inject a crafted SQL query and extract data. The `0x71716b7171` strings are probably used to define where the data being extracted is located within the extracted data field.
*   The content also refers to a SQL injection vulnerability in `/index.php` related to parameter `RollNo` (CVE-2022-2492).
