Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-2437:

**CVE-2022-2437:**

*   **Vulnerable Software:** Feed Them Social â€“ for Twitter feed, Youtube and more plugin for WordPress, versions up to and including 2.9.8.5.
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted input via the 'fts_url' parameter. The plugin is not sanitizing the 'fts_url' parameter, allowing an attacker to call files using a PHAR wrapper and deserialize the data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Unauthenticated PHAR Deserialization. The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the fts_url parameter which facilitates the deserialization of untrusted data
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** This allows unauthenticated attackers to call files using a PHAR wrapper, deserialize the data, and call arbitrary PHP objects, which, if a POP chain is present, can lead to various malicious actions, potentially gaining remote code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a request with a malicious 'fts_url' parameter that includes a PHAR wrapper.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Unauthenticated access to the WordPress site.
    *   Ability to upload a file containing a serialized payload to the server (this may be achieved through another vulnerability)
    *   Requires a POP chain to be present in the vulnerable application.
*   **Additional Details**
    * The exploit involves calling a file using a PHAR wrapper which deserializes the data and calls arbitrary PHP objects.
    * The attacker needs to successfully upload a file with the serialized payload to exploit this vulnerability, this is a separate step from exploiting the deserialization.
    * The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.
*   **Patch Information**:
    *   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.8.6.
    *   The fix included sanitizing the fts_url parameter, using `esc_url_raw()`.
    *   The fix also include sanitizing the `fts_no_video_image` and `fts_popup` parameters using `esc_html()`
