- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Inspiro Premium theme fails to sanitize the portfolio slider description.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the portfolio slider description. This code will execute when a user views the affected page, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with Contributor or higher privileges can inject the malicious code through the portfolio item's slider description.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor privileges in WordPress.
