# Release titles visible for any users if group milestones are associated with any project releases

**[HackerOne report #1012659](https://hackerone.com/reports/1012659)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2020-10-20, assigned to [@ankelly](/ankelly "Andrew Kelly"):

[Report](#report)

## Report

##### Summary

Hello,

Looks like this issue appeared because of `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235391`

When public group milestones are associated with private project releases, the release titles are visible for any user (non members)

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a public group and milestone in a group. **note this group must have gold tier subscription**
2. Create a private project and release within it.
3. Associate group milestone with private project release with below API

```
curl --header &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; --request PUT --data &#39;{&#34;name&#34;: &#34;RELEASE FROM PROJECT&#34;, &#34;milestones&#34;: [&#34;GroupMilestone1&#34;]}&#39; --header &#34;PRIVATE-TOKEN: &lt;Token&gt;&#34; &#34;https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/&lt;ID&gt;/releases/&lt;Name&gt;&#34;
```

4. Now login as any user and access the public group milestone page `https://gitlab.com/groups/&lt;PublicGroup&gt;/-/milestones` and you should see the name of the release with milestone name. This release actually belongs to private project which you cant see or have access!

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Release titles visible in public group if the releases are associated with public group milestones!

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Release titles shouldnt be visible when they belong to private project!

##### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

Regards,

Ashish

#### Impact

Release titles visible for any users if public group milestones are associated with any private project releases
