  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The theme and some of its required plugins do not escape a parameter before outputting it back in attributes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page. When a user interacts with this manipulated page, the injected script is executed in their browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the `q` parameter, an attacker can inject JavaScript code that is executed when a user hovers over the search field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a specific URL containing the malicious payload. The user needs to visit the crafted link and hover over the search field to trigger the XSS."
