Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2936:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from Wordfence explicitly mentions "Image Hover Effects Ultimate <= 9.7.3 â€“ Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Video Link" and directly assigns it the CVE ID CVE-2022-2936. This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Image Hover Effects Ultimate plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize and escape Video Link values when they are processed and displayed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious scripts injected into the Video Link field are permanently stored in the database and executed whenever a user accesses a page with an affected image hover effect.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when viewing pages where affected image hover effects are present.
*  **Potentially Steal Sensitive Information**: This allows attackers to execute any malicious actions they desire, including but not limited to redirecting users, stealing sensitive information, or modifying the content of the page.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Injection:** An authenticated user (typically an administrator, but potentially lower-privileged users depending on plugin settings) with access to modify image hover effects can directly inject malicious scripts into the "Video Link" field.
*   **Page Load:** The XSS payload executes when a user views a page where a vulnerable image hover is rendered.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to WordPress with the ability to modify image hover effects. By default, this is typically an administrator level permission, but the plugin settings can be changed to allow lower privileged users to edit the image hover effects.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to know that the Video Link field was vulnerable to cross-site scripting and how to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided information from Wordfence offers more details compared to a basic CVE description. It clarifies that the vulnerability stems from input sanitization and output escaping issues, as well as specifically stating how malicious code can be injected via the Video Link value.
