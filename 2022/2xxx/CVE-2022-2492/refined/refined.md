The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Library Management System with QR code Attendance and Auto Generate Library Card, specifically within the `index.php` file and related to `CVE-2022-2492`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `RollNo` parameter within the `index.php` file, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates the user-supplied `RollNo` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to potentially:
  - Bypass authentication (as demonstrated in the example by injecting a sleep command and bypassing login with `admin' AND (SELECT 2625 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))MdIL) AND 'KXmq'='KXmq`).
  - Read or modify sensitive database information.
  - Potentially gain full control over the database and underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/index.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `RollNo`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No authentication is required to send the crafted requests.

**Additional Details**
- The provided content includes a sample HTTP request demonstrating the SQL injection vulnerability using a sleep command, along with a description of the vulnerable parameter.
- The content also links to a github image containing sqlmap results.
