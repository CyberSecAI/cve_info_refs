- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape some of its settings, specifically the "Custom More Tag Content" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When the injected code is rendered in a user's browser, it will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or modifying website content.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have administrative access to the WordPress plugin settings. They inject the malicious payload into the "Custom More Tag Content" field within the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator or similar high privilege access to the WordPress site. They also need the ability to modify plugin settings.
