- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Cloudflare WARP Client for Windows used an unquoted service path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted service path (CWE-428)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious executable can be placed in a directory within the unquoted path and executed when the service is started or restarted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to have write access to a directory in the unquoted service path.
