## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP phpMyAdmin < 5.2.0.4 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "phpMyAdmin on hosting" settings (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-phpmyadmin-extension) of the plugin: "autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/)//
