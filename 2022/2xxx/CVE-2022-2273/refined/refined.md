{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not properly validate the `membership_level` parameter when editing a profile.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Membership privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input during profile updates.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Members can escalate to a higher membership level by manipulating the `membership_level` parameter in a POST request.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted POST request to the `/membership-login/membership-profile/` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with an existing membership."
