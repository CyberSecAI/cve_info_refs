Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2343:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in the `ins_compl_add()` function within `insexpand.c`. Specifically, it occurs during the infercase completion process when a long line is used with the 'infercase' setting enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow:  The `ins_compl_add()` function, when combined with `ins_compl_infercase_gettext` does not properly handle long input strings, leading to writing beyond allocated buffer in heap memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service. Other impacts may be possible but aren't explicitly stated in the provided context.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using the insert mode completion with `CTRL-X CTRL-L` with a long line in a vim buffer with the `infercase` option enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to edit a file using vim or gvim and insert a very long line.

**Additional details:**
- The `ins_compl_infercase_gettext` function was attempting to allocate a buffer in IObuff to generate an output, however, in case of long lines, it would switch to a grow array only when getting six bytes from the end of IObuff, potentially overflowing the buffer.
- The fix involves switching to grow array from the start if needed and properly handling memory allocation for the completed text.
- The vulnerability is present in vim versions prior to 9.0.0060 and 9.0.1157.
- Patch 9.0.0045, addresses this issue by allocating the string if needed and avoiding writing beyond buffer limits in `ins_compl_infercase_gettext`.
