- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cloudflare WARP client for Windows allowed the creation of mount points from its ProgramData folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation (CWE-20) and improper link resolution before file access (CWE-59). Specifically, the software does not properly validate the paths used during mount point creation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation and arbitrary file overwrite of SYSTEM protected files. An attacker could potentially gain SYSTEM privileges and overwrite critical system files.
- **Attack vectors:** During the installation process of the WARP client, an attacker can exploit the mount point creation to escalate privileges and overwrite arbitrary files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to influence the installation process of the WARP client. This likely means the attacker would need to have some control over the machine or be able to execute code during the installation.
