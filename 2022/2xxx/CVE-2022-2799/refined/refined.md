- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Affiliates Manager plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-provided settings, such as the "Currency Symbol", "Minimum Payout Amount", and "Email Name".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization and output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings. This malicious script will then be executed in the browsers of other users who access these settings or related functionalities, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, where a high-privilege user can insert malicious JavaScript code in vulnerable input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have administrative privileges (Admin+) to access and modify the plugin settings.
