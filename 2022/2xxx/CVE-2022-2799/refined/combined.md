## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Affiliates Manager < 2.9.14 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Currency Symbol" settings of the plugin and save: "><svg/onload=prompt(/XSS/)>
Other settings are affected (such as Minimum Payout Amount, Email Name etc)
