The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2535.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the plugin not restricting live search queries to published posts only, allowing access to private, draft, and pending post titles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- Broken Access Control
- Lack of proper authorization checks when processing search queries

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can disclose the titles and permalinks of private, draft, and pending posts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `searchwp_live_search` and the `post_status` parameter set to `draft`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
