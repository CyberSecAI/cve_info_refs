- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape parameters before using them in SQL statements via AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the database, modify data, or even gain control over the system. In this case, the provided CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality with no impact on integrity or availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `user_id` parameter of the `get-achievements` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user (e.g., a subscriber) to exploit this vulnerability.
