- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-provided settings, specifically the "After Register Redirect URL" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will be executed when a user accesses the affected page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject the malicious payload directly into the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress instance.
