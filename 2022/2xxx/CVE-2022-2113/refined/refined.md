```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code was vulnerable to CSV injection, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious formulas into exported CSV files. Additionally, the application was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via user-supplied HTML content in table cells and form data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CSV injection",
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious formulas into CSV files, or execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser by injecting HTML content in table cells or form data. This could potentially lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Injecting malicious formula strings into data exported to CSV files",
    "Injecting malicious HTML content into table cells and form data"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious strings/html into the data that will be exported to CSV or displayed in tables/forms, or they would need access to a data source that could be used to do this."
