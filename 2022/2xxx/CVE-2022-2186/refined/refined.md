- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings. Specifically, the "Notes placeholder" setting allows the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious code through the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the WordPress site. They must be able to access the plugin settings page.
