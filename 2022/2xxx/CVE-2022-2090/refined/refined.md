- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied input before outputting it in the `name` parameter on the discount rule page. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or the redirection of the victim to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via a crafted URL that injects malicious javascript code into the `name` parameter of the plugin's discount rule page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link to the vulnerable page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the attack.
