- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has an AJAX action that allows high privilege users to perform a POST request on behalf of the server to an arbitrary URL, without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with admin privileges can make the server perform requests to internal network/LAN addresses, potentially scanning internal network or interacting with internal services. The response from the server is also appended to the response, thus enabling the attacker to obtain information about the targeted internal service.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `mailchimp_woocommerce_oauth_status` action and a malicious URL in the `url` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges on the WordPress site.
