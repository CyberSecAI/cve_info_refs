The provided content includes a list of CVEs associated with Pandora FMS, including CVE-2022-2059.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2059 (The provided text incorrectly states it as CVE-2022-26310)

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Location:** Agent Manager

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling agent management, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed when other users access the Agent Manager.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they access the Agent Manager. This could lead to:

*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the web page
*   Credential theft
*   Redirection to malicious sites
*   Other client-side attacks

**Attack vector:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the Agent Manager functionality. The stored XSS is triggered when a victim views the affected page in the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Agent Manager to insert malicious code. It is not explicitly stated if the attacker needs to be authenticated, but most likely they would require at least some level of user access in the application.

**Fixed in version:** 762
