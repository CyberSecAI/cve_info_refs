- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WSM Downloader plugin lacks proper validation of the "link" parameter, allowing attackers to bypass domain restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation, specifically on the "link" parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass the intended domain restrictions and download files from arbitrary locations.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to `/blog/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a manipulated "link" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the target server. They do not need to be authenticated users.
