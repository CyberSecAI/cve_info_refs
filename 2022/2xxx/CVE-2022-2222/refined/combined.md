## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Download Monitor < 4.5.91 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Download

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that files to be downloaded are inside the blog folders, and not sensitive, allowing high privilege users such as admin to download the wp-config.php or /etc/passwd even in an hardened environment or multisite setup.

### Proof of Concept

Create a new download, add a file and put the following payload in the File URLs: /var/www/html/wp-config.php or /etc/passwd
Publish the download and download the file
