```
{
  "Root cause": "The `deployKeyRowHtml` function in `access_dropdown.js` does not sanitize the deployment key title, which is user-controlled, before rendering it in the dropdown menu. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Lack of input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to perform arbitrary malicious requests on behalf of victims on the HTTP client side. This includes actions such as making API requests to access private resources.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker injects malicious HTML (e.g., `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) into the deployment key title. This payload is then rendered within a dropdown menu in the project settings page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit a deployment key within a project, which usually means having at least maintainer access to the project. A victim needs to be a maintainer of the project to be targeted."
