```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Name' parameter on the profile edit page before storing it in the database, resulting in stored cross-site scripting.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could steal cookies by injecting malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/LMS/admin/edit_admin_details.php` endpoint containing a malicious JavaScript payload in the 'Name' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the affected endpoint, which can be done remotely. No specific authentication is explicitly required in the provided POC, although the page itself might require prior authentication as an admin."
