Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper session validation and authorization checks on the administrative dashboard pages of the Company Website CMS. Although the `header.php` redirects to login page when the username session is not set, the administrative pages themselves (e.g. `site-settings.php`) lack individual checks for user authentication/session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication Checks:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the CMS dashboard pages do not verify if the user has an active session before allowing them to perform actions.
*   **Reliance on Initial Session Setup:** The system seems to rely only on the session check on `header.php` , and assumes that once a user logs in, their session will be valid for all subsequent actions, however individual dashboard pages do not verify the session.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:**  The site settings and other administrative functions are directly accessible without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Admin Panel:** An attacker can bypass the login mechanism by simply deleting cookies after logging in once and still be able to access and modify the administrative pages.
*   **Full Control over the Website:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform any administrative actions, including modifying the site settings, publishing articles, uploading files, and deleting information. This can lead to complete compromise of the website.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify website content, leading to defacement or misinformation dissemination.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The ability to upload files could be exploited to host and distribute malicious software to website visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** An attacker can directly access the administrative pages (e.g. `/dashboard/site-settings.php`) without authentication after deleting cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Login:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the `/dashboard` at least once to establish an initial session.
*   **Knowledge of Admin Panel Location:** The attacker needs to know the paths to the administrative pages.
*   **Ability to Modify Cookies:** The attacker needs the ability to delete browser cookies to demonstrate that the vulnerability exists after logging in.

**Additional details:**

*   The code examples provided in the report show the lack of authorization checks in `site-settings.php` and highlight that `header.php` only does the initial login check and that subsequent pages do not ensure session validity.
*   The report demonstrates the exploitation of this issue by modifying site settings, deleting cookies and then modifying them again while still logged in.
*   The source code analysis shows that `index.php` just outputs username, and that `header.php` only redirects to login page if no session exists, but does not secure subsequent pages.
