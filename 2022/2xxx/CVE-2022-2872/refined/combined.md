üîíÔ∏è Enforce valid type on copy/move of uploads

```
Also enforce that on downloads and mirror it on the
API.

Prevents accidental or intentional renaming of
valid files to something like .html to e.g. attempt
to run arbitrary JS code in the browser on
"download" in the context of the OctoPrint URL.
Stealing login credentials via XSS is very unlikely
here given their http-only nature, however it's
still better to prevent this from happening anyhow.
