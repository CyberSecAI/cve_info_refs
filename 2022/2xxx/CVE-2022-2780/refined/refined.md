- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Git connection checker in affected versions of Octopus Server initiates an SMB request when testing Git connectivity for VCS projects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the Git connectivity test function triggering an SMB request, which can be intercepted and used in an NTLM relay attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to potentially perform an NTLM relay attack, which could lead to unauthorized access or actions within the network.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to be on the same network or have the ability to intercept network traffic generated by the Octopus Server. Then by utilizing the Git connectivity test functionality, the attacker can trigger the SMB request and conduct an NTLM relay attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept or relay network traffic originating from the Octopus Server and have some control over the target SMB server.
