- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPQA plugin does not perform authorization checks before displaying private messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. The plugin fails to verify if the logged-in user has the authorization to access the private message specified by the `message_id`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Any logged-in user can read private messages of other users by knowing or brute-forcing the `message_id`. This leads to a private message disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Attacker sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=wpqa_message_reply` and a `message_id` parameter.
    - The attacker needs to have a valid cookie for any logged-in user (Subscriber+ role).
    - The `message_id` can be brute-forced.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Must have a valid user account (Subscriber+ role).
    - Must be able to send HTTP POST requests.
    - The attacker must know or be able to guess/brute-force the `message_id`.
