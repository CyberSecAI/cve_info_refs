Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-2461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin allows unauthorized setting changes due to insufficient permissions checking on the 'tp\_translation' AJAX action. This is compounded by default settings which are too permissive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly validate user permissions before allowing changes to plugin settings through the 'tp\_translation' AJAX action.
*   **Insecure Defaults:** The default configuration allows unauthenticated users to modify plugin settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Settings Modification**: Unauthenticated attackers can alter plugin settings, which can influence the data displayed on the site. This could be used to deface the site, inject malicious content, or redirect users.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** By injecting malicious content or scripts into the settings, attackers can escalate to more severe attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifying the `tp_translation` action and a desired translation. The attacker crafts the POST request without any authentication or authorization controls.
*   **Unauthenticated access**: The 'tp_translation' AJAX action does not check for authentication

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers do not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers only require network connectivity to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Wordfence article mentions that this vulnerability is due to a lack of permissions checking.
*   The GitHub advisory from MrTuxracer provides a clear proof-of-concept POST request, illustrating how to add a new translation through the vulnerable AJAX action.
* The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download.

This information provides more detail than the basic CVE description by highlighting the vulnerable AJAX action (`tp_translation`), describing the insecure defaults, and clarifying how an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
