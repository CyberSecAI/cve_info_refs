This document provides information on multiple vulnerabilities, but focuses on CVE-2022-2107, which is present in the MiCODUS MV720 GPS tracker.

**CVE-2022-2107:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use of hard-coded credentials in the API server's authentication mechanism
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The API server allows devices to use a hard-coded master password.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can send SMS commands directly to the GPS tracker, as if they were coming from the GPS ownerâ€™s mobile number, potentially gaining access to location, routes, fuel cutoff commands, and disarming various features.
*  **Attack vectors:** Sending SMS commands directly to the GPS tracker, exploiting the hardcoded password
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the hard-coded password, and can interact with the tracker remotely.

The document also mentions other vulnerabilities related to the same device:

*   **CVE-2022-2141**: Improper authentication; SMS-based GPS commands can be executed without authentication.
*   **CVE-2022-2199**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability; the main web server has a reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   **CVE-2022-34150 & CVE-2022-33944**: Authorization bypass through user-controlled key;  insecure direct object reference vulnerabilities on device IDs.

The document also provides mitigation steps, recommending that users update the web tracking platform, Android app, and iOS app to the latest versions.
