- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Opt-in WordPress plugin versions 1.4.1 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to modify plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify plugin settings, including email sending configurations, potentially leading to spam emails being sent through the compromised website, and injecting malicious content via crafted HTML in various fields such as success messages and form elements. Redirects to malicious external sites are possible as well.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTML form submitted by a victim. The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into submitting a crafted form, exploiting the lack of CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a malicious form. This could be achieved through social engineering or by hosting a malicious page on a site where a logged-in victim is likely to visit.
