{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Stack buffer overflow in the `spell_dump_compl()` function within `spell.c`. The function failed to properly limit the length of a word being processed, potentially leading to an overflow when handling very long words.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A stack buffer overflow can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability could be triggered if Vim processes a crafted spell file containing overly long words, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious spell file or a text file with extremely long words when spell checking is enabled",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to load a specially crafted file that triggers the vulnerable code path. This could involve opening a text file or a spell file with malicious content."

  "affected_software": {
    "name": "Vim",
    "versions": [
      "Versions prior to 9.0.0035 are vulnerable",
        "Fixed in 9.0.049 (Fedora 35 & 36)",
         "Fixed in 9.0.0060 (Gentoo)",
          "Fixed in 9.0.1157 (Gentoo)"
    ]
  },
    "additional_notes": [
        "The fix involves limiting the word length in the `spell_dump_compl()` function. This prevents the function from writing beyond the bounds of the stack allocated buffer.",
        "Multiple vendors have released security updates addressing this vulnerability"
