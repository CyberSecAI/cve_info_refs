## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Export All URLs < 4.4 - Admin+ Arbitrary System File Removal

### Description

The plugin does not validate the path of the file to be removed on the system which is supposed to be the CSV file. This could allow high privilege users to delete arbitrary file from the server

### Proof of Concept

# File to remove: /var/www/vhosts/target/httpdocs/blog/wp-content/uploads/test
# Base64 the full path: L3Zhci93d3cvdmhvc3RzL3RhcmdldC9odHRwZG9jcy9ibG9nL3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy90ZXN0
