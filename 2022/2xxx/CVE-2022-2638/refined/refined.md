Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause:** The Export All URLs plugin fails to validate the path of the file to be removed. It is intended to remove a CSV file, but the plugin doesn't verify if the provided path points to a CSV file or something else.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Arbitrary File Deletion vulnerability due to lack of input validation of the file path to be removed.
* **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to data loss, website malfunction, or further system compromise.
* **Attack vectors:**  An attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or another high privilege user and send a crafted request to the `tools.php` page with the file path to delete in the 'f' parameter of the GET request.  The path must be base64 encoded.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative or other high privilege access to the WordPress admin panel.
