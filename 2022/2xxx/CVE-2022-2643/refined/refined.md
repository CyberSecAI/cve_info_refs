Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-2643, though the CVE description is a placeholder:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities in the "Student-Admission CMS" application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in at least two locations:
    *   **Location 1:** The `shift` POST parameter is vulnerable, as shown by the sqlmap output. This allows for both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection.
    *   **Location 2:** The `eid` GET parameter is vulnerable to multiple forms of SQL injection including boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query injection.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability arises because the application fails to sanitize user inputs before including them in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Leakage:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data within the database. This could include user information, application data, and potentially other confidential information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Potential for System Compromise:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can lead to further exploitation or system compromise, depending on the database permissions and configurations.
*  **Denial of Service:** Through time-based blind SQL injection, an attacker can cause delays by sending multiple sleep commands to the database, resulting in a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The `shift` parameter is vulnerable through POST requests.
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The `eid` parameter is vulnerable through GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP POST and GET requests to target the vulnerable parameters.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker must understand SQL injection techniques to exploit the vulnerability effectively, tools like sqlmap can also be used.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content is from a public GitHub repository.
*   The exploit was demonstrated using `sqlmap`, which confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The provided screenshots of the sqlmap output give detailed payload information for both vulnerable locations.
* The SQL injection in location 1 can be performed through a POST request that involves multiple parameters while the SQL injection in location 2 can be performed through a GET request using the eid parameter.
* The repository provides a link to download the vulnerable source code.
