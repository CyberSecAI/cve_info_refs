{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to set special properties like `__proto__` when creating a schema with dot-notation via the `add()` or constructor methods.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially modify the prototype of objects, leading to unexpected behavior, denial-of-service, or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload containing special properties within the schema definition when using dot-notation, through `add()` or constructor methods of mongoose schema"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to define or influence the schema definition, including providing input to the `add()` or schema constructor methods of Mongoose. This often involves controlling the data used for schema creation in an application."
