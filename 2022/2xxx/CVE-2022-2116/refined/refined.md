The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Elementor Contact Form DB" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions prior to 1.8.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape certain parameters before including them in HTML attributes. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could allow them to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with injected JavaScript within specific parameters (`form_id` and `form_name`).
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking the crafted URL, usually via phishing or social engineering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the required parameters.
- The attacker needs to persuade a logged-in administrator to access the crafted URL.
