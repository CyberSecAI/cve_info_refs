- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin accepts all zip files and automatically extracts them without validating the extracted file type.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload leading to remote code execution. Specifically, lack of validation on extracted file types from uploaded ZIP archives.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve remote code execution (RCE) by uploading a malicious PHP file (or similar executable) within a ZIP archive.
- **Attack vectors**: By uploading a ZIP file containing malicious code to the "New Import Upload" page of the plugin, which is accessible to admin users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin privileges in the WordPress installation.
