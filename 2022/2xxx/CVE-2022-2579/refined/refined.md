{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Garage Management System does not properly filter user-supplied input in the 'userName' parameter when creating a new user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when they view the affected user, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the 'createUser.php' endpoint with a malicious payload in the 'userName' parameter."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application, typically through a web browser or a tool like curl. They must also be able to create new users within the application, or be in a position to influence a user to create new users.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists within the user creation functionality, where the 'userName' field is not sanitized or encoded before being stored in the database. When a user views the user list, the stored payload is executed in their browser."
