| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c0)  Sandipan Roy    2022-08-11 08:10:56 UTC  ``` UndertowInputStream.close() blocks waiting to read -1  <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/UNDERTOW-2048>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c4)  Peter Palaga    2022-08-29 15:42:15 UTC  ``` @pjindal I see that this CVE is valid fro Undertow 2.x. I wonder whether it is also reproducible on quarkus-http which was developed on top of Undertow 2.x? Note that there is io.undertow.httpcore.UndertowInputStream class in quarkus-http.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c5)  Paramvir jindal    2022-08-30 05:44:54 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c4): > @pjindal I see that this CVE is valid fro Undertow 2.x. I wonder > whether it is also reproducible on quarkus-http which was developed on top > of Undertow 2.x? > Note that there is io.undertow.httpcore.UndertowInputStream class in > quarkus-http.  Peter, I have added you in <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/UNDERTOW-2048>, there is a comment on this jira on details about reproducing this issue. Also since quarkus-http is based on Undertow 2.x means quarkus ships the affected code and hence it should be marked as affected. I am still not sure if this can be reproduced in quarkus as it is not easy to reproduce.   Since this is already a Low impact CVE, I am marking quarkus as affected for this CVE so that we can fix the affected undertow code in quarkus 2.x.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c10)  James Howe    2022-09-13 09:46:44 UTC  ``` Is there a simple mitigation for this?  As far as I am aware, I don't use EJB invocations. Is there a setting to disable them, or are they not even configured by default?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-05 21:05:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2022:8792 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8792](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8792)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-05 21:06:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2022:8790 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8790](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8790)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-05 21:07:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:8791 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8791](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8791)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-05 21:10:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    EAP 7.4.8 release  Via RHSA-2022:8793 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8793](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8793)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2117506#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-12-09 17:02:24 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
