- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape specific parameters before outputting them in the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This can lead to various issues like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting a URL containing a malicious payload in the `GOTMLS_debug` or `eli` GET parameters, and tricking a user to click the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator to click a malicious link containing the crafted XSS payload.
