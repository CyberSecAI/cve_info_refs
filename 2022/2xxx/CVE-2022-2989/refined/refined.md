Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-2989:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of supplementary groups within container runtimes. Specifically, when a container is initialized, the user's primary group is not duplicated and added to the list of supplementary groups, unlike what occurs during a standard user login in Linux. This behavior is not explicitly defined in the Open Container Initiative Runtime Specification, leading to inconsistent implementations across container runtimes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect group initialization:** Container runtimes do not properly set up supplementary groups, omitting the user's primary group from this list.
- **Bypass of negative group permissions:** This behavior allows a process within the container to effectively "drop" its primary group.  If negative group permissions are used, where a group is explicitly denied access to a resource, a set-group program can exploit this to bypass intended restrictions and access the resource.
- **Set-group program exploitation**: An attacker with the ability to execute code inside the container can create a set-group program with its group set to one of the user's supplementary groups. This program will then run without the primary group in its list of groups, bypassing access controls based on the primary group's negative permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information that should have been protected by negative group permissions.
- **Data modification:** An attacker can modify data that should have been protected by negative group permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct container access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within the affected container.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have some level of access to the container. This could be achieved in various ways, such as compromising an application running within the container or having direct access to the container environment.
-  The targeted system must be using negative group permissions for access control, and the user within the container should have multiple supplementary groups.
- The attacker must be able to execute code within the container to create and run a set-group executable.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects various container runtimes including `runc`, `crun`, and `Kata Containers`, as well as higher-level tools such as Docker, Podman, Buildah, and cri-o.
- The vulnerability is not widely exploited due to the relatively uncommon use of negative group permissions.
-  Mitigations include:
    - Starting containers with "su -l"
    - Manually duplicating groups in /etc/group
    - Blocking setuid/setgid programs using Docker's --security-opt no-new-privileges or Kubernetes' allowPrivilegeEscalation=false setting.
    -  Identifying the use of negative group permissions using a scan tool.
- The specification of the Open Container Initiative is considered ambiguous, allowing different interpretations on group handling.
