- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view those settings. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by modifying the plugin's settings, specifically the "Client ID" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as admin access, to modify the plugin settings.
