The provided content relates to CVE-2022-2840.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Zephyr Project Manager plugin for WordPress fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities are present due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of parameters used in SQL statements. These vulnerabilities are exploitable via AJAX actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow attackers to manipulate the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service. The CVSS score is 9.3 (Critical), indicating high severity.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. Attackers send crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, using vulnerable `action` parameters such as `zpm_view_project` and `zpm_view_task` along with malicious SQL payloads in the `project_id` and `task_id` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability, they only need network access to the WordPress website.
