  "CVE-2022-2057": {
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate LibTIFF. LibTIFF version 4.4.0 is susceptible to vulnerabilities which when successfully exploited could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nDivide By Zero error in tiffcrop allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.\n\nThere is a FPE error in computeOutputPixelOffsets, tools/tiffcrop.c:5936. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.",
    "root_cause": "A divide-by-zero error occurs in the tiffcrop utility, specifically within the computeOutputPixelOffsets function, due to a crafted TIFF file. Additionally, improper conversion of double to uint32_t and lack of integer overflow checks.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Divide by zero error",
      "Floating point exception (FPE)",
       "Integer Overflow",
       "Improper conversion of double to uint32_t"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). Application crash",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted TIFF file",
      "Passing a crafted TIFF file to the tiffcrop tool"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted TIFF file to the vulnerable application or tool."
