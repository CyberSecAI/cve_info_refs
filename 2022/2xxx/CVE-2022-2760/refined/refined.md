- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application reveals the Space ID in error messages when a resource is part of another space, even if the user does not have access to view that space.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure, specifically the disclosure of Space IDs to unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can learn Space IDs of spaces they do not have permissions to access, potentially aiding in reconnaissance and further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By triggering error messages related to resources in other spaces, an attacker can extract the Space ID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a user of the Octopus Deploy application and be able to trigger the specific error messages.
