{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient access control checks when adding, editing or viewing amendments in OpenEMR. The code relies on ACL checks to determine if a user has the required permissions but introduces logic errors when dealing with multiple types of access (write, addonly). Specifically, the `onlyRead` variable is modified using multiple conditions, potentially leading to unintended access bypasses. In addition, the update functionality fails to enforce proper restrictions leading to potential unauthorized modification of patient data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient Access Control",
      "Logic Errors",
      "Improper Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass access controls and modify or create patient amendments without proper authorization. This could lead to data corruption, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, or other forms of malicious activity.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious user accessing the 'add_edit_amendments.php' script without having the required privileges and using this to add or edit sensitive amendment data.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be a valid user of the OpenEMR system, but without the necessary ACL permissions to add/edit patient amendments, or someone who has some kind of write access but not add access trying to add data.",
