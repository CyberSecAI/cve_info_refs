Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization of the `search` parameter in the Simple Parking Management System, which allows injection of malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application reflects the user-supplied input in the search parameter within the HTML response without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cookie Theft: An attacker can inject JavaScript code that steals the user's cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URL: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `search` parameter and tricks the user into accessing this URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious URL to the victim, such as through email, social engineering or other means.
- No specific privileges on the victim's account or on the system hosting the application are required beyond convincing the user to access the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the reflected XSS vulnerability using a specific payload (`"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`) within the `search` parameter.
- The affected software is the Simple Parking Management System version 1.0.
- The PoC shows that the vulnerability can be exploited by injecting arbitrary javascript within the search parameter.
