- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists when the commissioning software accesses a malicious webpage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive information leakage that can potentially be used to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing a malicious web page from the commissioning software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to host or have control over a malicious webpage and lure the user into accessing it through the vulnerable software. The user must interact with the malicious page for the vulnerability to be triggered.
