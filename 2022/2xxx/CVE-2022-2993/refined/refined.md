- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An error in the condition of the last if-statement in the `smp_check_keys` function within Zephyr's SMP implementation. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect logical operator used in the conditional statement, which incorrectly checks if all security requirements are unmet instead of if any are unmet.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect logical condition in key validation, leading to a bypass of security requirements for Bluetooth connections at security level 4 and higher.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could potentially bypass security requirements for Bluetooth connections at level 4 or higher, which could result in low confidentiality, low integrity, and high availability impact.

- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via Bluetooth.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range to exploit the vulnerability. No privileges or user interaction is required.
