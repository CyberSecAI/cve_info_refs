{
  "CVE-2022-2867": {
    "Description": "In libtiff's tiffcrop utility, a uint32_t underflow results in an out-of-bounds read and write in extractContigSamples8bits and extractContigSamplesShifted32bits of tiffcrop.c.",
    "Root cause": "Integer underflow when calculating offsets in the tiffcrop utility.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer underflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write",
    ],
    "Impact": "Crash (denial of service), and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Processing a crafted TIFF image using the tiffcrop utility"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted TIFF image to tiffcrop, potentially through tricking a user into processing it with specific parameters."
