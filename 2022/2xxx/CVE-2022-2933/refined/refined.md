- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `zeromk_options_page` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious web scripts via the `zeromk_user` and `zeromk_apikluc` parameters, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious activities when an administrator views the affected pages.
- **Attack vectors**: A forged request is crafted by the attacker and the administrator is tricked into executing the request, for example by clicking a link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action that triggers the forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
