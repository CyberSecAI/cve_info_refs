- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize, validate, and escape various parameters before using them in an SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The provided PoC demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection where the `SLEEP(5)` function is used.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the REST API endpoint `/fluent-support/v2/tickets` via the `order_by` parameter. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query in the `order_by` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or other high privileges in the WordPress instance in order to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker also needs a valid nonce to use the REST API.
