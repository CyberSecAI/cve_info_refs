- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The API allows users without proper team permissions to access and obtain team information, including member details, descriptions, and associated permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information exposure. An attacker could obtain sensitive information about teams and their members, potentially gaining insights into the organization's structure and access controls.
- **Attack vectors**: API requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user of the Octopus Server, but does not need specific team permissions.
