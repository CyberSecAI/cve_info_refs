## Company Website CMS Dashboard Exists Arbitrary File Upload

[Company Website CMS](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15517/company-website-cms-php.html) Released by SourceCodester Has Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability

Each file upload page in the background allows arbitrary file uploads. After the attacker enters the background, he can upload a webshell to control the server.

### Arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in the following access paths

```
/dashboard/createblog
/dashboard/createservice
/dashboard/createportfolio
/dashboard/createslide
/dashboard/newtestimony
/dashboard/logo

```

The following is the corresponding file path

```
/dashboard/add-blog.php
/dashboard/add-portfolio.php
/dashboard/add-service.php
/dashboard/add-slider.php
/dashboard/add-testimony.php
/dashboard/add-user.php
/dashboard/editblog.php
/dashboard/editport.php
/dashboard/editservice.php
/dashboard/edituser.php
/dashboard/section-title.php
/dashboard/site-settings.php
/dashboard/static-home.php
/dashboard/updatecontact.php
/dashboard/updatelogo.php

```

### Take `/dashboard/logo` as an example

```
http://xxxx/dashboard/logo

```
