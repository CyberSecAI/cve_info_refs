- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape user-provided settings, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize input in the "Destination > FTP Settings", which allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript into the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information (cookies, etc.)
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Modifying the content of the website
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have a high privilege user account, such as an administrator.
    - The `unfiltered_html` capability must be disallowed, which is common in multisite setups.
