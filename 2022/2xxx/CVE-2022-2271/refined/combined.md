## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Database Backup < 5.9 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in any of the Destination > FTP Settings: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the Destination settings again

### Affects Plugins
