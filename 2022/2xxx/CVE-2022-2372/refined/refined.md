- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The YaySMTP plugin does not properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically "From Email" and "From Name".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. This is especially concerning in multisite setups where the `unfiltered_html` capability might be disallowed.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting the XSS payload into the "From Email" or "From Name" plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges or similar high-level access to the WordPress admin panel to modify plugin settings.
