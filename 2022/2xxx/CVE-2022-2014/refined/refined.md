  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The commit introduces a change that disables the evaluation of stylesheets in `mxStylesheetCodec` by setting `allowEval` to `false`. This likely addresses a potential vulnerability related to the dynamic execution of code within stylesheets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Potentially unsafe dynamic code execution via stylesheet evaluation."
      ],
      "impact": "Disabling `allowEval` in `mxStylesheetCodec` mitigates the risk of arbitrary code execution through manipulated stylesheets. This prevents a potential attack vector where malicious CSS could be used to run harmful code.",
      "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted stylesheets that, if evaluated, could execute arbitrary code within the application.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious content into a location that would be processed as a stylesheet by the application."
    },
    {
     "root_cause": "The commit replaces the usage of jQuery 3.3.1 with jQuery 3.6.0 in the Trello integration. This update could potentially address vulnerabilities present in the older jQuery version.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Outdated jQuery library with known security vulnerabilities."
      ],
      "impact": "Updating to a newer version of jQuery reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the older version. This ensures better security for the application by using a more secure dependency.",
      "attack_vectors": "Exploiting known vulnerabilities in jQuery 3.3.1 through Trello integration if it wasn't updated.",
     "required_capabilities":"An attacker could potentially exploit known jQuery vulnerabilities via the Trello integration if the jQuery library wasn't updated."
    },
    {
     "root_cause": "The commit includes a change related to the handling of cell IDs during CSV import. This addresses a specific issue where the cell ID was not being correctly processed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of cell IDs during CSV import."
      ],
      "impact": "Correct handling of cell IDs ensures data consistency and integrity when importing from CSV files, resolving potential issues from incorrect imports.",
      "attack_vectors":"Incorrect handling of data during CSV import could cause errors or unexpected behaviour.",
      "required_capabilities":"An attacker could try to exploit incorrect cell IDs during CSV import."
    },
    {
     "root_cause":"The commit fixes an issue related to the `isNode` check and handling HTML in node names. This likely addresses a bug or potential vulnerability arising from how HTML content is processed within node names.",
     "weaknesses":[
        "Insecure handling of HTML in node names during an `isNode` check."
      ],
      "impact":"Correctly handling HTML in node names prevents unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities that may result from insecure or incorrect processing of HTML content in node names.",
      "attack_vectors":"An attacker could attempt to inject malicious HTML content in node names.",
      "required_capabilities":"The attacker would need to inject the malicious content into a node name."
    },
    {
        "root_cause":"The commit modifies the Content Security Policy (CSP) by removing `https://ajax.googleapis.com` from the `script-src` directive. This change strengthens the CSP by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by preventing scripts from loading from the removed domain.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Relaxed Content Security Policy (CSP) by including `https://ajax.googleapis.com` as a script source"
        ],
        "impact":"By removing `https://ajax.googleapis.com` from `script-src`, the application reduces its attack surface by preventing the loading of scripts from an unnecessary domain. This strengthens the protection against XSS attacks by limiting potential injection points.",
        "attack_vectors":"An attacker might inject malicious content and load it from `https://ajax.googleapis.com` if the domain was included in the CSP.",
        "required_capabilities":"An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious content to a page where it is interpreted as HTML."
