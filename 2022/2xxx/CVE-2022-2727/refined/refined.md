The provided content describes SQL injection vulnerabilities in a Gym Management System project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection in the admin login page (`/mygym/admin/login.php`) via POST parameters `admin_email` and `admin_pass`.
- SQL injection in the `/mygym/admin/index.php?edit_tran` page via GET parameter `edit_tran`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can obtain database information (e.g., usernames, passwords, other sensitive data).
- Attackers can modify the database content (e.g., changing user details, adding/removing records).
- Complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted POST requests to the admin login page with SQL injection payloads in the `admin_email` or `admin_pass` fields.
- Sending crafted GET requests to the `/mygym/admin/index.php` endpoint with SQL injection payloads in the `edit_tran` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special position in the network is mentioned as being required.
