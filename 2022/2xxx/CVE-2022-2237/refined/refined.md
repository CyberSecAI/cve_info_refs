Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `checkSSO` function in the Keycloak Node.js Adapter. This function uses the `prompt=none` query parameter when forwarding requests to Keycloak.

**Weakness:**
The use of `prompt=none` allows authentication without user interaction, given the user is already authenticated with Keycloak. This can be leveraged to create an open redirect vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this to redirect a user to a malicious website after they are authenticated without their awareness.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker can craft a malicious URL that leverages the vulnerable `checkSSO` function and the `prompt=none` parameter to redirect the user to an attacker-controlled domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
The attacker needs to craft a specific URL that exploits the open redirect vulnerability in the `checkSSO` function of the Keycloak Node.js Adapter. The attacker would require knowledge of the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the Keycloak Node.js Adapter.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a specific use of the `prompt=none` parameter during the `checkSSO` function.
*   A fix is available in `Red Hat Single Sign-On` via `RHSA-2023:1049`.
