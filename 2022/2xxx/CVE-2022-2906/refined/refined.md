Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2906:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Memory leaks occur in the code handling Diffie-Hellman key exchange via TKEY RRs. This issue is specifically present when using OpenSSL version 3.0.0 or higher.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leaks when performing Diffie-Hellman key exchange via TKEY RRs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leaks could lead to resource exhaustion and potentially cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of Diffie-Hellman key exchanges via TKEY resource records. An attacker would likely need to send specially crafted DNS requests to exploit this.
