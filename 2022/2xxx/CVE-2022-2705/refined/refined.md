- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `manage_department.php` script directly uses the `id` GET parameter in a SQL query without sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete server compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessed through the `id` GET parameter in the `manage_department.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
