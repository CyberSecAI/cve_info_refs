The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in Wavlink devices, specifically the `nightled.cgi` script.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `nightled.cgi` script improperly handles user-supplied input, specifically the `start_hour` parameter. It allows command injection by inserting shell commands directly into the parameter value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability in `nightled.cgi` script

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain server privileges by injecting arbitrary shell commands. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/nightled.cgi` with the vulnerable parameter `start_hour`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device. The vulnerability is described as being accessible via an "unlimited front desk," which implies no authentication may be necessary.
