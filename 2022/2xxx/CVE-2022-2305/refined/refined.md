Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Popup plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
* **Impact of exploitation:** A high-privilege user, such as an admin, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page. This could lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. The impact is described as "low" due to the required privilege level.
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically the "Affiliate link text" field. An attacker with admin privileges can insert a malicious payload into this field.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with high privileges (e.g., an administrator) within the WordPress instance and have the `unfiltered_html` capability disallowed. The `unfiltered_html` capability is typically disallowed in multisite setups, making those environments more susceptible.

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof of concept demonstrates the vulnerability:
1. Navigate to the plugin's settings page: `http://target.tld/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=spucpt&page=spu_settings`
2. Inject the payload `"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>` into the "Affiliate link text" field.
This injected script will execute when the affected page is viewed by other users.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) and OWASP A7 (Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)). The CVSS score is 3.4, which is considered low, due to the need for high privileges and user interaction in the form of browsing the affected page.
