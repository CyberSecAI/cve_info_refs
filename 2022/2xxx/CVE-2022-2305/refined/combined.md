## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress Popup <= 1.9.3.8 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

On http://target.tld/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=spucpt&page=spu\_settings
Add the payload "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script> on the Affiliate link text field
