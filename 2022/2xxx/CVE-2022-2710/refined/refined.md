Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-2710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Scroll To Top" fails to properly escape or sanitize user-provided settings, specifically within the "Text" field. This lack of sanitization allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient output escaping/sanitization of user-supplied input within plugin settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the plugin's settings.
- When an administrator accesses the plugin settings page, the injected script will be executed in the administrator's browser session. This can potentially lead to:
    - Account compromise through session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting the administrator to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities depending on the injected JavaScript

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker, with admin or higher privileges (High privilege users), needs to access the plugin settings page.
- The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Text" settings field.
- The payload is stored in the database.
- When the plugin settings page is accessed again the stored JavaScript executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with administrative privileges or a similar high-level role that allows modifying plugin settings.
- Access to the WordPress admin dashboard.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Scroll To Top" plugin prior to 1.4.1.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses the payload: "autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/)//" demonstrating the execution of JavaScript code.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, which is often the case in multi-site WordPress setups, making this a particularly important finding.
