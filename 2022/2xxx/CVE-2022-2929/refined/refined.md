Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-2929:

**Root Cause:**

*   The DHCP server is prone to a memory leak when handling the contents of option 81 (FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name) data received in a DHCP packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak caused by improper handling of option 81 data within the DHCP server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the DHCP server to consume excessive resources due to the memory leak. This leads to a denial of service, potentially rendering the DHCP server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending malicious DHCP packets containing specifically crafted option 81 data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send DHCP packets to the vulnerable DHCP server. This generally implies network access to the segment where the DHCP server is running.

**Summary of CVE-2022-2929:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak within the DHCP server when processing option 81 (FQDN) data in DHCP packets. A remote attacker can send specially crafted DHCP packets with malicious option 81 data to trigger the memory leak. Repeated exploitation can lead to resource exhaustion on the DHCP server, resulting in denial of service.
