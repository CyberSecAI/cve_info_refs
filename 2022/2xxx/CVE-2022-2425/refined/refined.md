- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A high privilege user, such as an administrator, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. This script will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected page, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of those users, steal cookies, or redirect them to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, who can modify the plugin settings. The malicious payload is placed in a settings field accepting a string value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have admin-level or similar privileges to access and modify the plugin settings. The `unfiltered_html` capability needs to be disallowed for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
