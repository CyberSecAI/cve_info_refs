The provided content relates to CVE-2022-2167.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Newspaper theme fails to sanitize a parameter (`acts.td_atts.image_size`) before outputting it within an HTML attribute via an AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter, which will be executed in the victim's browser when the crafted request is processed. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, with the vulnerable parameter (`acts.td_atts.image_size`) containing the malicious payload. The payload is injected within the `atts` parameter as a JSON string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, making it exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker. The user would need to be tricked into submitting the malicious form.
