- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate that the files to be downloaded are within the intended blog folders.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file download. The plugin allows high privilege users to download arbitrary files, even sensitive ones, by manipulating the file URL.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can download sensitive files like `wp-config.php` or `/etc/passwd`, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific file URL using the `php://filter` wrapper.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a high-privilege user such as an admin. The attacker needs to be able to create a new download entry in the plugin and use the crafted URL in the "File URL(s)" field.
