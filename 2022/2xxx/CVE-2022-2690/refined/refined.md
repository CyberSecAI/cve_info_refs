The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2690, as it describes multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the Wedding Hall Booking System, which is the subject of the CVE (although the specific vulnerable code is not presented).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user input before displaying it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities, specifically in:
  - Contact Us page
  - Booking Form (when viewed by user and admin)
  - Profile page (when modified and viewed by the user)
  - Client Lists (when viewed by the admin)
  - Staff user profile (when viewed by the admin and when listing all users)

**Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) that will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
  - Stealing user and administrator cookies.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - Malicious input through form fields within different pages.
  - The provided URLs specify the vulnerable pages on the application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable forms.
   - An attacker needs to be able to lure users (including admins) to access pages with malicious code.
   - No privileged access is required to exploit the XSS, just the ability to interact with the vulnerable web application.
