The provided content is related to a commit that implements security enhancements in OctoPrint, specifically around session handling and cookie management. The commit addresses multiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses by implementing the following:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insecure session handling and cookie management

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of session invalidation on password change:** Existing user sessions were not invalidated when a user's password was changed, allowing continued access using old credentials.
- **Long-lived remember-me cookies:** The "remember me" cookies had a validity of one year, which could be misused if stolen, and not invalidated on password change.
- **Insecure session lifetime:** User sessions were tracked in memory without an enforced timeout beyond server restart, which could potentially lead to indefinite session retention if the server was never restarted.
- **Missing server-side session validation:** Lack of server-side enforcement of session expiry based on activity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:**  Stolen "remember me" cookies could be used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts indefinitely.
- **Session hijacking:** Existing sessions could be exploited to maintain access even after the user's password was changed, compromising account security.
- **Persistent unauthorized access:** In the absence of session invalidation upon password changes, an attacker could maintain access if they had obtained a valid session previously.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Cookie theft:** An attacker could potentially obtain valid "remember me" cookies through network interception or other means.
- **Password compromise:** If an attacker gained access to the account and changed the password, they could still maintain access through existing sessions unless the sessions were invalidated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access/interception:** An attacker could potentially intercept network traffic to obtain valid session or "remember me" cookies.
- **Compromise of existing sessions:**  An attacker could gain initial access by traditional means (e.g. password compromise) and then continue to access the account using an old session cookie, without the need for valid credentials if sessions are not invalidated.

**Mitigation implemented in the commit:**
- **Tie remember-me cookie to password hash:**  The "remember me" cookie is now tied to a password hash, so changing the password will invalidate the cookie.
- **Invalidate user sessions on password change:** All active user sessions are invalidated when a user's password is changed, forcing a re-login.
- **Session invalidation after 15 minutes of inactivity:** A session is now only considered fresh if the user is active in the past 15 minutes, otherwise, it gets invalidated.
- **Limit remember-me validity to 90 days:**  The "remember me" cookie is now limited to 90 days, forcing users to log in again periodically.
- **Session signature:** Session ids are now signed with a key based on the user's password hash. This is used to detect session tampering and to ensure that sessions are invalidated on password change.

This commit addresses multiple security concerns related to session and cookie management, significantly improving the application's security posture by implementing stricter session handling and validation.
