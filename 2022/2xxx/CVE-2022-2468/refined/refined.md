Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-2468:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the `editbrand.php` file of the Garage Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in `editbrand.php`, before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of successful exploitation is that an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could allow them to:
    - Access sensitive data
    - Modify or delete data
    - Potentially gain full control of the database server

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `editbrand.php`, including a malicious SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable URL (`editbrand.php`) and parameter (`id`).
- No authentication or authorization details required.
