The provided content relates to CVE-2022-2168.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape a generated URL before outputting it within an attribute of the history dashboard. This allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, defacement of the website, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL with injected malicious javascript code in the `user_ids` parameter, which is then reflected in the history dashboard of the plugin's admin page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to visit it, typically by tricking an admin into visiting the link.
