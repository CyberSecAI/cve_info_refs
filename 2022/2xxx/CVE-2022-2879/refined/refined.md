```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `archive/tar` package's `Reader.Read` method did not enforce a limit on the size of file headers, allowing for unbounded memory allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unbounded memory consumption",
    "Resource exhaustion",
	"Potential panics"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A maliciously crafted archive could cause the `Reader.Read` method to allocate unbounded amounts of memory, leading to resource exhaustion or program crashes.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can provide a specially crafted tar archive to the vulnerable `Reader.Read` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious tar archive to be processed by the vulnerable code. No special privileges or user interaction is required."
