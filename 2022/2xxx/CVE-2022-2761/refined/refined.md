{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Jira issue descriptions are rendered using GFM (GitLab Flavored Markdown), but the references are not redacted. This results in private/confidential information being leaked to unauthorized users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inadequate redaction of GFM references in Jira issue descriptions. Specifically, the `JiraGfmPipeline` does not properly handle private/confidential references.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access titles and other information from private or confidential GitLab resources (issues, merge requests, etc.) by including references to them in Jira issue descriptions. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker leverages the integration between GitLab and Jira. They create a Jira issue with a description containing references to private GitLab resources.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a premium GitLab subscription (or access to a free trial), and the ability to create Jira issues. They also need the knowledge of the target's private project's GFM reference."
