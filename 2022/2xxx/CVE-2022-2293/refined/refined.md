```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'customer_name' parameter when creating a new order.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application stores the unsanitized input in the database which is then displayed to other users. ",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which can lead to cookie theft, account hijacking or other malicious actions when the stored data is rendered in the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the /ci_ssms/index.php/orders/create endpoint, injecting the malicious payload in the customer_name parameter. The payload is stored in the database and is rendered when the order is viewed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit POST requests to the application. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability."
