```
Hello,

We have just released gnutls-3.7.7. This is a bug fix and enhancement
release on the 3.7.x branch.

We would like to thank everyone who contributed in this release:
Ludovic Courtès, Brad Smith, Richard Costa, Gregor Jasny, Alexander
Sosedkin, František Krenželok, Daiki Ueno and Zoltan Fridrich

The detailed list of changes follows:

* Version 3.7.7 (released 2022-07-28)

** libgnutls: Fixed double free during verification of pkcs7 signatures.
Reported by Jaak Ristioja (#1383). [GNUTLS-SA-2022-07-07, CVSS: medium]
[CVE-2022-2509]

** libgnutls: gnutls_hkdf_expand now only accepts LENGTH argument less
than or equal to 255 times hash digest size, to comply with RFC 5869 2.3.

** libgnutls: Length limit for TLS PSK usernames has been increased from
128 to 65535 characters (#1323).

** libgnutls: AES-GCM encryption function now limits plaintext length to
2^39-256 bits, according to SP800-38D 5.2.1.1.

** libgnutls: New block cipher functions have been added to
transparently handle padding. gnutls_cipher_encrypt3 and
gnutls_cipher_decrypt3 can be used in combination of
GNUTLS_CIPHER_PADDING_PKCS7 flag to automatically add/remove padding if
the length of the original plaintext is not a multiple of the block size.

** libgnutls: New function for manual FIPS self-testing.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_fips140_run_self_tests: New function
gnutls_cipher_encrypt3: New function
gnutls_cipher_decrypt3: New function
gnutls_cipher_padding_flags_t: New enum

** guile: Guile 1.8 is no longer supported

** guile: Session record port treats premature termination as EOF
Previously, a ‘gnutls-error’ exception with the
‘error/premature-termination’ value would be thrown while reading from a
session record port when the underlying session was terminated
prematurely. This was inconvenient since users of the port may not be
prepared to handle such an exception. Reading from the session record
port now returns the end-of-file object instead of throwing an
exception, just like it would for a proper session termination.

** guile: Session record ports can have a ‘close’ procedure. The
‘session-record-port’ procedure now takes an optional second parameter,
and a new ‘set-session-record-port-close!’ procedure is provided to
specify a ‘close’ procedure for a session record port. This ‘close’
procedure lets users specify cleanup operations for when the port is
closed, such as closing the file descriptor or port that backs the
underlying session.

Package        : gnutls28
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2509

Jaak Ristioja discovered a double-free vulnerability in GnuTLS, a
library implementing the TLS and SSL protocols, during verification of
pkcs7 signatures. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
cause an application using the GnuTLS library to crash (denial of
service), or potentially, to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.1-5+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.

For the detailed security status of gnutls28 please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gnutls28>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Package        : gnutls28
Version        : 3.6.7-4+deb10u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-4209 CVE-2022-2509

Two issues were found in GnuTLS, a library implementing the TLS and SSL
protocols. A remote attacker could take advantage of these flaws to
cause an application using the GnuTLS library to crash (denial of
service), or potentially, to execute arbitrary code.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.6.7-4+deb10u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.

For the detailed security status of gnutls28 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gnutls28>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
