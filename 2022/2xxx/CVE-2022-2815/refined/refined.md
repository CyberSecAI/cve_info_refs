Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The commit `af69097d349f4c00f244c51cd3c3e937fd3387cd` introduces changes to strip EXIF data from resource uploads in the `publify` project. This suggests a vulnerability related to the presence of potentially malicious or sensitive data embedded within the EXIF metadata of uploaded image files.  While not directly stated as a vulnerability fix, the commit message "Strip EXIF data from resource uploads" and the associated code changes strongly indicate that the previous implementation was vulnerable to this issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **EXIF Data Exposure:**  Image files can contain EXIF metadata, which might include sensitive information such as GPS coordinates, camera model, and potentially even user-specific details. Without sanitization, this data could be exposed.
-   **Potential for Malicious EXIF:** Malicious actors could embed harmful scripts or code in EXIF data, which could be executed when the image is processed or viewed, although this isn't specifically covered in the commit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of sensitive user or location data present in EXIF metadata.
-   **Potential for further attacks:** While not specifically detailed, the inclusion of malicious scripts in EXIF data could potentially lead to further attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), however, this specific commit doesn't directly address XSS in the image content itself but rather the EXIF data only.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **File Upload:** An attacker would upload a crafted image file containing malicious or sensitive EXIF data via the resource upload functionality of `publify`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the `publify` application via its resource upload interface. This likely means they would require an account and necessary permissions.
-   **Knowledge of the System:** The attacker would likely have some understanding of how the application processes and handles resource uploads.

**Technical Details:**

The commit includes the following changes:
*  **`resource_uploader.rb` Modification**: The `ResourceUploader` class is updated to include  `process :strip, if: :image?`. The `strip` method uses MiniMagick to remove EXIF data from images during upload. This indicates that the uploaded image files were not sanitized before the change, leading to the potential security issues related to metadata.

*   **Test Case Addition**:  A test case is added to `resources_controller_spec.rb` that specifically tests if EXIF data is stripped from the images. This reinforces that the vulnerability existed and is addressed by the commit.

**Summary:**

The commit addresses a vulnerability related to the presence of EXIF data in uploaded images by stripping the metadata. This prevents exposure of sensitive information and reduces the risk of attacks that could leverage malicious EXIF data.
