### Plugin: Image Hover Effects Ultimate
**Affected Versions:** <= 9.7.3
**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2937
**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping for the Title & Description values that can be added to an Image Hover.
**Attack Vector:** Authenticated users with the ability to edit Image Hovers can inject arbitrary web scripts into the Title & Description fields.
**Impact:** The injected malicious scripts will execute whenever a user accesses a page displaying the affected image hover.
**Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires an authenticated user, typically with administrator privileges, however lower-privileged users can exploit if the site admin modifies the “Who Can Edit?” setting, allowing them to edit Image Hovers.
