Fix [#415 (closed)](/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/415 "tiffcrop: FPE in computeOutputPixelOffsets, tiffcrop.c:5817"), [#427 (closed)](/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/427 "tiffcrop: FPE in computeOutputPixelOffsets, tiffcrop.c:5936 (Different from #347)"), and [#428 (closed)](/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/428 "tiffcrop: FPE in computeOutputPixelOffsets, tiffcrop.c:5941").

I have made two editions:

First, I created a convert function (`_TIFFClampDoubleToUInt32`) in `tif_aux.c`, and declared it in `tiffiop.h`. Then I called this function on all lines of code that convert `double` to `uint32_t`. I did this because converting `double` to `uint32_t` with `(uint32_t)` will cause some large double values to be truncated.

```
//tif_aux.c
uint32_t _TIFFClampDoubleToUInt32(double val)
{
    if( val < 0 )
        return 0;
    if( val > 0xFFFFFFFFU || val != val )
        return 0xFFFFFFFFU;
    return (uint32_t)val;
}

//tiffiop.h
extern float _TIFFClampDoubleToFloat(double);
extern uint32_t _TIFFClampDoubleToUInt32(double);
```

Second, I added a check for integer overflow in `tiffcrop.c`.

```
if (owidth == 0 || olength == 0)
{
    TIFFError("computeOutputPixelOffsets", "Integer overflow when calculating the number of pages");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

Debian Bug     : 1011160 1014494 1022555 1024737

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in tiff, a library and tools
providing support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), leading to
denial of service (DoS) and possibly local code execution.

CVE-2022-1354

    A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffinfo.c in
    TIFFReadRawDataStriped() function. This flaw allows an attacker to
    pass a crafted TIFF file to the tiffinfo tool, triggering a heap
    buffer overflow issue and causing a crash that leads to a denial
    of service.

CVE-2022-1355

    A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffcp.c in
    main() function. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a crafted
    TIFF file to the tiffcp tool, triggering a stack buffer overflow
    issue, possibly corrupting the memory, and causing a crash that
    leads to a denial of service.

CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058

    Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop allows attackers to cause a
    denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

CVE-2022-2867, CVE-2022-2868, CVE-2022-2869

    libtiff's tiffcrop utility has underflow and input validation flaw
    that can lead to out of bounds read and write. An attacker who
    supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to
    run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters) could cause a crash or
    in some cases, further exploitation.

CVE-2022-3570, CVE-2022-3598

    Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff
    allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access
    via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application
    crash, potential information disclosure or any other
    context-dependent impact.

CVE-2022-3597, CVE-2022-3626, CVE-2022-3627

    Out-of-bounds write, allowing attackers to cause a
    denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file.

CVE-2022-3599

    Out-of-bounds read in writeSingleSection in tools/tiffcrop.c,
    allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff
    file.

CVE-2022-3970

    Affects the function TIFFReadRGBATileExt of the file
    libtiff/tif_getimage.c. The manipulation leads to integer
    overflow.

CVE-2022-34526

    A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of
    Tiffsplit. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial
    of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file parsed by the "tiffsplit"
    or "tiffcrop" utilities.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.1.0+git191117-2~deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

its security tracker page at:

Debian Bug     : 1011160 1014494 1022555 1024737 1029653

Several buffer overflow, divide by zero or out of bounds read/write
vulnerabilities were discovered in tiff, the Tag Image File Format (TIFF)
library and tools, which may cause denial of service when processing a
crafted TIFF image.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.0-1+deb11u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

For the detailed security status of tiff please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tiff>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
