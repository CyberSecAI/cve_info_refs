The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2029, as it describes a commit that fixes multiple security vulnerabilities, including stored XSS and formula injection.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The commit addresses three stored XSS vulnerabilities and a formula injection vulnerability. The exact root causes of the vulnerabilities are not detailed in this commit message, but they are related to how user inputs are handled in the application, especially in the charting, timetable components, and excel export functionality.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** User-controlled data was not being properly sanitized, leading to stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
- **Formula Injection:** User-controlled data was not sanitized when being exported to excel, leading to formula injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application that would be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially allowing them to steal cookies, access user data, or perform actions on their behalf.
- **Formula Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious formulas into the excel export, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when the victim opens the excel file.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Stored XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into input fields that are later displayed to other users.
- **Formula Injection:** Injecting malicious formulas in data that is later exported to an Excel file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit user input into the vulnerable application to inject malicious content. This typically means having an account and the ability to enter data into the application.
- For formula injection, the attacker must have control over data that is included in the excel export function.
