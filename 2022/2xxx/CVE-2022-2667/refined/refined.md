The provided content relates to SQL injection vulnerabilities found in a Loan Management System.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and the use of direct string concatenation for building SQL queries, instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to both boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection.
    *   **login.php:** The username and password parameters are vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **delete\_lplan.php:** The lplan\_id parameter is vulnerable, allowing attackers to potentially manipulate or delete arbitrary data from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login mechanism.
*   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:** Through time-based injections, attackers might cause delays and potentially impact the application's availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The login.php page is vulnerable via the `username` and `password` parameters in a POST request.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The delete_lplan.php page is vulnerable via the `lplan_id` parameter in a GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No authentication is needed to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities in `delete_lplan.php`. However, exploiting login.php would allow access to authenticated functionality.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques is required for exploitation. The use of sqlmap tool demonstrates that these vulnerabilities are easily identified.
