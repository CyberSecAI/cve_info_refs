The provided content is related to a commit in the `nakama` repository, specifically focusing on changes related to console authentication and logout functionality. While the commit message and the changes themselves suggest a fix related to session tokens during logout, there is no direct mention or indication of a vulnerability, such as incorrect authentication handling or session hijacking.

The changes introduce a new `AuthenticateLogout` RPC call in `console.proto`, accompanied by corresponding updates in the generated `.pb.go`, `.pb.gw.go`, and `_grpc.pb.go` files, as well as the swagger definition. This implies the previous logout implementation might have been insufficient. Additionally, some changes were made to the UI code related to the `authentication.service.ts` to accommodate these changes.

Given the changes focus on fixing inconsistencies in session token handling during logout, they appear to address a potential logic issue rather than a security vulnerability. Therefore, based on the provided content, there is no clear evidence of a vulnerability that can be linked to CVE-2022-2306, which is described as "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval".

Therefore:
