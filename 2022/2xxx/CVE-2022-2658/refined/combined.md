## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Spell Check < 9.13 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape ignored words, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Add a word to ignore (via /wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-spellcheck-ignore.php) with the following payload: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be trigged each time the ignore dashboard is accessed
