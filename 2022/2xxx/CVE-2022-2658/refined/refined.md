- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape ignored words.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin privileges can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin privileges can add a malicious payload within the "ignored words" section via the plugin's settings page (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-spellcheck-ignore.php). The XSS payload is triggered each time the ignore dashboard is accessed by a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress dashboard.
