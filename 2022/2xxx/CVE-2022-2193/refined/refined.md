Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-2193:

**Root Cause:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.

**Weakness:** The HYPR Server, prior to version 6.14.1, fails to properly control access to resources, allowing for manipulation via direct object references. Specifically, an attacker can tamper with parameters in the Device Manager page to add a FIDO2 authenticator to arbitrary accounts.

**Impact:** An authenticated attacker can add a FIDO2 authenticator to an arbitrary user account. This would allow them to potentially bypass existing authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the targeted account.

**Attack Vector:** Remote, the attacker needs to be authenticated to the HYPR Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have valid authentication credentials to the HYPR Server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the Device Manager page of the HYPR Server.

**Additional Notes:** This vulnerability is present in HYPR Server versions before 6.14.1. The vulnerability is exploitable through parameter tampering in the Device Manager page.
