The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2072.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The payload is also saved into the database, leading to Stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially leading to actions being performed on behalf of the user, stealing session cookies, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a crafted POST request to the `admin.php` page with a malicious payload in the `name` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific user privileges seem required for the Reflected XSS. The Stored XSS is achieved by the same mechanism, and it also requires no specific privileges.
