Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Wedding Hall Booking System (WHBS) lacks proper input and output sanitization. It does not filter or encode user-supplied data, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system is vulnerable to multiple XSS vulnerabilities. Malicious JavaScript can be injected via various input fields and displayed in different parts of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code to steal user and administrator cookies.
*   **Account Hijacking:** Stolen cookies can be used to hijack user or admin sessions and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Other Malicious Actions:** Through XSS, attackers could also perform actions like redirecting users to malicious websites, defacing pages, or performing other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Contact Us Form:** Input fields in the contact us form are vulnerable.
*   **Booking Form:** Input fields related to bookings are susceptible to XSS.
*   **Profile Page:** User profile information update fields are vulnerable.
*   **Staff User Profile:** Staff profile editing fields are also vulnerable.
*   **Client lists:** XSS vulnerabilities are present when viewing client lists

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Interaction:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application through a browser.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the vulnerable input fields.
*   **No special privileges:** Attackers don't need elevated privileges, they just need to interact with the forms like a regular user

**Specific vulnerable pages:**
* `/whbs/?page=contact_us`
* `/whbs/?page=my_bookings`
* `/whbs/admin/?page=bookings`
* `/whbs/?page=manage_account`
* `/whbs/?page=profile`
* `/whbs/admin/?page=clients`
* `/whbs/admin/?page=user`
* `/whbs/admin/?page=user/list`

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content includes screenshots, which confirm that XSS can be executed, and the system is vulnerable.
* The vulnerability affects both users and administrators.
* The system does not sanitize input at all, making it relatively easy to exploit XSS.
* The document refers to "SourceCodester" as the original source of the application.

This detailed analysis confirms the presence of multiple XSS vulnerabilities due to lack of sanitization of user inputs, which can lead to cookie theft and account hijacking if exploited.
