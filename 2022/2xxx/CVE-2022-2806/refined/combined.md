### @didib **[didib](/didib)** commented [May 26, 2022](#issue-1249597427) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

Instead of hard-coding specific keys and having to maintain them over

time, replace the values of all keys that have 'password' in their name.

I think this covers all our current and hopefully future keys. It might

add "false positives" - keys that are not passwords but have 'password'

in their name - and I think that's a risk worth taking.

A partial list of keys added since the replaced code was written:

* grafana-related stuff
* keycloak-related stuff
* otopi-style answer files
