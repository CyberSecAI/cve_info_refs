## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Bold Page Builder < 4.3.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to Settings -> Bold Builder -> Bold Builder Settings and enter "</textarea><script>alert('XSS')</script>" into the "Color Schemes" input field.
2. Click Save Changes.
3. You will observe that the payload successfully got stored into the database and when you are triggering the same functionality at that time JavaScript payload is executing successfully and we are getting a pop-up.
