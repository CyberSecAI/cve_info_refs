Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Brizy Page Builder plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape element content. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored within the website's database. This injected script is executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view content created using the Brizy page builder.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing user cookies/credentials
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Brizy page builder's text and embed elements.
- Attackers can inject malicious script payloads within the content of these elements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- They must be able to create or edit posts using the Brizy editor.
- The attacker does not need administrative access to execute the stored XSS. The XSS will trigger when the affected content is viewed/previewed, for example by an admin reviewing the post.

**Specific details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Brizy Page Builder versions prior to 2.4.2
- The specific payload examples provided in the Proof of Concept:
    - Text Element payload: `<SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>`
    - Embed Element payload: `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`

This analysis aligns with the provided CVE description which indicates that there is a Stored Cross Site Scripting vulnerability within the plugin.
