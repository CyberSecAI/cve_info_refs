- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User enumeration vulnerability in AMI MegaRAC SPX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The advisory mentions "User Enumeration" as the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain high-level information (confidentiality impact is high) on the users of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) and no user interaction is required (UI:N) for exploitation, and low attack complexity (AC:L).
