Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Cache Images" WordPress plugin versions prior to 3.2.1 lack nonce checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF, stemming from the absence of nonce validation. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform actions within the "Cache Images" plugin, specifically:
    *   Upload images.
    *   Import images from arbitrary URLs.
    *   Trigger image regeneration processes.
*   This could lead to the injection of malicious images into the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTML form that targets the plugin's AJAX endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`).
*   The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or link that automatically submits the forged form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Position:** The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress site. They need to be able to host or distribute a malicious page with the forged form or a link to such a page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft an HTML form with the necessary parameters, specifically the `action` (set to `cache_images`) and a chosen `do` parameter. They also need to be able to trick a logged-in user into triggering this form.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content includes proof-of-concept code snippets for exploiting the CSRF vulnerability to perform actions like fetching domain lists, getting image lists and image regeneration.
* The plugin has been fixed in version 3.2.1.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.0 (medium).
* The CWE is CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery.
* The OWASP Top 10 category is A2: Broken Authentication and Session Management
