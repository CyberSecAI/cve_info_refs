Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2520:

**CVE-2022-2520:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The primary cause is related to improper handling of command-line arguments, specifically the `-S` option in `tiffcrop` when used in conjunction with other cropping options (`-X`, `-Y`, `-Z`, `-z`).  The `-S` option is intended to be mutually exclusive, but this was not enforced, leading to issues when combined with other cropping options. This improper handling of arguments leads to out-of-bounds access due to incorrect calculations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Heap buffer overflow:** Reported at tiffcrop.c:6841:16, tiffcrop.c:6905 in extractImageSection
    *   **Invalid free:**  A free of an invalid pointer occurs in TIFFClose() at tif_close.c:131, triggered by tiffcrop.c:2522.
    *   **Double free/corruption:** Issues are in rotateImage() at tiffcrop.c:8839.
    *   **`sysmalloc` assertion failure:** Occurs in rotateImage() at tiffcrop.c:8621 due to improper memory allocation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can cause:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The program crashes due to memory corruption or assertion failures.
    *   **Potential arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution in some situations.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through crafted TIFF images and specific command-line arguments passed to the `tiffcrop` tool. By providing a malicious TIFF file and specific combinations of arguments, an attacker can trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted TIFF image to `tiffcrop`.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to specify the command line arguments to `tiffcrop`.
    *   The attacker can be a local user able to execute the program or a remote attacker able to pass the crafted file and arguments to the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves enforcing mutual exclusivity of the `-S` option with other cropping options, preventing the program from proceeding with incompatible configurations and subsequent memory corruption issues.
*   The gitlab issue #424 shows a detailed crash report including the call stack with a sysmalloc assertion, highlighting the vulnerability in the rotateImage function.
