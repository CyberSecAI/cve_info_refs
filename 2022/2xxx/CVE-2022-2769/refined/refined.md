Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Company Website CMS" when handling data submitted to the `/dashboard/contact` endpoint, specifically the 'phone1' and 'phone2' parameters. The application does not filter user-supplied content, allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is saved in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected page.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate users.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Executing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/dashboard/contact` endpoint.
- **Form Data Injection:** The payload is injected into the `phone1` and `phone2` form fields within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the `/dashboard/contact` endpoint of the vulnerable "Company Website CMS".
- No special access rights are mentioned in this exploit description.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and the ability to craft the appropriate HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Parameters:** The `phone1` and `phone2` parameters within the form data are vulnerable.
- **Payload:** The provided payload `+89 (0) 2354 5470091<img src="" onerror="alert(1)">` demonstrates the injection of an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler that executes `alert(1)`. This serves as a basic proof of concept.

**Summary:**

The provided text describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the "Company Website CMS." By injecting malicious JavaScript into the `phone1` and `phone2` fields of the `/dashboard/contact` form, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the browsers of users who later view the page where these phone numbers are displayed.
