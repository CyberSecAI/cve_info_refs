- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users (e.g., admin) can perform XSS attacks, even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed. A well-crafted XSS payload can leak into the front page.
- **Attack vectors:** By entering a malicious payload into the plugin's UET Tag ID settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user such as an administrator.
