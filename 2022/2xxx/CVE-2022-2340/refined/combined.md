## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# W-DALIL <= 2.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its fields, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Add/edit a Dali Item and put the following payload in one of the text fields in the "Dali Item Information" section (e.g Dali Item Address): "><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>

### Affects Plugins
