- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin has an AJAX action (`mailchimp_woocommerce_oauth_status`) that allows any logged-in user to make POST requests on behalf of the server to an arbitrary URL specified in the `url` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize the URL provided by the user, allowing an attacker to make the server perform requests to internal or external resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to scan the internal network or LAN, potentially discovering vulnerable services or sensitive information. The response from the target URL is appended to the response from the vulnerable AJAX action, giving attackers visibility into the target endpoint response.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action set to `mailchimp_woocommerce_oauth_status` and the `url` parameter set to the desired target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site, with at least the subscriber role.
