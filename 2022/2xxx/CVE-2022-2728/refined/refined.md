The provided content details SQL injection vulnerabilities in a Gym Management System project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Both POST and GET based SQL injection vulnerabilities are present.
    *   POST-type injection is found in `/mygym/admin/login.php` via the `admin_email` and `admin_pass` fields.
    *   GET-type injection is found in `/mygym/admin/index.php?edit_tran`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can obtain sensitive database information.
*   An attacker can modify database content.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **POST Request:** Attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `admin_email` and `admin_pass` fields of the login form.
*   **GET Request:** Attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `edit_tran` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the login page and the vulnerable page.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious queries.
