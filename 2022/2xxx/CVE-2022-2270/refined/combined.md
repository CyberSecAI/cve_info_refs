# Unauthorized read for conan repository

**[HackerOne report #901473](https://hackerone.com/reports/901473)** by `fushbey` on 2020-06-18, assigned to [@jeremymatos](/jeremymatos "Jeremy Matos"):

### Summary

Hi, I want to report an unauthorized read related to conan packages, I was not quite familiar with Conan so I had doubts but after several trying, I am confident the bug is there, please confirm to me if I am right.

The bug is, a user that is Guest in a private group, can list Conan packages available in the registry despite not having enough access level, indeed the web restricts access:

* When accessing the Web page for the group > Packages & Registries . Surprisingly this menu item is shown, however on clicking on it the page shows an error message: `Something went wrong while fetching the packages list.` , Inspecting the network calls we see indeed we got a 403 response. to `/api/v4/groups/6/packages?page=1&per_page=20&sort=desc&order_by=created_at&package_name=`. I come back to this API call later.

  -When accessing the Web page for our project The menu item "Packages & repositories" is not even shown, accessing it directly with the URL returns a 404.

However, using `conan search` does return results.

### Steps to reproduce

I am gonna assume you installed conan successfully (which by the way did not install very easily on my Gitlab EE container)

1 - userA creates a private group: cpp-group

1 - userA creates a private project in that group: cpp-hello

1 - userA invites userB as guest

1 - userA: Create a Conan package as explained [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/conan_repository/index.html)

\* `conan new Hello/1.0 -t`

\* `conan create . cpp-group+cpp-hello/beta`

2 - userA: Add our Conan registry to remote:

`conan remote add gitlab https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/packages/conan`

3 - Upload the package with the owner of the private group

```
CONAN_LOGIN_USERNAME=userA CONAN_PASSWORD=<userA PAT> conan upload Hello/0.1@cpp-group+cpp-hello/beta --all
```

4 - Search for Hello package using userA

```
CONAN_LOGIN_USERNAME=userA CONAN_PASSWORD=<userA PAT> conan search Hello* -r gitlab

Existing package recipes:

Hello/1.0@cpp-group+cpp-hello/beta

```

5 - Delete userA from cache, make sure it worked:

```
conan user && conan user --clean && conan user
```

6 - search for packages using userB

```
CONAN_LOGIN_USERNAME=userB CONAN_PASSWORD=<userB PAT> conan search Hello* -r gitlab

Existing package recipes:

Hello/1.0@cpp-group+cpp-hello/beta
```

7 - Compare that with the API call:

```
curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer <userB'sPAT>' 'http://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/groups/<PROJECT_ID>/packages?page=1&per_page=20&sort=desc&order_by=created_at&package_name=' | jq
{
  "message": "403 Forbidden"
}

```

To prove myself there is a bug and not some caching problem I tested outside the container with userB and still worked.

### Impact

The user can list recipes from a private Conan registry although the Web does not show them.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Allowing unauthorized users to know the packages used in a repository with a private Conan registry.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Same as the Web UI (and API), return a forbidden response instead of showing the package name.

## Impact

Read above.
