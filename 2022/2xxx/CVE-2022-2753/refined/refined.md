- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape user inputs for reservation fields like "FullName", "Phone Number", and "Email".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the reservation fields. When an administrator views the malicious reservation, the script is executed in the admin's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker makes a reservation via the plugin's form and includes a malicious payload in one of the vulnerable input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to access the publicly available reservation form.
