Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `downloadFiles.php` script. The script directly uses the `$_GET['download']` parameter, which specifies the file to be downloaded, without any validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The `downloadFiles.php` script is vulnerable to an arbitrary file download vulnerability. The `$_GET['download']` parameter is used directly in `readfile()` function without any checks to ensure the file is within an allowed directory or if the user is authorized to access it.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks any input validation on the `$_GET['download']` parameter, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to download any file that the web server process has access to. This could include configuration files, database credentials, source code, or other sensitive data, leading to severe information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `downloadFiles.php` with the `download` parameter set to the path of the file to be downloaded. For example, `http://127.0.0.1/downloadFiles.php?download=config/config.php` attempts to download the config.php file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **No Authentication:** Based on the code provided, there is no requirement for the attacker to be authenticated. The vulnerability can be exploited by any user that has access to the vulnerable endpoint.
