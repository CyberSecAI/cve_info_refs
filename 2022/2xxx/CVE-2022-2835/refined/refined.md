Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that a malicious user can reroute internal calls to internal services. These services are accessed using Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) in the format `<service>.<namespace>.svc`. This indicates a potential flaw in how CoreDNS handles DNS resolution for internal services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DNS Redirection:** The core weakness is the ability of an attacker to redirect DNS queries for internal services. This implies a lack of proper validation or access control on how DNS queries are resolved within the CoreDNS environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Service Compromise:** By redirecting DNS queries, an attacker can potentially intercept or redirect traffic intended for internal services, potentially leading to a compromise of those services. This can include data exfiltration, service disruption, or further exploitation of the compromised service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DNS Manipulation:**  The attack involves manipulating the DNS resolution process within CoreDNS. The specifics of how the manipulation is performed are not detailed, but it suggests a vulnerability in CoreDNS itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious User:** The attacker needs to be a "malicious user" within the environment.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker likely needs to have some level of network access to interact with the CoreDNS service. The specific access level is not explicitly stated but implies access to the network segment where DNS queries for internal services are handled.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bug report mentions that the affected services are accessed via FQDNs in the format `<service>.<namespace>.svc`.
*   The vulnerability is associated with the CWE-923 which refers to Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
*   The description references OpenShift admission plug-ins, suggesting the issue may be relevant in containerized environments using OpenShift.
