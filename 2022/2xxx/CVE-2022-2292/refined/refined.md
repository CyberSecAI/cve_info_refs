The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Hotel Management System version 2.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user input submitted to the "Massageroom Details" parameter on the massage_room edit page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application stores unsanitized user-provided input in the database, and renders it back to users without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browser of any user who views the affected page.
- Specifically, the proof of concept indicates that the attacker could steal cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/ci_hms/massage_room/edit/1` endpoint containing malicious JavaScript code in the `massageroomDetails` parameter. The vulnerability is triggered when the application displays the stored, malicious payload back to the user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit data to the vulnerable endpoint (likely requiring being logged in).
- The attacker needs to know the correct URL/parameters to target the vulnerability, specifically the `massageroomDetails` parameter on the massage room edit page.
