## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Form Builder CP < 1.2.32 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its form settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a form and put the following payload in the Form name settings: "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>

### Affects Plugins
