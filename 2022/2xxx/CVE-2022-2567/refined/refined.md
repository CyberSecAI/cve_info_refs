- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its form settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows high privilege users, such as admins, to inject malicious scripts that can execute in the browsers of other users.
- **Attack vectors**: By creating or editing a form and inserting a malicious script within the "Form name" settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high privilege user (e.g. administrator) of the WordPress site.
