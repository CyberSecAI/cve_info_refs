```
{
  "CVE-2022-2625": {
    "Root cause": "Some PostgreSQL extensions use `CREATE OR REPLACE` or `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS` commands without adhering to the rule of only targeting objects known to be extension members.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper object management in extension scripts"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can run arbitrary code as the victim role, potentially gaining superuser privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs permission to create non-temporary objects in a schema, then lure an administrator into creating or updating a vulnerable extension in that schema. Subsequently, a victim must be lured into using the object targeted by the `CREATE OR REPLACE` or `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS` commands.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema. Also ability to lure or wait for an administrator to create or update an affected extension in that schema, and ability to lure or wait for a victim to use the object targeted in the flawed command."
