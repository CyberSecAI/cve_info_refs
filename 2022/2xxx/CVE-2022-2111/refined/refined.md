```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application was vulnerable to formula injection attacks in CSV exports and was also susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to improper handling of user-provided data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Formula injection in CSV export",
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious formulas into CSV files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when opened by the victim. An attacker could inject malicious code through user-provided data that would be executed in the browser of other users leading to information disclosure or other malicious activity.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Malicious data in CSV export",
    "User-provided input rendered in the UI"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to influence data that is being exported to a CSV file or inject malicious code through user-provided data. An attacker needs to have access to the application where they can inject malicious code, either during data input or data export."
