- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Horner Automation RCC 972 firmware version 15.40 contains global variables.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Excessive Reliance on Global Variables (CWE-1108). The firmware uses global variables to store sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could read out sensitive values and variable keys from the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with network access to the device.
