- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Post SMTP plugin does not properly sanitize/escape some of its settings before outputting them in the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high privilege user can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings that are later executed by other users who access the admin dashboard. This allows the attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin level access can inject a malicious payload into the plugin's settings, specifically the "Temporary Directory" setting. When other users view the settings page, the XSS payload will be executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in the WordPress instance in order to modify the plugin's settings.
