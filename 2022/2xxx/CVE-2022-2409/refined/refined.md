- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape chart data labels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied chart data labels, allowing arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to be stored in the database.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the affected chart. This can lead to various attacks including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator privileges. The attacker can inject the malicious payload by creating or editing a chart, adding the malicious script in a chart data label, and saving the chart. The XSS is triggered when another user (including the attacker) views the chart and clicks on the injected label.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to create and edit charts.
