## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Rough Chart <= 1.0.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not properly escape chart data label, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Create a chart (/wp-admin/themes.php?page=rough\_chart), add the following payload in a Chart Data Label and save it: <a href="javascript:alert(/XSS/)">XSS</a>
The XSS will be triggered when viewing the chart and clicking on the label
