Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes related to rate limiting login attempts, which is likely the context for CVE-2022-2822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability being addressed is the lack of rate limiting on login attempts. Without rate limiting, the login endpoint is susceptible to brute-force attacks, especially on insecure networks where OctoPrint instances might be exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  The core weakness is the absence of a mechanism to restrict the number of login attempts within a given time frame, making brute-force attacks feasible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** An attacker could attempt to guess user credentials through repeated login attempts. Successful brute-force attacks can lead to unauthorized access to OctoPrint and the connected 3D printer, potentially enabling malicious actions like altering printer settings, printing malicious designs or causing physical damage to the printer.
- **Denial of Service:**  While not directly a DoS vulnerability, a sustained brute-force attack could impact server performance and availability for legitimate users by consuming resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the OctoPrint instance's login page. This could be from the same local network or from the internet, if the OctoPrint is exposed without proper security configurations.
- **Brute Force Attempts:** The attacker would send repeated login requests with different username/password combinations to guess valid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must be able to reach the OctoPrint server through the network (local or internet).
- **Basic Scripting Knowledge:**  Automated tools or scripts can be used to perform brute force attacks. No sophisticated attack knowledge is required.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content shows the implementation of a rate-limiting mechanism using `flask-limiter` on the `/login` API endpoint. Specific changes include:

-   **`setup.py`:** Added `Flask-Limiter` as a dependency.
-   **`src/octoprint/server/__init__.py`:**
    -   Imported `Limiter` and `get_remote_address` from `flask-limiter`.
    -   Initialized the `limiter` with a strategy and a key function (`get_remote_address` to limit by IP).
-   **`src/octoprint/server/api/__init__.py`:**
    -   Applied the `@octoprint.server.limiter.limit` decorator to the `/login` route:  `3/minute;5/10 minutes;10/hour`
        - Limits login attempts to 3 per minute, 5 per 10 minutes, and 10 per hour.
        - Uses `deduct_when=lambda response: response.status_code == 403` to only count failed attempts toward the limit
        - Adds a custom error message shown upon limit reached
-   **`src/octoprint/static/js/login/login.js`**: Modified the error handling to display specific messages when the login fails due to the rate limit (HTTP 429 status code).
-   **`src/octoprint/static/css/login.css` & `src/octoprint/static/less/login.less`:** Minor CSS adjustments to show/hide the rate limit error message.
-   **`src/octoprint/templates/login.jinja2`:** Added the HTML markup for the rate limit error message

This commit introduces a rate limit, thus mitigating the brute force vulnerability by restricting the frequency of login attempts and adding a specific error message for exceeded rate limits

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message "üîíÔ∏è Rate limit failed login attempts" confirms this commit's purpose is to add rate limiting as a security measure.
- The text mentions "Should reduce likelihood of brute force attacks on unsecure networks if users decide to deploy/make OctoPrint accessible there against all advice to the contrary." This statement confirms the understanding that exposing Octoprint on unsecure networks is a risk and that this measure is to mitigate the risks
