- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and validate the `filename` parameter before using it in a `require` statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or further exploitation.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a malicious `filename` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires administrator privileges to access the admin dashboard and send the malicious request.
