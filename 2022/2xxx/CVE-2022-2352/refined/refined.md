Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The Post SMTP plugin lacks proper authorization checks for certain AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to make requests to arbitrary URLs via the server, without direct visibility of the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can use the server to scan internal networks or interact with services that are not directly exposed to the internet. In the provided example, the attacker can check if ports are open in the server's internal network.
* The vulnerability is described as "blind" which means the attacker does not receive feedback, other than time taken to get a result.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The vulnerability is triggered through specific AJAX actions within the WordPress admin panel. Specifically, the `postman_test_smtps` and `postman_test_port` actions.
* The attacker needs to manipulate the `hostname` and `port` parameters in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have admin level privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is triggered through the WordPress admin panel, so the attacker needs access to the backend of the affected WordPress instance.
