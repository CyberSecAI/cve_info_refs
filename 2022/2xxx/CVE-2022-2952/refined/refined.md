The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2952.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Access of uninitialized pointer. Specifically, data from a faulting address controls code flow starting at `gmmiObj!CGmmiOptionContainer`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Access of uninitialized pointer (CWE-824)

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attack complexity is low (AC:L) and no privileges are required (PR:N), the user interaction is required (UI:R), and the scope is unchanged (S:U).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  A local attacker with the ability to cause the program to reach the vulnerable code section where the uninitialized pointer is accessed, and user interaction is required for exploitation.
