Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-2058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a Floating Point Exception (FPE) within the `computeOutputPixelOffsets` function in `tiffcrop.c`. Specifically, a division by zero can occur.
- The issue arises when converting double values to uint32_t which leads to truncation. This occurs in `computeOutputPixelOffsets` in `tiffcrop.c`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Division by zero error: The code does not properly check for zero values before performing a division operation leading to a floating point exception.
- Integer truncation when converting double to unsigned int.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted TIFF file, causing the `tiffcrop` tool to crash due to the FPE.
- Application Crash: Due to the division by zero error or integer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted TIFF file: The attacker must provide a specially crafted TIFF file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the `tiffcrop` utility.
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted TIFF file as input to the `tiffcrop` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious tiff file to the tiffcrop utility.
- No special user privileges are required for exploitation.
- The attacker can be remote as long as they can get the crafted TIFF file to be processed by vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in LIBTIFF version 4.4.0.
- The issue was addressed by:
  - Implementing a clamp function `_TIFFClampDoubleToUInt32` which prevents truncation by clamping the double to the maximum uint32_t value.
  - Adding a check for integer overflow in `tiffcrop.c`.
- Several products from NetApp were found to be affected by this vulnerability.
- Debian, and Fedora also released updates to address this vulnerability.
