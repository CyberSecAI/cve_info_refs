Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-2946:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `vim_vsnprintf_typval` function.
- The issue arises when the `'tagfunc'` option is set and the function deletes the buffer, leading to the use of freed memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free. After memory is freed by the tag function, the code attempts to use it, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition due to the application crash resulting from the use-after-free. 
- Other unspecified impact can not be excluded.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack is triggered when a specific tag is used, and the `'tagfunc'` option is set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to set the `'tagfunc'` option to a custom function that deletes a buffer used in tag processing.
- An attacker must be able to trigger the execution of a tag command that results in the vulnerable code path being reached, using a tag which is processed by the attacker-controlled tagfunc.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves making a copy of the tag name before using it when the tagstack may change.
- The provided commit also includes a test case to verify the fix.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Vim version 9.0.246.
