Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize a parameter before including it in the HTML attribute of a backend page. Specifically, the `component` parameter is output directly into an HTML attribute without escaping.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, stealing sensitive information or other actions within the userâ€™s session, as the injected script runs in the same security context.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious payload injected into the `component` parameter. The vulnerable page is located within the WordPress admin panel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site to click on the malicious crafted link. This is typically achieved via social engineering. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is reflected.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `component`.
*   The vulnerable page is `wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-hide-cdn`.
*   The provided proof of concept is: `http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-hide-cdn&component=%22+style%3Danimation-name%3Arotation+onanimationstart%3Dalert%28/XSS/%29+x`
