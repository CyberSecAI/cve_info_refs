{
  "CVE-2022-2132": [
    {
      "Root cause": "A flaw exists in the vhost implementation of DPDK. When a Virtio-net header is split across more than two descriptors, the `copy_desc_to_mbuf` function incorrectly calculates the available buffer space (`buf_avail`).",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect calculation of available buffer space in `copy_desc_to_mbuf` when a Virtio-net header spans multiple descriptors."
      ],
      "Impact": "A malicious guest/container can cause a denial of service on the hypervisor/host by exhausting all available mbufs. This is achieved by sending packets with a specially crafted vhost header that spans more than two descriptors.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest VM or container can send a crafted vhost header",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to send network traffic from a guest virtual machine or container and needs to be able to manipulate the layout of a vhost header spanning multiple descriptors."
    },
    {
      "Root cause": "The descriptor chains which are smaller or equal to the Virtio-net header size were not being discarded, leading to issues during mbuf allocation.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate handling of descriptor chains smaller or equal to header size."
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of Service by exhausting mbuf resources due to processing packets without sufficient data.",
       "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest VM or container can send packets with descriptor chains smaller than or equal to the header size.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to send network traffic from a guest virtual machine or container."
