- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter (`bulkCategoryList`) before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious link containing the XSS payload within the `bulkCategoryList` parameter and tricking a user into accessing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious link and convince a user to click on it. The user must be logged into the WordPress admin panel.
