Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Business Central application in Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7 does not limit the number of unsuccessful login attempts.
*   The application also does not enforce strong password policies, lacking complexity or minimum length requirements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Brute-force vulnerability:** The lack of login attempt limits allows attackers to repeatedly try different username/password combinations.
*   **Weak password policy:** The absence of password complexity requirements makes it easier for attackers to crack user passwords.
*   **No account lockout:** The system doesn't lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful brute-force attacks could lead to unauthorized access to the Business Central admin console.
*   Compromise of admin accounts can allow attackers to perform malicious activities within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote network access to the Business Central application login page.
*   Use of automated tools to launch brute-force attacks against the login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attacker needs network access to the Business Central application login page.
*   Attacker needs the capability to make repeated login attempts.
*  An attacker does not need special privileges to attempt a brute-force attack

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of account lockout and rate limiting of login attempts on the Business Central admin console, combined with weak password policies. This allows an attacker to repeatedly attempt login attempts until they are successful.
