- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Fast Flow plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its Widget settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to perform malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to create/edit a dashboard with an HTML widget and insert a malicious payload in the title or description field of the widget. The XSS is triggered when viewing the Dashboard page (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=fast-flow).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or higher.
