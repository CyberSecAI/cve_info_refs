The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability found in a Gym Management System, specifically within the "Exercises" module after logging into the backend.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete data within the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the 'exer' GET parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and send HTTP requests containing malicious SQL code within the 'exer' parameter. The attacker needs to have access to the backend of the application, after logging in.

The content also includes example SQLmap attack payloads:

- **Error-based injection**: `exer=26'||(SELECT 0x77616550 WHERE 7593=7593 AND (SELECT 2167 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7171767171,(SELECT (ELT(2167=2167,1))),0x716b787071,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a))||'`
- **Time-based blind injection**: `exer=26'||(SELECT 0x737a4e63 WHERE 5129=5129 AND (SELECT 8000 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ZYTF))||'`

These payloads show how an attacker can use SQL injection to extract information or cause delays in server responses. The content also identifies the web application technology as Apache 2.4.39, PHP and PHP 7.3.4 and back-end DBMS as MySQL >= 5.0.
