Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles the `FOLL_FORCE` flag in conjunction with shared memory (shmem/tmpfs) mappings, specifically after the introduction of commit `9ae0f87d009c` ("mm/shmem: unconditionally set pte dirty in mfill_atomic_install_pte").  This commit caused Page Table Entries (PTEs) to be marked dirty unconditionally in certain scenarios. This, combined with the `FOLL_FORCE` flag, allows a user to bypass write protection on shared memory pages even when they do not have write permissions for the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect handling of `FOLL_FORCE`:** The `FOLL_FORCE` flag, intended for specific use cases like debugging or RDMA, was not properly restricted, allowing it to bypass write protections in copy-on-write (COW) mappings when the PTE was marked as dirty.
*   **Unconditional dirty bit setting:** The commit `9ae0f87d009c` unconditionally marked PTEs as dirty, which exposed the vulnerability when combined with the `FOLL_FORCE` flag.
*   **Bypass of write permissions:** The vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to modify the contents of a shmem/tmpfs file even if they lack write permissions on the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary file modification:** An unprivileged user can modify the contents of shared memory files, including executable files, without proper permissions. This could lead to privilege escalation or other malicious activity.
*   **Dirty COW-like behavior:**  The vulnerability is described as similar to the Dirty COW vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195), but restricted to shared memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shared memory (shmem/tmpfs) access:** The vulnerability is exploitable on shared memory files within `shmem` or `tmpfs` filesystems.
*   **Userfaultfd (UFFD) and `FOLL_FORCE`:** The vulnerability is triggered by using `UFFDIO_CONTINUE` to map a shmem page read-only while also setting the PTE dirty. This is then combined with the `FOLL_FORCE` flag (which can be triggered via `follow_page()`, such as when pinning pages via RDMA) to bypass write protections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged user:** The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user on the system.
*   **Access to shared memory:** The attacker needs to have access to a shared memory file on the system.
*   **Kernel with `CONFIG_USERFAULTFD=y`:** The vulnerable kernels need to be compiled with `CONFIG_USERFAULTFD=y` which enables userfaultfd.
*   **Vulnerable kernel version:** Linux kernel versions >= 5.16 (specifically x86-64 and aarch64) are vulnerable due to the problematic commit, before the patch is applied. Linux versions < v5.19 can revert the problematic commit as a fix, while >=v5.19 require the full patch to address the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to x86-64 and aarch64 architectures.
*   The fix involves removing the `FOLL_COW` flag and adjusting how write protections are handled with `FOLL_FORCE`, relying on the `PageAnonExclusive()` flag.
*   The patch also fixes how the softdirty flag and uffd-wp are handled to prevent bypassing of user fault handlers.
*  The patch addresses the vulnerability by relying on the PageAnonExclusive() flag for making COW decisions and triggering write faults in appropriate situations, and removes the dependency of FOLL_FORCE on PTE being dirty.
