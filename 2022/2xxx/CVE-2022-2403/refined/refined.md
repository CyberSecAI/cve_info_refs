Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-2403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The private key of the cluster's external certificate was incorrectly stored within the `oauth-serving-cert` ConfigMaps in the `openshift-config-managed` and `openshift-console` projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credentials Leak:** The private key was exposed.
- **Insecure Storage:** Storing the private key in a ConfigMap that is accessible to authenticated users is insecure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised Web Traffic:** A malicious authenticated user or service account could read the `oauth-serving-cert` ConfigMap. This would allow them to compromise web traffic secured using the exposed certificate's private key.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** By having access to the private key, an attacker could potentially intercept and decrypt traffic meant to be protected by the compromised certificate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user or service account within the OpenShift Container Platform.
- **ConfigMap Access:** The attacker needs to be able to read the `oauth-serving-cert` ConfigMap in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account or service account in the vulnerable OpenShift cluster.
- The attacker must have permissions to view the aforementioned ConfigMap resource.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.9 and 4.10.
- Fixes for this issue were released in RHSA-2022:5664 (for 4.10) and RHSA-2022:5879 (for 4.9).
- The upstream fix is located at: `https://github.com/openshift/cluster-authentication-operator/pull/573`
- The private key was stored in `oauth-serving-cert` ConfigMaps.
