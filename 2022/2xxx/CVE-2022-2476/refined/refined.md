Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2022-2476:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `main()` function of `cli/wvunpack.c` at line 911.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference. The code attempts to dereference a pointer that can be NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is a crash (segmentation fault) of the `wvunpack` command-line tool.
- There is no code injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation requires a crafted WavPack file (`poc.wv`).
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing the crafted file with the `wvunpack` command-line tool, specifically with a crafted command-line including the `-m` flag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute the `wvunpack` command-line tool.
- The attacker must provide a malicious `.wv` file and crafted command line options.
- The attacker must have access to the vulnerable system to execute the command.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in `wvunpack.c` at line 911.
- The issue was reported by `xiaoxiaoafeifei` on GitHub.
- A fix was implemented by `dbry` by checking for a NULL pointer before dereferencing.
- The fix also sanitized custom extensions to be alphanumeric only.
- The vulnerability is not considered highly critical from a security standpoint as it only results in a crash and doesn't allow code injection.
- The issue affects `wavpack` versions prior to the fix.
- Fedora updates have been released to address the vulnerability.
