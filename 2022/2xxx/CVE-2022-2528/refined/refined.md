- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient permission checks when uploading packages to the built-in feed after re-indexing packages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control. A service account with only `FeedView` permission can upload packages to the built-in feed, which should require higher privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a service account that should only have read access to a feed can upload malicious or unwanted packages.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with a service account with `FeedView` permission and access to the Octopus Deploy server can upload a package to the built-in feed after a re-indexing event.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a service account with `FeedView` permission and be able to access the Octopus Deploy server. The vulnerability is triggered after package re-indexing occurs.
