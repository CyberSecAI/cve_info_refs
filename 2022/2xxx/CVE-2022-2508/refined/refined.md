- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Verbose error messaging in Octopus Server reveals the existence of resources in a space that the user does not have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure through resource validation in error messaging.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially discover the existence of resources within an Octopus Server space they do not have permissions to access.
- **Attack vectors:** By attempting to access resources, a user with insufficient permissions can trigger error messages that reveal resource existence.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a user of the Octopus Server but lacks the required permission to access specific resources in order to exploit this vulnerability.
