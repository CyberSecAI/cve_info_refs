## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Titan Anti-spam & Security < 7.3.1 - Protection Bypass due to IP Spoofing

### Description

The plugin does not properly checks HTTP headers in order to validate the origin IP address, allowing threat actors to bypass it's block feature by spoofing the headers.

### Proof of Concept

The function wantispamp\_get\_ip() is vulnerable to IP spoofing because of the general usage of $\_SERVER['HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR']
curl -i -H 'X\_FORWARDED\_FOR: 0.0.0.0' https://example.com
