Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Connectivity Explorer application's improper handling of XML files containing "Live Points". Specifically, the application does not treat these files as untrusted data, leading to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core issue is that the application deserializes data from XML files without proper validation. This allows an attacker to embed malicious code within the XML.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the contents of the XML file, allowing the attacker to introduce malicious elements or properties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the user's computer within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted XML File:** The primary attack vector involves creating a specially crafted XML file that exploits the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Craft a Malicious XML File:** The attacker needs the capability to create a specially crafted XML file containing malicious code.
- **User Interaction:** The user must explicitly open the crafted file using the vulnerable Connectivity Explorer application. Clicking/double-clicking on the file will not trigger the vulnerability.
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability has an attack vector of "Local" and does not require any privileges to be exploited.
