The content is related to CVE-2022-2338.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Softing Secure Integration Server administration interface is accessible via plaintext HTTP protocol, allowing an attacker to intercept sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cleartext transmission of sensitive information. The HTTP requests may contain the session cookie, which can be captured and used to authenticate to the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially bypass authentication by capturing the session cookie through a machine-in-the-middle attack.

**Attack vectors:**
A machine-in-the-middle attack on the network where the vulnerable server is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be positioned on the network to intercept the unencrypted HTTP traffic. The attacker must also trick a user into sending a request.
