The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Lana Downloads Manager" WordPress plugin, specifically an arbitrary file download vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin allows users with "Contributor" permissions or higher to specify a file path/name in the "File (URL)" input field when creating a new "lana_download" post, without proper validation or sanitization. This allows them to download arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file download vulnerability
- Insufficient input validation/sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can download sensitive files from the server, such as `wp-config.php`, which contains database credentials and other sensitive information.
- Information disclosure

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users with at least "Contributor" privileges.
- The attacker needs to create a new "lana_download" post.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with "Contributor" or higher privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin panel.
