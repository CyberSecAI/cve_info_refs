Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2536:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The provided content directly references CVE-2022-2536 and contains information about the vulnerability, its root cause, impact and other details. Therefore the provided information is related to this CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin fails to properly validate settings during the `tp_translation` AJAX action. Specifically, the plugin's "Who can translate" setting is ignored if the "autotranslate" feature is enabled and the HTTP POST parameter `sr0` is greater than 0. The faulty validation resides in `wp/transposh_db.php`.

   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
     - **Improper Authorization (CWE-863):** The core issue is that unauthenticated users can bypass intended restrictions on who can submit translations, allowing them to modify site content.

   - **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can:
      - Influence the data shown on the site by adding new translations.
      - The vulnerability only affects new translations.

   - **Attack vectors:**
      - Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `tp_translation` and the `sr0` parameter set to a value greater than 0 and other translation parameters.
        - Example parameters: `action=tp_translation&ln0=en&sr0=1&items=1&tk0=translation&tr0=translation`

   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
      - The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
      - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the site.

   - **Additional Notes (from the researcher):**
      - When installed, Transposh comes with the option to configure "Who can translate" under the "Settings" tab. However, this setting is ignored when autotranslate is enabled and the `sr0` parameter is larger than 0.
      - This is a separate issue from CVE-2022-2461.
