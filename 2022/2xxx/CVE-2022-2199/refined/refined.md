The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-2199.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The main web server of the MiCODUS MV720 GPS tracker has a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-site scripting (CWE-79)

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could gain control by tricking a user into making a request, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker crafts a malicious request that, when processed by the vulnerable web server, injects and executes malicious scripts within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or web request and convince a user to execute it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The complexity of the attack is considered high, as it requires user interaction and specific crafting of the malicious request.
