**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Accept Stripe Payments" does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "Currency Symbol" setting of the plugin. This injected script will be executed when a user views a product that uses the modified currency.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
