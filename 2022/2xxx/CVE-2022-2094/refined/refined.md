- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied URL parameters before outputting them on the page. Specifically, the `search_job` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `search_job` parameter, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when a user visits the manipulated link. This usually requires the victim to click a link or be redirected to it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice a victim to click it.
