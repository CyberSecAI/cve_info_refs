  "CVE-2022-2990": {
    "description": "An incorrect handling of the supplementary groups in the Buildah container engine might lead to the sensitive information disclosure or possible data modification if an attacker has direct access to the affected container where supplementary groups are used to set access permissions and is able to execute a binary code in that container.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an omission in the specification for Linux container runtimes. When a user logs in, their primary group is duplicated and added to the list of supplementary groups. However, container runtimes do not duplicate the primary group in the list of supplementary groups within the container. This behavior allows a program running inside a container to drop its primary group.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of supplementary groups in container engines",
      "Failure to duplicate primary group in supplementary group list within containers",
       "Missing requirement in the Open Container Initiative Runtime Specification leading to inconsistent implementations",
       "Use of set-group programs to drop primary group"

    ],
    "impact": "An attacker, with the ability to execute code inside a container, can create a set-group program and set the group to one of the user's supplementary groups. When this program runs, the user's primary group is dropped. If negative group permissions are in place, the program can access files or resources that the user was not intended to access, leading to information disclosure and/or data modification.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Gaining the ability to execute code within a container.",
       "Creation and execution of a set-group program to drop the primary group.",
        "Exploitation of negative group permissions on target files."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the affected container and manipulate files within it.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in multiple container runtimes due to a missing explicit requirement in the Open Container Initiative Runtime Specification, that dictates how the primary group should be handled within the list of supplementary groups. This caused implementations to not duplicate a user's primary group in the list of supplementary groups inside containers."
