Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities addressed in the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The commit fixes three stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These likely stem from improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data that's later displayed in the application.
*   **Formula Injection:** A formula injection vulnerability was present in the Excel export functionality. This means that user-controlled input could be interpreted as an Excel formula, potentially leading to malicious code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Output Sanitization/Encoding:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization/encoding of user-provided content before displaying it in the application. This allowed attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application's interface (stored XSS).
*   **Lack of Input Validation for Excel Export:** The Excel export functionality did not adequately validate or sanitize the input being used in the generated Excel file, thus leading to the formula injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute in the browsers of other users who view the affected content.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** This could lead to session hijacking where an attacker gains control over another user's session.
    *   **Data Theft:** Attackers could steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   **Malicious Redirects/Content:** Redirecting users to attacker controlled sites or display malicious content
*   **Formula Injection:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the machine of the user opening the Excel file, potentially leading to data compromise and remote control of the user's machine
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use Excel formulas to steal data from the user opening the file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   **User Input Fields:** Attackers likely injected malicious JavaScript code into input fields (likely text areas or other fields that take user input) which were stored in the database and later displayed to other users without proper sanitization.
*   **Formula Injection:**
    *   **Excel Export Functionality:** The attacker likely crafted specific input that, when included in an exported Excel file, would be interpreted as a formula.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   **Ability to Submit Data:** The attacker needs to be able to input data into the vulnerable application via the exposed input vectors.
    *   **User Context:** The attacker would need to have access to the application to be able to use the vulnerability to attack other users.
*   **Formula Injection:**
    *   **Access to Application:** The attacker needs access to the application and the ability to trigger the Excel export functionality.
    *   **Input Injection:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious formula input into the application's system (such as through a form field).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message explicitly mentions that all versions of the software below `0.77.0` are insecure for production use.
*   The commit includes changes to multiple files, including javascript files, and package files, which indicates changes to both the client and server side code.
*   The patch includes sanitization of HTML content before being used in a tooltip, which indicates that sanitization was missing from previous versions of the code.
*   The patch includes sanitization of user input before it is used in an excel export.
