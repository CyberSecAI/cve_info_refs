Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities addressed in the commit `e606b674a2b7564407d89e38a341d72e22b14694`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The commit message explicitly mentions "fixes three critical stored XSS vulnerabilities". The code changes suggest that the vulnerability was related to how user-provided data was being rendered in the UI, specifically in the `labels` of charts and also within tooltips.
*   **Formula Injection:** The commit also mentions "fixes a formula injection vulnerability in the Excel export functionality". This suggests that user-controlled data was being passed to the Excel export function without proper sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious formulas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Output Encoding:** The code was not properly encoding user-supplied data before rendering it in the HTML context. Specifically, the code was directly using `task._id` to display labels. This allowed the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code in the labels, which could execute when the page is viewed by another user.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code did not sanitize or escape user-provided data before embedding it in the Excel export function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   **Data theft:** An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code in the browser of other users, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    *   **Account hijacking:** If session cookies or tokens are compromised, an attacker might be able to impersonate a legitimate user.
    *   **Malware distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious sites or use the compromised page to serve malware.
    *   **Defacement:** An attacker can modify the content of the page.
*   **Formula Injection:**
    *   **Data exfiltration:** An attacker could use injected formulas to extract sensitive data from the exported data by using external references
    *   **Remote code execution:** Depending on the Excel configuration and user interaction, this could lead to the execution of arbitrary code in the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker would need to find a way to input malicious content into the task or labels fields (or whatever user input was being used to generate the chart labels). Once the malicious content is stored in the database and subsequently rendered, the exploit triggers when other users visit a page containing the vulnerable component.
*   **Formula Injection:** The attacker would need to inject malicious formulas through the task or some other field that ends up in the excel export.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to input the malicious string/code, either through a project creation form or an edit form.
*   **Formula Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to input malicious content into the exported excel spreadsheet, either through a project creation form or an edit form.

**Code Changes (Highlights)**

*   **Chart labels:** The code changes show that the way the chart labels are handled has been modified:
    *   `labels: templateInstance.topTasks.get().map((task) => task._id),` was changed to `labels: templateInstance.topTasks.get().map((task) => $('<span>').text(task._id).html()),` to sanitize the input
*   **Tooltips:** The code changes show that the way the tooltips are handled has been modified:
    *   `return <span class="js-tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="left" title="${value}">${value}</span>`
        was changed to
        `const sanitizedValue = $('<div/>').text(value).html()`
         `return <span class="js-tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="left" title='${sanitizedValue}'>${sanitizedValue}</span>`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message highlights that this is an "important security release" and recommends migrating to version 0.77.0 or higher.
*   The vulnerability was reported by `@saharshtapi`.

This commit appears to address multiple security issues, and the provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.

**Summary of Security Fixes:**

*   The commit addresses three stored XSS vulnerabilities and a formula injection vulnerability.
*   The XSS vulnerabilities were mitigated by sanitizing user-provided data in chart labels and tooltips.
*   The formula injection vulnerability was mitigated by sanitizing the exported data.
*   The fixes are included in version 0.77.0 of the software.
