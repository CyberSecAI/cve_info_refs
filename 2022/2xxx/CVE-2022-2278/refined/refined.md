- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate, sanitize, and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A high privilege user such as an admin can perform stored XSS attacks. The XSS will be triggered when accessing the settings page again.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious javascript code in the plugin's settings, using a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=featured-image-from-url`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) with the ability to access the plugin's settings page. This attack requires the `unfiltered_html` capability to be disallowed.
