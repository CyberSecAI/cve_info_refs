| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2116923#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-08-09 14:37:17 UTC  ``` The podman packages version podman-1.6.4-32.el7_9 as released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHSA-2022:2190 ([https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2190](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A2190)) included an incorrect version of podman that was missing multiple bug and security fixes. One of the fixes regressed in that update was the fix for [CVE-2020-8945](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-8945), that was previously corrected in the podman packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHSA-2020:2117 ([https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2117](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A2117)). The [CVE-2022-2738](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-2738) was assigned to this security regression and it is specific to the podman packages produced by Red Hat.  The original issue - [CVE-2020-8945](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-8945) - could possibly be used to crash or cause potential code execution in Go applications that use the Go GPGME wrapper library, under certain conditions, during GPG signature verification.

The Go wrapper is used during the interaction of container images and GPG signatures; for example when pulling an image from a registry and verifying it's signature.  The gpgme Go wrapper however does not mark the data structures or pointers to be kept alive by the Go run time. During the execution of the gpg binary, it is possible for the Golang garbage collector to free the referenced C structures whilst it is still required.   When the gpg binary finishes executing, the gpgme C library is now using/referencing released memory - resulting in a use-after-free scenario.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1795838#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-03-10 12:22:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2  Via RHSA-2020:0689 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0689](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0689)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1795838#c31)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-03-10 16:31:52 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
