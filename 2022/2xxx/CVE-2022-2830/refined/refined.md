- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data in the message processing component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application processes messages containing serialized data without proper validation, leading to the deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can pass unsafe commands to the environment. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker sends malicious crafted messages to the vulnerable component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target system (Adjacent) and does not require any prior authentication.
