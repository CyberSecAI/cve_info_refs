```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `img_upload.php` script in URVE Web Manager allows arbitrary file uploads without sufficient validation, using the filename directly. This allows an attacker to bypass the file extension check.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Lack of file extension validation",
    "Direct use of user-provided filename"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution and gaining system privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `img_upload.php` with a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and know the correct path to upload the file."
