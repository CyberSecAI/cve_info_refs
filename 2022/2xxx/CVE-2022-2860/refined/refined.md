Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-2860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "insufficient policy enforcement flaw" within the "Cookies" component of the Chromium browser. This means that the browser isn't properly enforcing the rules or restrictions that should be applied to how cookies are handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Policy Enforcement:** The core issue is that the browser is not adequately enforcing policies related to cookies. This could involve improper checks, missing validations, or logical errors in how cookie permissions and restrictions are managed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability could lead to a security compromise, though the specific impact is not detailed. The "insufficient policy enforcement" could potentially enable malicious websites or actors to bypass intended restrictions, possibly leading to unauthorized access, modification, or exfiltration of sensitive cookie data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves malicious websites or scripts leveraging the insufficient policy enforcement to improperly handle cookies. This could happen when a user visits a specially crafted website or interacts with compromised web content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to deliver malicious content to a user's browser, likely by hosting a malicious website or compromising a legitimate one. The attacker would not need specific capabilities other than the ability to deliver the malicious content and trigger the flawed cookie handling logic.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
* The fix for this issue is included in Chromium version 104.0.5112.101.
