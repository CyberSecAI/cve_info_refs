## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 91.11 and Thunderbird 102

Announced
June 28, 2022
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 102
* Thunderbird 91.11

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*
*Note*: While [Bug 1771084](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1771084) does not represent a specific vulnerability that was fixed, we recommend anyone rebasing patches to include it. 102 branch: Patch [1](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/82e3067ad2e7) and [2](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/6e4639dc3614). 91 Branch: Patch [1](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/72bca7a337e4) and [2](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/befef01949f2) (Despite saying Parts 2 and 3, there is no Part 1)

#### [#CVE-2022-34479: A popup window could be resized in a way to overlay the address bar with web content](#CVE-2022-34479)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan
Impact
high
##### Description

A malicious website that could create a popup could have resized the popup to overlay the address bar with its own content, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.
*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2022-34470: Use-after-free in nsSHistory](#CVE-2022-34470)

Reporter

##### Description

Session history navigations may have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2022-2226: An email with a mismatching OpenPGP signature date was accepted as valid](#CVE-2022-2226)

Reporter
Nickolay Olshevsky
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when the signature was created. When displaying an email that contains a digital signature, the email's date will be shown. If the dates were different, then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having an invalid signature. If an attacker performed a replay attack, in which an old email with old contents are resent at a later time, it could lead the victim to believe that the statements in the email are current. Fixed versions of Thunderbird will require that the signature's date roughly matches the displayed date of the email.

#### [#CVE-2022-34481: Potential integer overflow in ReplaceElementsAt](#CVE-2022-34481)

Reporter
Ronald Crane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In the `nsTArray_Impl::ReplaceElementsAt()` function, an integer overflow could have occurred when the number of elements to replace was too large for the container.

#### [#CVE-2022-31744: CSP bypass enabling stylesheet injection](#CVE-2022-31744)

Reporter
Gertjan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An attacker could have injected CSS into stylesheets accessible via internal URIs, such as resource:, and in doing so bypass a page's Content Security Policy.

#### [#CVE-2022-34472: Unavailable PAC file resulted in OCSP requests being blocked](#CVE-2022-34472)

Reporter
Laurent Bigonville
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP requests would have been blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown.

* [Bug 1770123](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1770123)

#### [#CVE-2022-34478: Microsoft protocols can be attacked if a user accepts a prompt](#CVE-2022-34478)

Reporter
Gijs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `ms-msdt`, `search`, and `search-ms` protocols deliver content to Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Thunderbird), so in this release Thunderbird has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them.
*This bug only affects Thunderbird on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Manfred Paul via Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an object prototype was corrupted by an attacker, they would have been able to set undesired attributes on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code execution.

Reporter

Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Thunderbird 91.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2022-34478: Microsoft protocols can be attacked if a user accepts a prompt](#CVE-2022-34478)

Reporter
Gijs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `ms-msdt`, `search`, and `search-ms` protocols deliver content to Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Firefox), so in this release Firefox has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them.
*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Gareth Heyes
Impact

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1771381#c0)• 3 years ago |
|  | |

One of the later phases of the Pwn2Own exploit, described in section 3.6 of the writeup, involves session store. By this point, the exploit has managed to contaminate Object.prototype in the JSM compartment by setting an attacker controlled attribute to an attacker controlled value (that was structured cloned).

They were able to leverage this into further control of the parent process because of the code [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/301e9545863b14ff85aa110fabd4274da4593f9d/browser/components/sessionstore/TabAttributes.jsm#70-74):

```
    for (let name in data) {
      if (!ATTRIBUTES_TO_SKIP.has(name)) {
        tab.setAttribute(name, data[name]);
      }
    }

```

This iterates over all of the properties of data, which is yet another Object being used as a map. This kind of for ... in iterates over properties on the prototype, too, so the attacker's values are copied onto the tab being restored, causing further badness.

There's no actual reason we want to copy properties from anything further up the prototype chain, so we could iterate over `Object.entries(data)` instead of `data`. I looked a bit into changing data to a Map, but it looks like it might come from JSON we're storing somewhere so it didn't seem easy to change. (Another place kmag's idea about parsing into JSON without a prototype might have helped.)

I looked over other places in SessionStore that do a for in loop, in case there are other places we could end up copying random junk from the prototype. One of the data structures is [SessionStoreInternal.\_windows](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=symbol:SessionStoreInternal%23_windows&redirect=false). Another is [SessionStoreInternal.\_statesToRestore](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=symbol:SessionStoreInternal%23_statesToRestore&redirect=false). It looks like maybe in SessionStoreInternal.getCurrentState() that attacker controlled values from Object.prototype can end up contaminating the state. I'm not sure how bad that is.

There's also a place where for in is [used to iterate over winData.extData](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/21e50ef42340c421c5ae2df29f2509d17339c239/browser/components/sessionstore/SessionStore.jsm#4285) Maybe this is kind of hopeless, though, because there are lots of places that read from extData, like in getCustomWindowValue.

I guess I'll call this sec-moderate, but that might be a bit high, given that it takes a few other steps to get to this, and there may be plenty of other similar issues lying around.

We could eslint to forbid `for (var k in obj)` - with a bit of work, only if `obj[k]` is also accessed inside the loop, and update all of them to use `Object.entries`. Is there a reason not to, other than "it's work"? I'm not sure how to understand "kind of hopeless" :-)

No, I think we should definitely do that. It's almost always the wrong thing at this point.

I just meant that places like [getCustomWindowValue](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/669329e284f8e8e2bb28090617192ca9b4ef3380/browser/components/sessionstore/SessionStore.jsm#3400-3401) will end up reading data off Object.prototype, even without a for in loop.

Developing an eslint rule to disallow `for .. in` and rewrite into Object.entries might be doable in ~2 days of my time, though I'm not *entirely* sure about the edge cases and potential breakage depending on the intent of the specific for-loop...

I also think it would be good to enforce this. `for..in` not only includes the proto chain, but the engine also has complicated code to deal with properties that are deleted while iterating (and JS engines don't exactly agree on this in some edge cases, as `for..in` predates proper specs). Hopefully frontend code usually doesn't delete while iterating, but still.

I don't know how bad that is.

I think given `aKey` is presumably a hardcoded string in most/all of the consumers of that method, and the property will likely / almost always exist on the object in question, that's probably an almost-non-existent issue. I mean, tbh, at this point it seems that because we've nuked changing Object.prototype in chrome code anyway, there's probably limited gains left from fixing consumer issues around it in JS. But based on Jan's comments, there are other reasons we might want a bug for the eslint rule.

If the above makes sense, mind filing a (public, I guess) bug about this?

(Leaving the needinfo, this is merely a status report. I will conclude whether this is actually doable later)

I've spent a couple of hours this morning to prototype something, however eslint will not be able to identify if the right part of the "for ... in" is an Object at all. Maybe it's fine to also rewrite for all other cases given that ?Object.entries()` is somewhat useful for Arrays too?

I'm also hitting some limitations of their replace-API:

Replacing the left part with something like `[key, value]` and the right part with `Object.keys(...)` is pretty easy, but replacing the body of the loop seems really tricky, as there seems no simple way to nest through all variables (called `Identifiers`) below and replacing occurrences.

I have a prototype at <https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/daa5cbc5dc0fceb246862760f55ee387/2d0c52d54947ba4dc07dd836ce4b67a67d6985d8>, that I will get back to in a couple of days.

For arrays I'd expect us to use a straight for loop (`for (let i = 0; i < ary.length; i++)`) if the index is important, or a for of loop otherwise (`for (let item of someList)`).

Maybe Mark can suggest something?

I wouldn't mind not having an automated fix, but if there are a lot of instances in the tree perhaps not having one won't fly?

I think we also don't want `for-in` loops for arrays. It has the same problems there as it does for objects. `for-of` loops works to iterate over array values, and `ary.keys()` and `ary.entries()` work when you need the indices too.

The replace API is intentionally simple and meant to work only for simple cases. It possibly isn't a good idea to use it for this.

The API is indeed quite simple. I was hoping to get somewhere with their recent [Code Path Analysis support](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/code-path-analysis), but even that seems to tricky.

Meanwhile, I have noticed that we have [too many occurences of for...in loops](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=for+%5C%28%28let%7Cvar%29%3F.%2B+in%5Cs&path=.js&case=false&regexp=true), and I suppose that we don't want to disallow something with a linter if we can't get rid of it automatically.

I suppose we might have to abandon the code-rewriting aspect of this via eslint and should consider a different approach.

Searchfox implies only around a quarter of those are production code, and the rest are tests. I think it would need a quick verification test to make sure searchfox results are correct, but maybe we could at least ban `for..in` for production code?

We disallow a lot of things we can't get rid of automatically. That said, if there are too many occurrences to fix by hand, I have a separate rewriting framework I tend to use for large/complicated rewrites that ESLint can't handle.

Does somebody want to file a new bug for this for-in elimination discussion?

Another possible piece of work would be to rewrite this session store code to not use Objects as maps everywhere. That might be a bit of work though.

Can you tell me some more about that separate rewriting framework?

I'm not sure how useful it would be to someone else, but I've used it for a bunch of large rewrites, adding features when they were necessary: <https://github.com/kmaglione/m-c-rewrites>

At this point it may make more sense to use `jscodeshift`, but I started having to do rewrites when our code wasn't actually standards-compliant, and even after that I couldn't find a framework that I was actually happy with.
