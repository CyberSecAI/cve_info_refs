The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, focusing on changes related to tooltip handling within the Fava project. The commit message states: "create tooltip contents in a xss-safe way". This suggests that the commit is addressing a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability by changing how tooltip content is created and displayed. The changes involve modifying the way text content is added to tooltips from directly setting the `innerHTML` property which could execute malicious scripts, to creating DOM elements (`Text`, `em`, `br`) and appending them to tooltips to avoid XSS issues. This commit directly relates to the description of CVE-2022-2589 which is a placeholder for vulnerability description retrieval, as it shows the code changes made to address XSS.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The original code used `innerHTML` to set the content of tooltips. This method can introduce XSS vulnerabilities if the tooltip content comes from an untrusted source, such as user input or data from an external API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the use of `innerHTML` for rendering dynamic content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into tooltips, which would then be executed in the user's browser. This can result in the attacker gaining control of the user's session, stealing sensitive information, or performing other malicious actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting malicious content into data that populates tooltips, such as descriptions, account names, or labels. This could be achieved through manipulation of data sources or other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the data that is used to generate the tooltip content. This could involve injecting malicious data into application's datastore, manipulating API responses or compromising other external services.

**Changes made:**
The commit replaces string based `innerHTML` assignments with the DOM manipulation APIs. The changes include:
- Replacing the use of `innerHTML` with DOM manipulation methods for creating tooltip content.
- Creating `Text`, `em` and `br` elements for constructing tooltips in a safe way.
- Modified the `tooltipText` functions in `bar.ts`, `line.ts`, `ScatterPlot.svelte`, `Treemap.svelte`, and `tooltip.ts` to return an array of DOM elements (`TooltipContent`) instead of HTML strings.
- Updated tooltip action in `tooltip.ts` to use `replaceChildren` instead of `innerHTML`.
