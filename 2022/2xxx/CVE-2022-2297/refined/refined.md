{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application system does not properly validate the file type, format, and content during file uploads, allowing attackers to upload malicious script files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted file upload vulnerability that leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The application fails to validate file extensions, content, and prevents directory traversal. It allows uploading of arbitrary files like .php, .jsp, or .asp.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the server, leading to the potential to obtain application system permissions and potentially full server access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the file upload functionality in the user update section.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the user update functionality. The attacker can upload the file without any authentication."
