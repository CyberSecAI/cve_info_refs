The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2100.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Page Generator plugin does not properly sanitize and escape its settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (like admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges. The vulnerability is triggered by saving malicious input in the "Terms" field when adding or editing a keyword in the Page Generator settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative or other high privilege access to the WordPress dashboard.
