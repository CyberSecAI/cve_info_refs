Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-2897:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper link resolution before file access (also known as 'link following') in Measuresoft ScadaPro Server and Client. The software does not properly validate links before accessing files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-59:** Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'). This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate file paths by using symbolic links or similar mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating file access through improper link resolution, an attacker with low privileges can potentially gain higher privileges. This is because the system may follow manipulated links to access or execute files that are normally beyond the attacker's access level.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local Access: The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   File System Manipulation: The attacker needs to create or modify links within the file system that the vulnerable software accesses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a user account on the system running ScadaPro Server or Client.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker may start with low-level privileges but can escalate them through exploitation.
*   **File System Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the software accesses files and how to manipulate file system links to redirect file access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of ScadaPro Server and Client.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 7.8, with the vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   There are no known public exploits for this specific vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

**Mitigations:**

*   Measuresoft is working on a mitigation.
*   Users should only use project files from known and trusted sources.
*   General recommendations include not opening attachments or clicking links in unsolicited emails, and following general social engineering attack prevention advice provided by CISA.
