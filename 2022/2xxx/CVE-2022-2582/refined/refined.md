Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-2582:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The AWS S3 Crypto SDK was sending an unencrypted hash of the plaintext alongside the ciphertext as a metadata field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of an unencrypted hash of the plaintext.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the metadata could potentially brute-force the plaintext, compromising the confidentiality of the data.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker who has access to the metadata of the encrypted objects stored in S3 could use the exposed hash to try to recover the plaintext.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the metadata of the encrypted objects.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the AWS SDK for Go prior to v1.34.0.
- AWS has addressed the issue by blocking the metadata field where the hash was being sent. However, older versions of the SDK might still be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is associated with the `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3/s3crypto` package.
- The fix is related to the introduction of `EncryptionClientV2` and `DecryptionClientV2`.
