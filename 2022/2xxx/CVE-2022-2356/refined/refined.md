Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-2356:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file extension filtering in the "User Private Files" WordPress plugin when users upload files.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin allows users to upload files without properly validating or sanitizing their extensions. This means an attacker can upload files with extensions such as `.php`, which can be executed on the server.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing malicious PHP code, an attacker can gain control of the web server and potentially the entire system.
    *   **Website Compromise:** The attacker can use the compromised server to perform various malicious activities, such as defacing the site, stealing data, or launching attacks on other systems.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered through the file upload functionality of the WordPress plugin.
    *   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates a cURL request to exploit the lack of file type filtering by providing a malicious payload named `exploit.php`, along with a manipulated `docext` field, and sends this request to the admin-ajax.php endpoint.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Subscriber+ Role:** A user with at least the "Subscriber" role on the WordPress site is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Access to front page to get nonce:** The attacker needs access to the front page to find a nonce value needed for the exploit.
    *   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to send and modify HTTP requests using tools like cURL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a cURL request.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.3 of the "User Private Files" plugin.
*   The content is more descriptive and provides a PoC than the official CVE description.
