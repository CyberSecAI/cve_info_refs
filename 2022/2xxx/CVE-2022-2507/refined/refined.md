Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a weak Content Security Policy (CSP) header. This allows user-supplied input to be rendered into the webpage without proper sanitization.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of a strong CSP header. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  The advisory explicitly states "it is possible to render user supplied input into the webpage".

*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the webpage.  This could lead to various impacts, including data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the website. The advisory itself notes that it is a low severity vulnerability.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious user-supplied input into the webpage. This can happen through forms, URL parameters or any other user controlled input rendered by the application.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code by providing input to the application, and have that input rendered on the webpage. This means any input channel that the application uses, that is not properly sanitized, is a potential attack vector.
