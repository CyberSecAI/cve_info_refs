      "root_cause": "The commit message indicates fixes for three stored XSS vulnerabilities and a formula injection vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored XSS",
        "Formula Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "The stored XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. The formula injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the spreadsheet environment.",
      "attack_vectors": "The XSS vulnerabilities are likely exploited via user-provided input that is not properly sanitized before being stored and rendered in the application. The formula injection vulnerability is likely exploited via crafted input in an export function that gets interpreted as an Excel formula.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into data that is later displayed or exported by the application. For XSS, this involves injecting script tags or malicious code into input fields that are later rendered without sanitization. For formula injection, this involves injecting malicious formula-like text into input fields that are exported into an excel file."
