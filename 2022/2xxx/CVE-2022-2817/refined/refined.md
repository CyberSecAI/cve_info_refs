Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2817:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap use-after-free in the `string_quote()` function located in `src/strings.c`. Specifically, it occurs when an error message is generated in the `assert_fails` function, and this message is then used as an argument to another function (`pattern_match()`) that may free the memory of the error message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The `assert_fails` function was not properly handling the error message, resulting in a use-after-free condition when this message was used in the `pattern_match()` function. The memory of `actual` string is freed, but the value is used again.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a crash or denial of service due to use-after-free.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when calling the `assert_fails()` function with a specific set of arguments that cause an error.
- This can happen by crafting a vim script that calls `assert_fails` with specific parameters which cause an error.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious Vim script that uses the assert functions in a way that triggers the use-after-free. This could be a user opening a malicious file or a developer executing a malicious test script.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involves making a copy of the error message before passing it to `pattern_match()`. This prevents the use-after-free condition because `pattern_match()` is not working on the freed memory.
- The vulnerability is mentioned as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities fixed in vim version 9.0.213
- The commit 249e1b903a9c0460d618f6dcc59aeb8c03b24b20 on github is the fix for this issue.
