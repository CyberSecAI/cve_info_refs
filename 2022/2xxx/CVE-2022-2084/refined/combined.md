# USN-5496-1: cloud-init vulnerability

29 June 2022

cloud-init could be made to expose sensitive information.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)
* [Ubuntu 21.10](/security/notices?release=impish)
* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [cloud-init](/security/cves?package=cloud-init) - initialization and customization tool for cloud instances

## Details

Mike Stroyan discovered that cloud-init could log password hashes when

reporting schema failures. An attacker with access to these logs could

potentially use this to gain user credentials.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 22.04

* [cloud-init](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cloud-init)
  -
  [22.2-0ubuntu1~22.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cloud-init/22.2-0ubuntu1~22.04.3)

##### Ubuntu 21.10

* [cloud-init](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cloud-init)
  -
  [22.2-0ubuntu1~21.10.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cloud-init/22.2-0ubuntu1~21.10.3)

##### Ubuntu 20.04

* [cloud-init](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cloud-init)
  -
  [22.2-0ubuntu1~20.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cloud-init/22.2-0ubuntu1~20.04.3)

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [cloud-init](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cloud-init)
  -
  [22.2-0ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cloud-init/22.2-0ubuntu1~18.04.3)

In general, a standard system update will make the necessary changes.

Please note that sensitive information may have been logged to remote

logging aggregators as well as to the system journal, and removal of

such information may be required. Similarly, cloud-init configurations

that log in non-default locations may also require the removal of

sensitive information.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Remove schema errors from log ([#1551](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/1551))

```
When schema errors are encountered, the section of userdata in question
gets printed to the cloud-init log. As this could contain sensitive
data, so log a generic warning instead and redirect user to run
cloud-init schema --system as root.
