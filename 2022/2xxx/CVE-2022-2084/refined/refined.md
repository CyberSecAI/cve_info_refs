Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the fact that `cloud-init` was logging portions of user-provided data (user-data) to the logs when schema validation failed. This user-data could contain sensitive information, such as password hashes, which would then be exposed in the logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive user data, specifically password hashes, were being written to logs when schema validation of the provided user-data failed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker with access to the `cloud-init` logs could potentially extract sensitive information, like password hashes, that may lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker would need to have access to the system logs where `cloud-init` errors are logged. This could be achieved in several ways:
    - If the attacker has compromised the system already
    - If the attacker has access to a logging aggregator where the logs are being forwarded

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Access to system logs or log aggregation systems where cloud-init logs are stored.
- The ability to trigger an invalid schema configuration on a system using `cloud-init`

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves modifying the `cloud-init` code to not log the specific user-data that causes schema validation failures. Instead, a generic warning message is logged, directing users to run `cloud-init schema --system` to identify the errors.
- This ensures that sensitive data is no longer exposed in the logs during schema validation.
- The vulnerability was present in multiple versions of Ubuntu, across different LTS and non-LTS releases.
- Mitigation instructions include updating `cloud-init` to the patched versions and manually removing sensitive data from logs if they had previously been exposed.

This vulnerability is addressed by commit `4d467b14363d800b2185b89790d57871f11ea88c` on the canonical/cloud-init repository.
