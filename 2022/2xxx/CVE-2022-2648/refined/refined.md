The provided content is related to a SQL injection vulnerability in a hotel management system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure handling of user-supplied input when querying the database. Specifically, the `room_id` parameter is directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection: The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. This vulnerability arises from the direct inclusion of user-supplied input (specifically the `room_id`) in SQL queries without sufficient sanitization or the use of parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Database information disclosure: An attacker can exploit this to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, personal information, and financial data.
*   Data modification: The attacker may be able to modify or delete data within the database.
*   Arbitrary code execution: Depending on the database server configuration, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the database.

**Attack vectors:**
*   HTTP POST request: The injection point is located in the POST request body, specifically within the `room_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious queries.
*   The attacker can use automated tools like SQLMap to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
* The provided content includes output from the SQLmap tool demonstrating successful exploitation through multiple injection techniques such as boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query injection
* The SQL injection is specifically located in a PHP-based hotel management application using MySQL database.
* The vulnerable parameter is `room_id` which takes an integer value.
