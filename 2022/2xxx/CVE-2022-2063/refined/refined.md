Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-2063:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content is related to a commit that removes user information from the webhook context in NocoDB. This suggests that the vulnerability addressed is related to the exposure of sensitive user data in webhook payloads. While the CVE description is not available, the content strongly suggests a vulnerability where user information was unnecessarily included in webhook context, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the inclusion of user information (user ID, email, roles) within the context/payload of webhooks. This information was being made available to webhook URLs.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unnecessary exposure of user details in webhook payloads. This includes user ID, email, and roles, which are considered sensitive information.
   - **Unintentional Data Sharing:** The system was designed to include user information in webhooks, even when it was not required by the webhook's intended function.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Exposure of Sensitive User Data:** An attacker could potentially gain access to user IDs, email addresses, and roles by controlling or observing a webhook.
   - **Privacy Violation:** The disclosure of personal information could lead to privacy violations for the affected users.
   - **Potential for Further Attacks:** User information obtained this way could be used as part of further attacks, such as phishing or social engineering.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Webhook Monitoring/Interception:** An attacker could monitor network traffic to intercept webhook payloads containing user information if the webhook URL is not adequately secured (e.g., via HTTPS).
   - **Compromised Webhook Endpoint:** If the webhook destination (e.g., the URL) is compromised, the attacker could receive the user information sent in the webhook.
   - **Manipulation of Webhook Settings:** An attacker who gains access to the NocoDB system might be able to create or modify webhooks to have them send data to a controlled endpoint.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to Trigger a Webhook:** The attacker needs the ability to trigger an event that fires the vulnerable webhook.
   - **Network Access (for interception):**  For network monitoring/interception, the attacker requires network access to the traffic generated by NocoDB.
   - **Compromised Webhook Endpoint:** An attacker who already has control over a system where webhooks are sent, could observe the data.
   - **NocoDB System Access (for webhook modification):** An attacker with privileged access to NocoDB could change webhook settings to redirect information to an external controlled endpoint

**Technical Details:**

- The commit `269a19c2ad89a0e8a7596498e3806ff2ec1040c2` specifically removes user-related context from the webhook payload.
- The changes include modifications to `webhookHelpers.ts` and `BaseModelSqlv2.ts`.
- In `webhookHelpers.ts`, the `parseBody` function is modified to no longer include user information, and the `axiosRequestMake` function is updated to remove user data from the webhook context.
- Documentation is also updated to reflect the change in webhook context variables in `webhooks.md`.

**Summary:**
The provided content details a vulnerability where NocoDB included sensitive user information in webhook payloads. The patch removes this user information from the webhook context, thus resolving the information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker could have exploited this issue by intercepting or controlling a webhook endpoint to obtain user details.
