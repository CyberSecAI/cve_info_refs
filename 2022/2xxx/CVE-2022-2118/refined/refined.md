The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2118.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin `404s` does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input when creating/editing 404 pages, allowing for stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize the `Please enter the 404 URL in here:` field, which allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view the affected page. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's admin interface where a user with high privileges (like an administrator) can create/edit a 404 page and insert malicious JavaScript in the '404 URL' field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges to access the plugin's settings page and create/edit 404 pages.
