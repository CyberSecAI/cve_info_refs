## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Duplicate Page < 1.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to Settings ->Duplicate Page -> Duplicate Page Settings and enter the XSS payload into
the Duplicate Page Link Text input field.
2. Click Save Changes.
3. You will observe that the payload successfully got stored into the
database and when you are triggering the same functionality at that time
JavaScript payload is executing successfully and we are getting a pop-up.
4. Payload Used: "onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//
