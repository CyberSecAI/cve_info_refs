- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "Duplicate Page Link Text" input field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with high privileges (such as an admin) can inject the XSS payload via the plugin settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges.
