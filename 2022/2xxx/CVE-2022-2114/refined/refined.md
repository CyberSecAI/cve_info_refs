- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-provided data in the table settings, specifically within the "Signature Text" textarea.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Signature Text" setting. When a page/post with the embedded table is viewed, the injected script will execute, potentially leading to actions like session hijacking, phishing attacks, or website defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to create or edit a table within the plugin and insert the malicious script within the signature text field. The XSS is triggered when the table is embedded in a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges (or other roles capable of modifying table settings) within the WordPress instance.
