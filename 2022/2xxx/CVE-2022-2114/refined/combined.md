## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Data Tables Generator by Supsystic < 1.10.20 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Table settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a table, go to its settings, enabled the Signature (in Main Settings tab) and put the following payload in the Signature Text textarea: <svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered in a page/post where the table is embed
