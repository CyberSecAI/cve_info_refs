**CVE Relevance:**

The provided content relates to a commit in the `microweber/microweber` repository, specifically `60eef7494211d1c458228c321e986edeaa401a58`, which includes a change to `src/MicroweberPackages/App/Http/Middleware/XSS.php`. This commit modifies the HTTP methods that are subject to XSS cleaning, from `POST` to `POST` and `PATCH`. This change suggests the fix of a potential vulnerability related to missing XSS sanitization on PATCH requests.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability likely stems from the fact that the XSS sanitization middleware was only applied to `POST` requests.  `PATCH` requests were not being sanitized, and thus were vulnerable to XSS attacks through input parameters.
*   **Weakness:** Missing XSS Sanitization on `PATCH` requests.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application through `PATCH` requests. These scripts could then be executed in the context of other usersâ€™ browsers, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious user could send crafted `PATCH` requests to the application with malicious script embedded in the request parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker would need to be able to send `PATCH` requests to the application.
    *   The attacker would need to know which parameters in the `PATCH` request are vulnerable (i.e. are reflected on a page without proper sanitization).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit diff clearly shows the change:
    `if ($request->isMethod('post') and !empty($input)) {`  
    is changed to  
    `if (($request->isMethod('post') or $request->isMethod('patch')) and !empty($input)) {`
*   This indicates that the fix for the potential XSS was to ensure that both POST and PATCH requests are subject to sanitization using `HTMLClean()`.
*   The `HTMLClean` class is used to sanitize the input, which likely strips HTML and javascript from user input.
