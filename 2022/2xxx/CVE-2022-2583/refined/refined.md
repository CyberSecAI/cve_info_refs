Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2583

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A race condition in the `github.com/ntbosscher/gobase/auth/httpauth` package. The issue stems from the way the middleware was being applied. Instead of cloning the server struct for each request, it was using the same instance causing concurrent access issues during request handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Race Condition:** Concurrent requests could access and modify the shared `server` struct simultaneously, leading to unpredictable behavior.
*   **Incorrect HTTP Request Routing:**  Due to the race condition, the wrong handler might be invoked for a given request because the `next` handler was being modified concurrently.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Incorrectly routed requests. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access or unexpected functionality of the application.
*   Denial of Service: In severe race conditions, the application might become unstable or crash.
*   Data Leakage: Depending on the specific routes, sensitive information might be exposed due to routing to unexpected handlers.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending concurrent HTTP requests to the affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application that uses the vulnerable `github.com/ntbosscher/gobase/auth/httpauth` package. No special privileges are needed.

**Technical Details:**
*   The fix involves cloning the `server` struct for each request before passing it to the handler chain.
*   The vulnerable code used a shared `server` instance.
*   The fix is implemented in commit `a8d40bce9c429d324122d18c446924dab809e812`.
