Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper validation of session token parameters within the Octopus Server. Specifically, the session cookie's date was not being validated against server policies, leading to indefinite session validity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Session Expiration:** Session tokens could remain valid indefinitely due to the lack of proper validation against server-defined policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially maintain unauthorized access to the Octopus Server for extended periods if they obtain a valid session token. This could allow them to perform actions as the compromised user, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the exploitation of a valid session token. If an attacker can obtain a session token, they could use it indefinitely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to obtain a valid session token. The document does not specify how this is achieved, but the vulnerability allows for indefinite use if a token is obtained by an attacker.
