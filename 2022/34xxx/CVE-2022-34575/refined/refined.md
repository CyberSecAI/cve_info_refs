Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `fctest.shtml` page of the Wavlink WiFi repeater's firmware. This page, intended for factory testing, is accessible without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The `fctest.shtml` page does not require any authentication, allowing unauthorized users to access it.
- **Information Disclosure:** The page exposes sensitive information about the router.
- **Syslog access:** The syslog.shtml page stores user operations without proper authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain key information about the router which could potentially include configurations, passwords, or other sensitive details. This can be used for further attacks or to compromise the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** An attacker can access the vulnerable page by simply visiting the URL `http://<router_ip>/fctest.shtml`. 
- **Unprotected Syslog:** An attacker can access `syslog.shtml` to view user operation logs without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Wavlink WiFi repeater or have network access to the device. They do not need to have any special credentials, as the page is accessible without authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in firmware package version `RPTA2-77W.M4300.01.GD.2017Sep19`.
- The provided PoC screenshots show the output of the `fctest.shtml` and `syslog.shtml` pages.
