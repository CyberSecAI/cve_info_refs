Based on the provided text, here is the information regarding CVE-2022-34804:

**CVE-2022-34804**

*   **Vulnerability:** API Key stored in plain text.
*   **Affected Plugin:** OpsGenie Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.9 and earlier
*   **Root cause:** The OpsGenie Plugin stores API keys unencrypted in its global configuration file (`com.opsgenie.integration.jenkins.OpsGenieNotifier.xml`) and in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller. Also, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the respective configuration forms.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    *   The plugin does not encrypt API keys before storing them on the Jenkins controller.
    *   The plugin transmits the API keys in plain text during configuration.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission (job `config.xml` only) or access to the Jenkins controller file system (both).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the API keys in the configuration files.
    *   An attacker with Item/Extended Read permission can view the API keys in job `config.xml` files.
    *   An attacker may intercept the API key during transmission via the configuration forms.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Access to the Jenkins controller file system.
    *   Item/Extended Read permissions.
    *   Network position to intercept plain text data transmission.
