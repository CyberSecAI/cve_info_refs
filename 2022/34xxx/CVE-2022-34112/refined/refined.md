The provided content describes a vulnerability in DataEase, specifically an issue where users with low privileges can uninstall plugins via the API.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on the `/api/plugin/uninstall` endpoint. The application allows users with lower privileges to call this API, which should be restricted to administrative roles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks for the plugin uninstallation API endpoint. This allows low-privilege users to execute privileged actions.
- **API Vulnerability**: The API endpoint `/api/plugin/uninstall` is exposed without proper permission checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Plugin Removal:** A low-privilege user can uninstall any plugin, which can disrupt services, remove functionality, or potentially cause application instability.
- **Denial of Service**: The removal of crucial plugins can lead to a denial of service scenario, making the application or specific features unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker only needs network access to the DataEase application and a valid low-privilege user account.
- **Direct API Call:** The attacker makes a direct API call to the `/api/plugin/uninstall` endpoint with the plugin ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs a valid account with basic user privileges within the DataEase application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the DataEase server.
- **API Knowledge**: The attacker must know the structure of the API request (endpoint and parameters) needed for uninstallation.

The vulnerability was fixed in version v1.11.2 of DataEase.
