Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-34960:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how MikroTik's RouterOS handles mount points in its container implementation. Specifically:

1.  **Symlink Resolution in Mounts:** When creating mount points, the system resolves symbolic links in the source (`src`) path *before* mounting, relative to the host filesystem. This allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions by using symlinks to point to different locations.
2.  **Symlink Resolution in Destination:**  The destination (`dst`) parameter also resolves symlinks relative to the host filesystem, effectively making it possible to mount files from inside the container to arbitrary locations on the host system.
3.  **`noexec` bypass with symlinks:** While mount points are created with `noexec` flag which prevents direct execution of mounted binaries, this flag is bypassed when the mounted file is a symbolic link that points to an executable on a partition without the `noexec` flag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:**  By manipulating mount points, an attacker can overwrite files on the host system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can mount a symlink over a system executable to a malicious executable located in a container, causing the malicious code to run when the target system executable is triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution on the host RouterOS device, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Access to the file system enables attackers to read sensitive files.
*   **Device Manipulation:** Ability to control the device by running arbitrary commands.
*   **Network Pivoting:** From a compromised router, further attacks may be launched to internal networks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Container Mount Points:** The primary attack vector is through the container mount point functionality.
*   **Malicious Container:** The attacker needs to have access to the RouterOS device to create a container with specific mount points to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to RouterOS Device:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the RouterOS device to create and configure containers and mount points.
*   **Ability to Create a Container:** The attacker must be able to create a container and install a malicious payload inside the container.
*   **Knowledge of RouterOS Filesystem:** The attacker requires some knowledge of the RouterOS filesystem to select a target executable and the location of files within the container.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a critical issue allowing an attacker to leverage the container mount point feature in RouterOS to achieve arbitrary code execution on the host system. By crafting malicious mount points that leverage symlink resolution, an attacker can bypass the `noexec` restrictions and execute arbitrary code, leading to complete device compromise. This vulnerability highlights how the interaction of multiple features in an unexpected way can lead to a security vulnerability.
