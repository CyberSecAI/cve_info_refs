- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in Dell BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The BIOS does not properly validate the size of input parameters when handling System Management Interrupts (SMI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local authenticated attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution in System Management RAM (SMRAM).
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a larger-than-expected input via an SMI to a vulnerable parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be local and authenticated (high privileges) on the system. The attacker needs to have the ability to send SMIs.
