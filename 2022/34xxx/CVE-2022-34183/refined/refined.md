Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-34183:

**CVE-2022-34183**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Agent Server Parameter` plugin, along with several other plugins, does not escape the name and description of the parameter types they provide. This lack of escaping allows for the injection of malicious code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input for parameter names and descriptions, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the Jenkins UI. Successful exploitation can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, and performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
*  **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by configuring a job with a malicious parameter using the affected plugin and having it displayed on a page (e.g. "Build with Parameters" page).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs Item/Configure permission to configure a job with a malicious parameter, and for those parameters to be displayed on another page that is not hardened against XSS (e.g. "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters").

**Affected Plugin:**
* `agent-server-parameter` plugin versions 1.1 and earlier.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory notes that Jenkins core has implemented mitigations for similar vulnerabilities on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2. However, the plugins themselves need to be updated to prevent this type of XSS.
*   A fix is not available for this plugin.
