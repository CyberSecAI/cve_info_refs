The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34114.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `/dataset/table/sqlPreview` endpoint in DataEase allows arbitrary SQL code execution. This is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `sql` parameter of the `/dataset/table/sqlPreview` endpoint.
- **Lack of Authorization:** Normal users with standard privileges can call the vulnerable endpoint, indicating a lack of proper access control or authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL code execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting critical data.
    - Privilege escalation: Elevating their privileges within the database server, potentially leading to database server takeover.
    - System compromise: If the database server is not properly isolated, it could be leveraged to gain access to the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is the `/dataset/table/sqlPreview` API endpoint accessible over the network.
- **HTTP POST request:** The attacker sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the DataEase instance.
- **Authentication:** Although a normal user can trigger the vulnerability, it implies the attacker must have at least a valid user account in DataEase.
- **Knowledge of API endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/dataset/table/sqlPreview`).
- **Knowledge of Data Source ID:** The attacker needs to know a valid `dataSourceId`, which can be retrieved by checking the data sources.
- **Ability to craft a malicious SQL query:** The attacker needs to be able to create malicious SQL payloads.
