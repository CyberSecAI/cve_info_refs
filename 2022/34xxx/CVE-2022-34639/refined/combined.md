| Our co-simulation framework found the decoder has an incorrect behavior when execute a `fence.i`/`fence` with non-zero rd field.  As discussed before [719](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/719), `fence`/`fence.i` should ignores immediate, rs1, rd field. We found the patch [724](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/pull/724) does not fix this bug.  The checking after the patch still throws an exception for non-zero rd and rs1:   [cva6/core/decoder.sv](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/909d85a56cc5ace65765a63d7ed56b7ac2026f99/core/decoder.sv#L238-L239)  Lines 238 to 239 in [909d85a](/openhwgroup/cva6/commit/909d85a56cc5ace65765a63d7ed56b7ac2026f99)   |  | if (instr.stype.rs1 != '0 || instr.stype.imm0 != '0 || instr.instr[31:28] != '0) | | --- | --- | |  | illegal\_instr = 1'b1; |      According to the The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume I: Unprivileged ISA:  FENCE: The unused fields in the FENCE instructions—rs1 and rd—are reserved for finer-grain fences in future extensions. For forward compatibility, base implementations shall ignore these fields, and standard software shall zero these fields. FENCE.I: The unused fields in the FENCE.I instruction, imm[11:0], rs1, and rd, are reserved for finer-grain fences in future extensions. For forward compatibility, base implementations shall ignore these fields, and standard software shall zero these fields.  In the following test case, there is a valid `fence.i` at 0x80000194, whose rd field is 1, and a `fence` with non-zero rd at 0x80000198. cva6 still throws exceptions for them.  ``` [cva6] Exception @     68600, PC: 0000000080000194, Cause: Illegal Instruction, [cva6]                                 tval: 000000000000120f [spike] core   0: 0x0000000080000194 (0x0000120f) fence.i [error] PC SIM 0000000080000194, DUT 0000000080000004 [error] INSN SIM 0000120f, DUT 34202f73 [CJ] Commit Failed  ```  [cva6-4.zip](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/8833868/cva6-4.zip)  @LuminaDCIX helps reproduce the problem |

| Hm, based on the current spec it seems that:   [cva6/core/decoder.sv](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/909d85a56cc5ace65765a63d7ed56b7ac2026f99/core/decoder.sv#L238-L239)  Lines 238 to 239 in [909d85a](/openhwgroup/cva6/commit/909d85a56cc5ace65765a63d7ed56b7ac2026f99)   |  | if (instr.stype.rs1 != '0 || instr.stype.imm0 != '0 || instr.instr[31:28] != '0) | | --- | --- | |  | illegal\_instr = 1'b1; |     Is not needed anymore to preserve forward compatibility. I can't seem to find how `rd` is factored into the equation. Would you mind trying to delete the above lines and re-run the testcase? |

from [#900](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/900), this patch passed the testcase in the report.

As specification suggests: `For forward compatibility, base implementations shall ignore these fields, and standard software shall zero these fields`, remove the check on related fields.

Sorry, something went wrong.
