The provided content relates to a bug in the cva6 core decoder related to `fence` and `fence.i` instructions, which is addressed by the fix in pull request #923.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The decoder incorrectly checks the `rs1`, `imm0` and bits `[31:28]` of the instruction for `fence` and `fence.i` instructions. According to the RISC-V specification, these fields should be ignored for forward compatibility. The decoder was incorrectly throwing an "illegal instruction" exception when these fields were non-zero.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core decoder was not compliant with the RISC-V specification for the `fence` and `fence.i` instructions, leading to unexpected exceptions. Specifically, the decoder was checking fields that should have been ignored, causing valid instructions to be flagged as illegal.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is that a program using valid `fence` or `fence.i` instructions with non-zero `rd` and/or `rs1` fields (or other unused fields), which are supposed to be ignored according to the spec, will cause an illegal instruction exception. This could lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior in the system.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker could write software that uses the `fence` and `fence.i` instructions with non-zero `rd` and/or `rs1` fields, triggering the decoder error.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the affected system. This code could be running as part of a user application or at any other privilege level.

The fix involved removing the checks on the unused fields of the `fence` and `fence.i` instructions in the core decoder. The specific lines that were removed were:
```
if (instr.stype.rs1 != '0 || instr.stype.imm0 != '0 || instr.instr[31:28] != '0)
    illegal_instr = 1'b1;
```
This ensures that the decoder correctly ignores these fields, as per the RISC-V specification.
