Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically in the "Comment\_nickname" field during user registration. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where the attacker can inject JavaScript code that is then permanently stored within the application's database.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable website and affected users.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Impersonation:** The attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious pages and steal their credentials.
- **Malware distribution:** The attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to deliver malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Registration:** The attack vector is through the user registration process on the demo site (<https://demo.cms.feehi.com/>).
- **Comment Nickname Field:** Specifically, the "Comment\_nickname" field in the registration form is vulnerable to the injection of malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs to know how to craft a basic XSS payload.
- **User Account Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to register an account on the target website.
- **Publicly Accessible Application:** The vulnerable application must be publicly accessible for the attacker to trigger the vulnerability through registration.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported and fixed by the developers.
- The fix involved restricting usernames to only allow alphanumeric characters and the hyphen symbol, preventing the inclusion of script tags.
- The issue was discussed on GitHub issue #61 for the feehi/cms repository.

In summary, a Stored XSS vulnerability existed in the FeehiCMS application due to insufficient input validation during user registration. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via the comment nickname field.
