{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of integrity checks when downloading code within the UEFI bootloader provided by New Horizon Datasys Inc.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Security Feature Bypass",
       "Lack of Integrity Check on Downloaded Code"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the Secure Boot feature and execute arbitrary code during the boot process before the operating system loads. This could lead to persistent malware installation, loading of arbitrary kernel extensions, and evasion of OS-based and EDR security defenses.",
    "attack_vectors": "A custom installer can be used to trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerable bootloader, when launched by the custom installer, will execute the unsigned code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to load the vulnerable bootloader via a custom installer. This would typically require physical access or the ability to control the boot process of the target system."
