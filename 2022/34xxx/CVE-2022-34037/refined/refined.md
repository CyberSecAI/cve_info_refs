The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34037.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to incorrect parsing of URIs within the `rewrite` function in `modules/caddyhttp/rewrite/rewrite.go`. The function attempts to identify the path, query string, and fragment parts of the URI using simple character scanning, but this logic fails when a '#' character appears before a '?' character. This leads to incorrect bounds for slicing the URI string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation and handling of special characters in URIs, specifically '#' and '?'.
-  The code does not account for the possibility of a fragment identifier ('#') appearing before a query string delimiter ('?').

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A specially crafted URI in the `rewr.URI` field can cause a panic due to out-of-bounds slice access, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can provide a crafted URI string with a '#' character appearing before a '?' character in the `rewr.URI` field of a rewrite configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `rewr.URI` parameter of the `Rewrite` directive in the Caddy configuration. This might be possible through direct configuration file manipulation, or if the Caddy configuration is dynamically generated based on user input, depending on the deployment.
