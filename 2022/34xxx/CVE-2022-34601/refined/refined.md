```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `Delstlist` interface when processing the `param` parameter. The `getElement` function is used to split strings, but the size of the buffer (`V7`, which is 16 bytes) is exceeded by the input parameter. The `getElement` function can write up to 64 bytes, leading to the overflow.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Stack-based buffer overflow
- Insufficient bounds checking when splitting strings in the `getElement` function
- The `Delstlist` interface processes a user-supplied parameter, creating an attack vector

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote code execution can lead to a stable root shell without authorization

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint
- The `param` parameter in the request contains a long string that causes a buffer overflow

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network access to the vulnerable device
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface
