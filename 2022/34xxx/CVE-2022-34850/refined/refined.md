The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34850.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the admin username which is used in a command executed by the `sysprintf` function which in turn calls the `system` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection: The `sysprintf` function executes a command constructed using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The username field, while checked for length and allowed characters, does not properly sanitize special characters that are interpreted by the shell, leading to command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the web server. This could lead to:
- Complete system compromise.
- Data exfiltration.
- Installation of malware.
- Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a crafted sequence of requests:
1. A request to `/ajax/webs_uci_set_super_user/` to set a malicious username containing shell injection payloads.
2. A request to `/action/import_authorized_keys/` to upload an arbitrary file. This causes the vulnerable `cp` command to be executed by `sysprintf`, where the malicious username is used, causing command injection

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges to change the username via the `/ajax/webs_uci_set_super_user/` API.
- The attacker must be able to make network requests to the device's web server.
