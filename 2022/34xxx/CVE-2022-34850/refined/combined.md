# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1578

## Robustel R1510 web\_server /action/import\_authorized\_keys/ OS command injection vulnerability

##### October 14, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-34850

##### SUMMARY

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the web\_server /action/import\_authorized\_keys/ functionality of Robustel R1510 3.1.16 and 3.3.0. A specially-crafted network request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Robustel R1510 3.1.16

Robustel R1510 3.3.0

##### PRODUCT URLS

R1510 - <https://www.robustel.com/en/product/r1510-industrial-cellular-vpn-router/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The R1510 is an industrial cellular router. It offers several advanced software features like an innovative use of Open VPN, Cloud management, data over-use guard, smart reboot and others.

The R1510’s web\_server offers an API to add, for the logged users, the SSH authorization keys.

Here is the `/action/import_authorized_keys/` API that manages the imports of the SSH authorization keys:

```
void /action/import_authorized_keys/(Webs *webs)

{
  [...]
      memset(admin_ssh_folder,0,0x40);
      user_username = uci_get("user_management.username");
      snprintf(admin_ssh_folder,0x40,"/home/%s/.ssh",user_username);
      iVar1 = dir_exists(admin_ssh_folder);
      if (iVar1 == 0) {
        sysprintf("mkdir -p %s",admin_ssh_folder);
        sysprintf("chmod 700 %s",admin_ssh_folder);
      }
      iVar1 = scaselessmatch(webs->method,"POST");
      if (iVar1 != 0) {
        for (current_file = (WebsKey *)hashFirst(webs->files); current_file != (WebsKey *)0x0;
            current_file = (WebsKey *)hashNext(webs->files,current_file)) {
          sysprintf("cp -rf \"%s\" %s/authorized_keys",
                    ((current_file->content).WebsUpload)->temp_filename,admin_ssh_folder);              [1]
        }
      }
     [...]
}

```

This function will fetch the admin-chosen username, create the `/home/<ADMIN_USERNAME>/.ssh` folder and set the right permissions for it. Then it will iterate over the request’s files and import those using the instruction at `[1]`. This instruction uses the `sysprintf` function that will first execute the `vsnprintf` function with the provided arguments, then use the output as argument for the `system` function. So, the instruction will copy the uploaded file from the temporary upload location to the `/home/<ADMIN_USERNAME>/.ssh/authorized_keys` folder, executing `cp -rf \"<TEMP_LOCATION>\" /home/<ADMIN_USERNAME>/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

The web\_server offers the possibility to change the admin username. The API responsible to do so is `/ajax/webs_uci_set_super_user/`:

```
undefined4 /ajax/webs_uci_set_super_user/(Webs *webs)

{
  [...]

      new_username = websGetVar(webs,"new_username",0);
      is_not_empty = string_is_not_empty(new_username);
      if ((is_not_empty == 0) ||
         (does_not_match = string_reg_verify(new_username,
                                    "^[a-zA-Z0-9@\\#\\.\\$\\*\\!][a-zA-Z0-9@\\#\\.\\$\\*\\!\\-]{4,32 }$"
                                   ), does_not_match == 0)) {                                           [2]
        old_password = websGetVar(webs,"old_password",0);
        is_error = string_reg_verify(old_password,
                                  "^[a-zA-Z0-9@\\#\\.\\$\\*\\!][a-zA-Z0-9@\\#\\.\\$\\*\\!\\-]{4,32}$ "
                                 );
        if (is_error == 0) {
          new_password = websGetVar(webs,"new_password",0);
          is_error = string_reg_verify(new_password,
                                    "^[a-zA-Z0-9@\\#\\.\\$\\*\\!][a-zA-Z0-9@\\#\\.\\$\\*\\!\\-]{4,32 }$"
                                   );
          if (is_error == 0) {
            current_password = uci_get("user_management.password");
            is_error = string_matched(old_password,current_password);
            if (is_error == 0) {
              websWrite(webs,"{name: \"%s\", reason: \"%s\"}","old_password","not match");
            }
            else {
              is_error = string_is_not_empty(new_username);
              if (((is_error == 0) ||
                  (is_error = uci_set("user_management.username",new_username), is_error == 0)) &&      [3]
                 (is_error = uci_set("user_management.password",new_password), iVar1 == 0)) {
                res = "OK";
              [...]
}

```

This function will take the request’s `new_username` parameter and checks at `[2]`, if it is in a valid format. The same goes for the password parameters. Then, at `[3]`, the `new_username` is committed as the new one.

Because the `new_username` valid format is `^[a-zA-Z0-9@\\#\\.\\$\\*\\!][a-zA-Z0-9@\\#\\.\\$\\*\\!\\-]{4,32 }$`, it is allowed to use special characters that can be interpreted in the unix shell. So, crafting a specific admin username and then using the `/action/import_authorized_keys/` API would lead to a command injection at `[1]`.
