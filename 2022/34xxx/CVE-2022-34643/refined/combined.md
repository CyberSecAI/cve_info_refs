| Yes, but the priority of the misaligned exception is also wrong, which is outside of the load\_slow\_path function. |

| I agree that this is wrong, and a (exceptionally clearly described) problem. It's been a long time since I added that trigger code. I'm not sure how to raise the trigger priority while minimizing the performance impact.  I might have time to look at this in a few weeks, when I'm back from vacation. |

When the slow path occurs, don't check for alignment in load_fast().

I haven't tested different endianness.
