- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal vulnerability exists in the Intel(R) NUC Pro Software Suite.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal, which allows an attacker to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local user can potentially escalate privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a local authenticated user on the system running the vulnerable software.
