This document details multiple vulnerabilities found in DW Spectrum server software and MegaPix IP cameras by Digital Watchdog. However, there's no mention of any specific CVE ID like CVE-2022-34537. Therefore, I will extract information about the vulnerabilities listed within the document, but note that it is UNRELATED to CVE-2022-34537.

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

**DW Spectrum Server Software (ver 4.2.0.32842):**

*   **Weakness:** Information Disclosure.
    *   **Root Cause:**  An API call exposes internal paths, IP addresses, OS version, and architecture.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the URL `http://<SERVER IP>:7001/api/moduleInformation`.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive internal information is disclosed.

**MegaPix IP Camera (firmware A7.2.2\_20211029):**

*   **Weakness:** Information Disclosure (CWE-201)
    *   **Root Cause:** Web files expose internal paths, scripts, and software versions through unauthenticated URLs.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the following URLs:
        *   `http://192.168.1.80/plugin_info_list.xml`
        *   `http://192.168.1.80/plugin/plugin_web.conf`
        *   `http://192.168.1.80/plugin/port.conf`
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive internal information is exposed.

*   **Weakness:** Information disclosure and session hijacking (CWE-201)
    *   **Root Cause:**  Core logs reveal session tokens after a 500 error is generated.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Generate a 500 error by accessing `192.168.1.80/cgi-bin/result?msubmenu=event&action`.
        2.  Retrieve the core file from `192.168.1.80/cgi-bin/core`.
        3.  Extract session token information from the error event in the core log.
        4. Use session token information to log in to admin pages.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing unauthorized access to admin pages.

*   **Weakness:** Command injection on `curltest.cgi`
    *   **Root Cause:**  Inadequate sanitization of input parameters in `curltest.cgi`.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Injecting shell commands into `test[]` parameters (e.g., `smtp_addr`, `smtp_port`, `sender`, `receiver`, `id`, and `pass`) via a POST request to  `http://192.168.1.80/cgi-bin/admin/curltest.cgi`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires authentication.

*   **Weakness:** Command injection on `addacph.cgi` (CWE-94)
    *   **Root Cause:**  Inadequate sanitization of input parameters in `addacph.cgi`.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting shell commands into the `event`, `id`, `pluginname`, `name`, and `evt_id` parameters via a GET request to `http://192.168.1.80/cgi-bin/admin/vca/bia/addacph.cgi`.
    *    **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.
   *    **Required Capabilities:** Requires authentication.

*   **Weakness:** Command injection on `license_tok.cgi` (CWE-94)
    *   **Root Cause:**  Inadequate sanitization of POST parameters in `license_tok.cgi`.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Injecting shell commands into `guid`, `license_value`, and `plugin_info` parameters via a POST request to `http://192.168.1.80/cgi-bin/admin/vca/license/license_tok.cgi`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires authentication.

*   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `bia_oneshot.cgi` (CWE-79)
    *   **Root Cause:**  Lack of sanitization of the `blob` parameter.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code via the `blob` parameter in a GET request to  `http://192.168.1.80/cgi-bin/admin/vca/bia/bia_oneshot.cgi`.
    *   **Impact:** Persistent XSS allowing execution of arbitrary Javascript in the victim's browser.
     *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires authentication.

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**

The gist.github.com content reports multiple vulnerabilities in DW Spectrum server software and Digital Watchdog MegaPix IP cameras, including information disclosure, session hijacking, command injection, and XSS. The vulnerabilities include both unauthenticated and authenticated attacks.
