{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The timer task and RX task become locked when there are frequent and continuous Wi-Fi connection attempts with four-way handshake failures in Soft AP mode.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Deadlock",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The device becomes unresponsive due to a deadlock between the timer and RX tasks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Frequent and continuous Wi-Fi connection attempts with four-way handshake failures in Soft AP mode.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range to initiate connection attempts with the target device running in Soft AP mode."
