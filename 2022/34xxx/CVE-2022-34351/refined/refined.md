- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to improper access control within IBM QRadar SIEM, allowing a non-tenant user with a specific domain security profile to view data from other domains.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure due to a flaw in the domain-based access controls within QRadar SIEM.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A non-tenant user with a specific domain security profile assigned can view sensitive information from other domains, which they should not be authorized to see. This can lead to data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive logs and events.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the QRadar SIEM application interface itself, exploiting the lack of proper tenant data isolation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a non-tenant user with a specific domain security profile assigned in the vulnerable QRadar SIEM instance.
