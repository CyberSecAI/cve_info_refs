The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34171.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper escaping of the `title` attribute of `l:ionicon` (until Jenkins 2.334) and the `alt` attribute of `l:icon` (since Jenkins 2.335) in the HTML output generated for new symbol-based SVG icons. This was introduced in Jenkins 2.321 and LTS 2.332.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The HTML output generated for new symbol-based SVG icons includes the `title` attribute of `l:ionicon` until Jenkins 2.334 and `alt` attribute of `l:icon` since Jenkins 2.335 without further escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the Jenkins UI, potentially leading to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Credential theft
*   Malicious actions performed on behalf of a user
*   Defacement of the Jenkins interface

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code within the `title` or `alt` attributes of SVG icons.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires Job/Configure permission to be able to exploit this vulnerability.
