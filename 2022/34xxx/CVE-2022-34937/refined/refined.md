- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `savepage.php` page is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it lacks token protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick an authenticated administrator into submitting a crafted form which allows them to inject malicious PHP code into CMS pages, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the webserver.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that auto-submits a form to the vulnerable `savepage.php` endpoint. The victim (admin) is tricked into visiting the attacker's page, triggering the malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and trick a logged-in administrator into visiting it. The targeted administrator needs to have the privilege to write PHP code within CMS pages.
