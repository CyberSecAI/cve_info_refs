Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of access control on the `tftp.txt` file in the Wavlink WiFi repeater firmware. This file contains sensitive information, specifically the telnet account password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive telnet account credentials in a plain text file accessible without authentication.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The `tftp.txt` file does not have sufficient access restrictions, allowing unauthorized users to access it via a simple HTTP request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Compromised Device:** An attacker can obtain the telnet password, gaining unauthorized access to the device.
- **Full Control:** Once logged in via telnet, the attacker can gain full control of the device, allowing for malicious activities such as modifying device settings, intercepting traffic, or potentially installing malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers can access the vulnerable `tftp.txt` file directly by sending an HTTP request to the deviceâ€™s IP address, specifically `http://<device_ip>/tftp.txt`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same network as the Wavlink repeater or have network access to the device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker needs no prior authentication to retrieve the sensitive information.

**Additional details:**
- The affected firmware version is identified as `RPTA2-77W.M4300.01.GD.2017Sep19`.
- The provided PoC includes screenshots showing the file contents containing the telnet password.
