The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34187.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `Filesystem List Parameter` plugin not escaping the name and description of the parameter types it provides. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into the Jenkins UI. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser session when they view a page that renders the affected parameters.

**Attack vectors:**

- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by configuring a job with a malicious parameter name or description.
- The malicious code is triggered when users view pages like "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" that display the affected parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Attackers need Item/Configure permission in Jenkins to configure a job to include the malicious parameter name or description.
- The attack is effective if the parameters are rendered in an unescaped fashion on other pages.
