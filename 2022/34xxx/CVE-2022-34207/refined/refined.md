  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2022-34207": {
      "root_cause": "The Beaker builder Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation, and the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing permission check",
         "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP request to a specific form validation endpoint within the plugin. The absence of a POST request requirement allows for CSRF attacks.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires Overall/Read permission and the ability to initiate HTTP requests (e.g., by tricking a user into accessing a malicious link).",
    }
