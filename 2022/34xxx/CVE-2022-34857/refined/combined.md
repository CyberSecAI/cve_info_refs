How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

I am using SP Client Document Manager Premium on a client’s website, and the “Download” link has stopped working on all documents.
I raised an “Urgent” priority ticket with Smarty Pants five days ago regarding this and had no response. I have also tried using Live Chat, but again, no response – despite it saying that Anthony at Smarty Pants was online “Just Now”. I also called the Smarty Pants phone number (508.471.4711) at 11.55am EST today and had to leave a voicemail message, as no one was available to take the call.
Smarty Pants apparently no longer supports this product, despite the premium version costing $75 per year.
I advise that you avoid using SP Client Document Manager Premium and try another plugin.

I am using the free version as it already provides functionalities that are oofered by commercially available ones. Ane even more than some. The availability of the PRO version or separate Add Ons makes this plugin a must have if you need a website that offers a file exchange and management system.
PS. Quick and to the point support as well, even for the free version.

Documents are database tagged, and this is not our need. We requested a refund 3 days after testing, and didn’t get any answer. Support is not working at all…

We replaced an existing document mangement plugin (developer went dark – beware, it’s still being marketed) with this product after doing extensive research. There are very few products of this type out there. Product does what it’s suppossed to. Support is very responsive. Would like to see more email template customization options, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that this product is highly functional.

Exactly what we needed for our company’s internal file sharing site. Extremely easy to use. Just wish that the user groups security addon was included free.
