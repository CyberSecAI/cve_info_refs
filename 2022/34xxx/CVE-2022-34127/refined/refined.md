Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability #1 – Unauthenticated/Authenticated SQL Injection**
*   **Root Cause:** The application stores raw POST data in a global variable (`$_UPOST`) and uses this unescaped data when processing user types and information assigned to tickets, problems, and changes in the helpdesk component, specifically in the `_actors` variable.
*   **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection due to lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to modify the database, add records (like file types), or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/front/change.form.php` with a malicious JSON payload in the `_actors` parameter.
*  **Required Capabilities:** No authentication required for the helpdesk component depending on the configuration.

**Vulnerability #2 – Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution on Cartography Plugin**
*   **Root Cause:** The `/front/upload.php` file in the Cartography plugin uses the `name` parameter from a GET request as the filename and the request body as the file content when the `Content-Type` header doesn't specify multipart.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of sanitization and validation of the filename and file content, allowing for arbitrary file creation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file to the server and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a POST request to `/marketplace/positions/front/upload.php` with a malicious PHP code in the body.
*  **Required Capabilities:** No authentication required.

**Vulnerability #3 – Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) on Glpiinventory Plugin**
*   **Root Cause:** The `/b/deploy/index.php` file calls the `httpSendFile` function with the `file` parameter from a GET request after some filtering that can be bypassed. The function then combines the unfiltered parameter with a default path and uses `readfile()` to output the content of the file.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient sanitization of user-provided input, allowing path traversal.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files or sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to `/marketplace/glpiinventory/b/deploy/index.php` with path traversal sequences in the `file` parameter
*  **Required Capabilities:** No authentication required.

**Vulnerability #4 – Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion on Manageentities and Activity Plugins**
*   **Root Cause:** The `/front/cri.send.php` file, when the `seefile` parameter is set, combines the `file` parameter from the GET request with the document directory (`GLPI_DOC_DIR`) without proper sanitization and uses readfile() to send the file content. The same vulnerability also exists in the `/activity/front/cra.send.php` file of the Activity plugin, but it requires authentication.
*   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate validation of user-supplied file paths, resulting in local file inclusion.
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a GET request to `/marketplace/manageentities/inc/cri.class.php` or `/marketplace/activity/front/cra.send.php` with a crafted `file` parameter containing path traversal sequences and the `seefile` parameter set.
*  **Required Capabilities:** No authentication required for the Manageentities plugin but authentication is required for Activity plugin.

**Vulnerability #5 – Authenticated Limited Local File Read on CMDB Plugin**
*  **Root Cause:**  The `/front/icon.send.php` file in the CMDB plugin combines a user-supplied `file` parameter from the GET request with the document directory (`GLPI_DOC_DIR`) without sufficient sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure handling of user-controlled file paths.
*   **Impact:** Authenticated users can read certain files within the `/files` directory such as log files, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a GET request to `/marketplace/cmdb/front/icon.send.php` with a `file` parameter pointing to a file within `/files`.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Authentication is required.

The Github advisory confirms the LFI in the Manageentities plugin:

**GHSA-4hpg-m8fv-xv3h:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion on Manageentities.
*   **Affected versions:** < 4.0.2
*   **Patched version:** 4.0.2
*   **Description:** It is possible to add Local File Inclusion on Manageentities

**In summary:** The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in GLPI, including SQL injection, Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities across different plugins. The most severe vulnerabilities are the unauthenticated RCE in the Cartography plugin and the unauthenticated LFI in the Manageentities and Glpiinventory plugins, allowing arbitrary code execution and unauthorized file access respectively. The GitHub advisory confirms the LFI in the Manageentities plugin.
