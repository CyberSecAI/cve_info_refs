**CVE-2022-34197**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sauce OnDemand plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected pages.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Item/Configure permissions can configure a job with a malicious parameter name or description. This malicious data is then stored and displayed on pages like "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters," leading to XSS execution when other users view these pages.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs Item/Configure permissions in Jenkins. The attacker also needs to have the malicious parameter listed on a page not hardened against XSS exploitation.
