The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34792.

**CVE-2022-34792:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Recipe Plugin does not perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints. Additionally, the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks and the form validation method doesn't require POST requests. The plugin also allows users to export the full configuration of jobs as part of a recipe.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Missing permission check: Attackers with Overall/Read permission can send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.
    *   XML External Entity (XXE) attack: Attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets or server-side request forgery.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The form validation method does not require POST requests.
    *   Insecure access to job configuration: The plugin allows users to export the full configuration of jobs as part of a recipe, granting access to job configuration XML data, including unredacted encrypted secrets, to every user with Item/Read permission.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Attackers can extract secrets from the Jenkins controller
    *   Attackers can perform server-side request forgery.
    *   Attackers can export the full configuration of jobs as part of a recipe and gain access to job configuration XML data.
    *   Attackers can perform actions by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending a crafted HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parsing the response as XML.
    *   Exploiting the CSRF vulnerability using non-POST requests.
    *   Exporting job configurations through the plugin.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Attackers require Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission check, XXE, and CSRF vulnerabilities.
    *   Attackers require Item/Read permission to export job configuration.
