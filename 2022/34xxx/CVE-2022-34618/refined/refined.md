**CVE-2022-34618:**

*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker must be an authenticated user and create a recipe that includes malicious JavaScript within its description.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have an account on the application and be able to create recipes. The victim can be any user (authenticated or unauthenticated) who views the compromised recipe.
