The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-34178.

Here's the extracted information for CVE-2022-34178:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-34178

**Vulnerable Plugin:** Embeddable Build Status Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 2.0.3 and earlier

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin allows specifying a `link` query parameter that build status badges will link to, without restricting possible values.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the Jenkins UI, potentially leading to:
    *  Session hijacking
    *  Credential theft
    *  Malicious actions performed on behalf of a user
    *  Defacement of the Jenkins UI

**Attack Vectors:**
    * An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a javascript payload in the `link` query parameter of the build status badge URL.
    * The victim is tricked into accessing this malicious URL, causing the javascript payload to execute in their browser session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   * No specific permission is required to craft the malicious link
   * The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link

**Fix:**
   * Embeddable Build Status Plugin should be updated to version 2.0.4, which limits URLs to `http` and `https` protocols and correctly escapes the provided value.
