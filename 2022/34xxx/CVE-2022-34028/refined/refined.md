{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted JavaScript code that leads to a segmentation fault in the njs_utf8_next function when processing a string within the njs JavaScript engine. The crash occurs due to an out-of-bounds read in the njs_utf8_next function which is called when the engine tries to slice a string.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read in njs_utf8_next leading to a segmentation fault.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to a crash of the njs engine (a segmentation fault), which can lead to denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted JavaScript code that triggers the vulnerable string processing logic.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within an environment that uses the vulnerable version of the njs engine."
