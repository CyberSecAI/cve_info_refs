Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Unauthenticated/Authenticated SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses raw, unsanitized data from the `_actors` variable (within POST requests) when processing user types and information related to tickets, problems, and changes in the helpdesk component. The `_actors` parameter is not properly escaped, which allows for SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data before it's used in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the database.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted POST request to `/front/change.form.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `_actors` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. Depending on the GLPI configuration, this can be done unauthenticated or with a valid user account.

**Vulnerability 2: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution on Cartography Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/front/upload.php` file in the Cartography plugin uses the `name` parameter from the query string as the filename for an uploaded file and the request body as the file content when the `Content-Type` header does not contain `multipart`.
*   **Weakness:**  Improper handling of file uploads. Specifically, the filename is taken directly from user input without proper validation, and the file contents are taken from the request body and written directly to the file system.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload arbitrary PHP code to the server, allowing for remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/marketplace/positions/front/upload.php` with the desired filename in the `name` query parameter and the malicious code in the request body.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Vulnerability 3: Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion in Glpiinventory Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The `getFilePart` action in `/b/deploy/index.php` of the `glpiinventory` plugin uses the `file` parameter from a GET request to include a file on the server. The plugin attempts to sanitize the path, but this can be bypassed using path traversal sequences like `../../`.
*  **Weakness:** Improper validation of the file path provided by the user, allowing path traversal.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*  **Attack Vector:** Crafting a GET request to `/marketplace/glpiinventory/b/deploy/index.php` with `action=getFilePart` and a malicious `file` parameter using path traversal sequences to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Vulnerability 4: Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion in Manageentities and Activity Plugins**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `file` query parameter in `/front/cri.send.php` (Manageentities plugin) and `/activity/front/cra.send.php` (Activity plugin) is used to include files on the server. The path is combined with the document directory, and path traversal sequences can bypass intended restrictions.
*   **Weakness:** Improper validation of file paths, allowing path traversal.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a GET request to `/marketplace/manageentities/inc/cri.class.php` or `/marketplace/activity/front/cra.send.php` with a crafted `file` parameter using path traversal sequences.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. The vulnerability in the Manageentities plugin is unauthenticated, while the vulnerability in the Activity plugin requires authentication.

**Vulnerability 5: Authenticated Limited Local File Read on CMDB Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/front/icon.send.php` file in the CMDB plugin allows reading of files under the `/files` directory via the `file` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper access controls on file access.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read specific files within the `/files` directory. This can expose log files and other sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a GET request to `/marketplace/cmdb/front/icon.send.php` with the `file` parameter specifying the file to read.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

In summary, the vulnerabilities discussed include SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution, and Local File Inclusion, with varying degrees of severity and authentication requirements.
