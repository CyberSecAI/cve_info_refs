Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-34305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the Form authentication example of the Apache Tomcat examples web application.
- User-provided data is displayed without proper filtering, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed in the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, stemming from a lack of input sanitization when displaying user-provided data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:**  An attacker could potentially access sensitive information, such as session cookies or other data stored in the user's browser, by executing malicious scripts within the context of the vulnerable web application.
- **Modification of Data:**  The attacker may be able to modify the displayed content or redirect the user to a malicious website, potentially tricking the user into divulging sensitive information or carrying out unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is primarily through the vulnerable Form authentication example within the Apache Tomcat examples web application.
- The attacker would need to provide malicious input that gets rendered without proper sanitization by the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need special privileges or credentials to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N).
- The attacker must be able to inject malicious input into the application that will be rendered in the victim's browser.
- User interaction (UI:R) is required to trigger the vulnerability, meaning a victim has to access a crafted URL or use an input field provided by the application.
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely (AV:N).

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Apache Tomcat: 8.5.0 through 8.5.81, 9.0.30 through 9.0.64, 10.0.0-M1 through 10.0.22, and 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.0-M16.
- NetApp has stated that their products are not affected by this vulnerability, as they do not expose the vulnerable example web application of Apache Tomcat.
- Gentoo Linux is tracking this vulnerability under GLSA 202208-34.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.1 (MEDIUM) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
- There are public discussions regarding this vulnerability.
