        "vulnerability": "A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in signed 3rd party UEFI bootloaders that allows bypass of the UEFI Secure Boot feature. The vulnerable bootloaders can be tricked to bypass Secure Boot via a custom installer (CVE-2022-34302) or an EFI shell (CVE-2022-34301 and CVE-2022-34303).",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the Eurosoft (UK) Ltd bootloader and is due to a lack of integrity checks when downloading code.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Lack of integrity check on downloaded code",
          "Vulnerable UEFI bootloader"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can bypass a system's Secure Boot feature at startup and execute arbitrary code before the operating system (OS) loads. Code executed in these early boot phases can provide persistence to an attacker, potentially loading arbitrary kernel extensions that survive both reboot and re-installation of an OS. It may also evade common OS-based and EDR security defenses.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "EFI shell execution"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute an EFI shell on the target system."
