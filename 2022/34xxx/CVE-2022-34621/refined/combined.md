# Insecure direct object references (IDOR)

In this section, we will explain what insecure direct object references (IDOR) are and describe some common vulnerabilities.

## What are insecure direct object references (IDOR)?

Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. The term IDOR was popularized by its appearance in the OWASP 2007 Top Ten. However, it is just one example of many access control implementation mistakes that can lead to access controls being circumvented. IDOR vulnerabilities are most commonly associated with horizontal privilege escalation, but they can also arise in relation to vertical privilege escalation.

## IDOR examples

There are many examples of access control vulnerabilities where user-controlled parameter values are used to access resources or functions directly.

### IDOR vulnerability with direct reference to database objects

Consider a website that uses the following URL to access the customer account page, by retrieving information from the back-end database:

`https://insecure-website.com/customer_account?customer_number=132355`

Here, the customer number is used directly as a record index in queries that are performed on the back-end database. If no other controls are in place, an attacker can simply modify the `customer_number` value, bypassing access controls to view the records of other customers. This is an example of an IDOR vulnerability leading to horizontal privilege escalation.

An attacker might be able to perform horizontal and vertical privilege escalation by altering the user to one with additional privileges while bypassing access controls. Other possibilities include exploiting password leakage or modifying parameters once the attacker has landed in the user's accounts page, for example.

### IDOR vulnerability with direct reference to static files

IDOR vulnerabilities often arise when sensitive resources are located in static files on the server-side filesystem. For example, a website might save chat message transcripts to disk using an incrementing filename, and allow users to retrieve these by visiting a URL like the following:

`https://insecure-website.com/static/12144.txt`

In this situation, an attacker can simply modify the filename to retrieve a transcript created by another user and potentially obtain user credentials and other sensitive data.

# CVE-2022-34615, CVE-2022-34621, CVE-2022-34623, CVE-2022-34624 – IDOR, User Enum and More (In Mealie)

[gainsec](https://gainsec.com/author/gainsec/ "Posts by gainsec")
[CVE](https://gainsec.com/category/cve/), [Information Security](https://gainsec.com/category/information-security/)
August 19, 2022August 19, 2022

I told you there are more CVEs coming! Getting to the end of this chunk finally! There are only 3 more CVEs I have reserved which are waiting on developer confirmation/responsible disclosure dates to pass.

For more background and other CVEs from this application check out these two posts. [HERE](https://gainsec.com/2022/08/02/cve-2022-34613-cve-2022-34618-cve-2022-34619-xss-file-upload-and-more/) and [HERE](https://gainsec.com/2022/08/02/cve-2022-34625-ssti-rce-mealie/)

Anyway, these were found the same nights as the other ones but we found they only affect version 0.5.5 so not the current version at the time of our testing. So we saw them as less of a priority. Since they were also assigned CVEs figured I’d get a brief overview about them! Again this was with my co-worker at [nVisium](https://nvisium.com/), Bruno Hernández ([GitHub](https://github.com/0xBruno) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-x-hernandez)).

The CVEs are as follows: [CVE-2022-34615](https://cve.report/CVE-2022-34615), [CVE-2022-34621](https://cve.report/CVE-2022-34621), [CVE-2022-34623](https://cve.report/CVE-2022-34623), [CVE-2022-34624](https://cve.report/CVE-2022-34624)

CVE-2022-34615 is self-explanatory. Mealie v0.5.5 was found to support a weak password policy. This makes dictionary or brute force attacks trivial. In this case, one character passwords were allowed.

CVE-2022-34621 is a [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor) vulnerability. Specifically the “user\_id” parameter was vulnerable across all instances of it. This allowed any authenticated user to change the password of any other user (including administrators) as well as change their profile images or whatever else.

CVE-2022-34623 is a user enumeration vulnerability. When attempting to log in, if you put a proper username and an improper password the application takes a significantly longer time to respond compared to a improper user and improper password. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to determine what usernames/emails are registered on the application.

CVE-2022-34624 is a session termination/expiration issue. Specifically the JWT used to download files do not expire after logout or in a reasonable amount of time. This means that any attacker within a Man-In-The-Middle (MiTM) position or anyone with access to the web server logs can reuse the user’s download token to download the file.
