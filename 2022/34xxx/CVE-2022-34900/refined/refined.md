Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-34900:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Parallels Access Agent Dispatcher service loads an OpenSSL configuration file from an unsecured location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element: The service searches for the OpenSSL configuration file in a location where a low-privileged user could place a malicious file. This is an instance of an uncontrolled search path, specifically related to a configuration file.
- Privilege Escalation: The ability to control the loaded configuration file allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: An attacker can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
- Arbitrary code execution:  The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of SYSTEM.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack: The attacker needs to have local access to the machine.
- File system manipulation: Requires the attacker to place a malicious OpenSSL configuration file in the unsecured location.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low-privileged code execution: The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system with low privileges.
- File system write access: The attacker must have the ability to write to the unsecured directory where the vulnerable service looks for its configuration file.
