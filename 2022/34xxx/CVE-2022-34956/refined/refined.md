The provided content describes two time-based SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Kliqqi-CMS project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `$page_size` variable, which is user-controllable, is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Time-based SQL injection in `/load_data_for_groups.php` on line 16.
- Time-based SQL injection in `/load_data_for_topusers.php` on line 30.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. The vulnerability is described as a "blind SQL injection," indicating that the attacker may not receive direct output from the queries but can infer results based on time delays.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts (`/load_data_for_groups.php` and `/load_data_for_topusers.php`), specifically by manipulating the `page_size` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and be able to manipulate the `page_size` parameter in the request. No specific authentication or special privileges are mentioned, implying that the vulnerability may be exploitable by any user who can reach the vulnerable endpoints.
