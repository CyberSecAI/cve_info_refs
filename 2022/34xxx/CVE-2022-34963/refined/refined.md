Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "News Feed" module of OpenTeknik LLC OSSN OPEN SOURCE SOCIAL NETWORK v6.3 LTS, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the location field of a news feed post, allowing an attacker to store malicious JavaScript payloads within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they view the affected news feed post. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing user credentials.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "News Feed" module's location input field.
- An attacker posts a news feed entry and includes an XSS payload in the location field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the OSSN platform.
- The attacker must be able to create a post on the "News Feed".

**Technical Details**
-  The vulnerability is triggered by injecting XSS payloads into the location input field when creating a news feed post.
- The provided payloads are:
    - `<img/&#09;&#10;&#11; src=~ onerror=prompt('Grim-The-Ripper-Team-by-SOSECURE-Thailand')>`
    - `<BODY ONLOAD=alert('Grim-The-Ripper-Team-by-SOSECURE-Thailand')>`
    - `<img src=x onerror=confirm('Grim-The-Ripper-Team-by-SOSECURE-Thailand')>`

**Affected Components/URLs:**
-  `http://ip_address:port/ossn/home` (The News Feed page itself)
-  `POST /ossn/action/wall/post/a` (The endpoint for posting on the wall)
