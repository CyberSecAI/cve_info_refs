Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of URLs in two specific functionalities of OneBlog v2.3.4. The application does not properly validate user-supplied URLs when adding friendly links or using the article porter function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes server-side requests to URLs provided by the user without proper validation. This allows an attacker to control the destination of these requests.
    *   **First SSRF:**  The "Article Porter Module" allows users to specify URLs via the `entryUrls` parameter. The application then makes requests to these URLs.
    *   **Second SSRF:** When adding a friendly link, the application makes a request to the provided URL in the `Logo` parameter. The URL is accessed both during the save operation and when the link is refreshed/accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Intranet Scanning:** Attackers can use these SSRF vulnerabilities to probe internal network services. The attacker can send requests to different ports on internal servers and analyze the response times to determine if a service is active on that port. The difference in response times for open vs closed ports allows the attacker to enumerate open ports on internal infrastructure.
*   **Potential Data Exposure:** While not explicitly stated, SSRF vulnerabilities can potentially be leveraged to access sensitive data on internal servers if the attacker can craft requests to specific resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to log in to the OneBlog system using the default credentials, or a valid account (e.g., `root/123456`).
*   **Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to supply a malicious URL to either the "Article Porter Module" through the `entryUrls` parameter or to the "Link module" through the `Logo` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the OneBlog application, typically through a web browser.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the OneBlog application, either using a valid user account or the default credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability report uses timing analysis to demonstrate how an attacker can determine whether a port is open on an internal server.  An open port returns a response faster than a closed one.
*   The report identifies the specific vulnerable parameters: `entryUrls` for the article porter and `Logo` for the link module.
*   The second reported vulnerability, related to the link module's logo parameter, was initially considered not to be an SSRF, but was later confirmed to be one.

This vulnerability allows for internal port scanning and potentially other attacks due to SSRF.
