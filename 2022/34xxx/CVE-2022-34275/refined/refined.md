- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted PCB file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PCB file. This suggests the attack vector is local, requiring user interaction.
