- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read when parsing PCB files. Specifically, the application reads past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially leak information from the process memory.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted PCB file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PCB file. The attacker has local access. User interaction is required.
