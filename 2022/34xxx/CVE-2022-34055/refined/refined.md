The provided content relates to CVE-2022-34055.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a malicious backdoor injected into the `request` package, which was then included in version 0.0.1 of the `drxhello` Python package.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Malicious code injection in the `request` package.
- Supply chain vulnerability: an attacker injected malicious code into a dependency that was used in the `drxhello` package.
- Persistent availability of the malicious package on mirror sites, even after removal from the main PyPI repository.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on systems that install the affected version of `drxhello`.
- The specific nature of the malicious code is not detailed but could lead to various negative outcomes such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attack vector involves installing the malicious package version `drxhello==0.0.1` from a mirror site using `pip`, specifically by using the command `pip install drxhello==0.0.1 -i http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple --trusted-host pypi.doubanio.com`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code into a widely used dependency, like the `request` package in this case.
- The attacker needs the ability to host the poisoned package on mirror sites that are accessible to the victims.
- The attacker must also have knowledge of the project and its dependencies.
