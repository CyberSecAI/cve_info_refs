{
  "CVE-2022-34912": {
    "description": "The contributions-title, used on Special:Contributions, is used as page title without escaping. Hence, if a username contains HTML entities (not possible by default, [T308465](/T308465)), it won't be escaped.",
    "root_cause": "The username within the `contributions-title` message was not properly escaped before being used as the page title.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML or script code via a crafted username, which would then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the contributions page of the malicious user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A crafted username containing HTML entities"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a user account and set a username containing HTML entities. However, the provided information suggests this is not possible by default ([T308465](/T308465))."
