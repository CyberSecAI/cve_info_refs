- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker would need to have some form of access to the vulnerable system, likely requiring the user to open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Character Animator on the target machine. The user interaction is required, making it non-trivial to exploit.  The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system.
