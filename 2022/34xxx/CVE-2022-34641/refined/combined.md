| Our co-simulation framework found that the exception type of address translation PMP violation is incorrect.  In the following test case, we let a non-leaf (level 2) PTE out of the PMP range. Next, we will perform a store operation with a special virtual address, during translation processor will try to access the PTE that does not match any PMP. cva6 throws a load access fault, while spike throws a store access fault.  ``` [cva6]  Exception @    119000, PC: 000000008000036c, Cause: Load Access Fault, [cva6]                                 tval: 0000000080102008 [spike] core   0: 0x000000008000036c (0x00b52023) sw      a1, 0(a0) [spike] core   0: exception trap_store_access_fault, epc 0x000000008000036c [spike] core   0:           tval 0x0000000040201010 [spike] core   0: 0x0000000080000004 (0x34302f73) csrr    t5, mtval [error] WDATA SIM 0000000040201010, DUT 0000000080102008 [error] check board clear 30 error  ```  According to riscv-privileged specification:  If accessing pte violates a PMA or PMP check, raise an access-fault exception corresponding to the original access type.  Hence, cva6 should throw a store access fault.

| Thanks, cva6 throws a correct Store Access Fault exception, but the \*tval seems filled with the physical address instead of the virtual address:  ``` Exception @    119000, PC: 000000008000036c, Cause: Store Access Fault,                                 tval: 0000000080102008 core   0: 0x000000008000036c (0x00b52023) sw      a1, 0(a0) core   0: exception trap_store_access_fault, epc 0x000000008000036c core   0:           tval 0x0000000040201010 core   0: 0x0000000080000004 (0x34302f73) csrr    t5, mtval [error] WDATA SIM 0000000040201010, DUT 0000000080102008 [error] check board clear 30 error [CJ]           0 integer register Judge Failed     1204ns     1189 M 0000000080000004 0 34302f73 csrr           t5, mtval  ```  The related verse in specification is:  When page-based virtual memory is enabled, mtval is written with the faulting virtual address, even for physical-memory access-fault exceptions. |

### **[Moschn](/Moschn)** commented [Jun 9, 2022](#issuecomment-1151081614)

| I just read this section of the spec and it seems to be a bit ambiguous. Yes `mtval` should contain the faulting virtual address, but which address is this exactly? Is this the virtual address that is being translated? or the address of the PTW that failed? I guess all accesses during a page table walk are to physical memory and thus the faulting address should be the initial virtual address.  I force pushed the fix to [#908](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/pull/908). Can you check if it passes your tests now? |

### **[Phantom1003](/Phantom1003)** commented [Jun 8, 2022](#issue-1264818299)

| **Type of issue**: bug report **Impact**: unknown **Development Phase**: proposal **Other information**  Our co-simulation framework found that the exception type of address translation PMP violation is incorrect.  In the following test case, we let a non-leaf (level 2) PTE out of the PMP range. Next, we will perform a store operation with a special virtual address, during translation processor will try to access the PTE that does not match any PMP. boom throws a store page fault(0xf), while spike throws a store access fault(0x7).  ``` [boom]  3 0x0000000080000364 (0x0105051b) x10 0x0000000040201010 [boom]  3 0x0000000080000368 (0x02a00593) x11 0x000000000000002a [spike] core   0: 0x0000000080000364 (0x0105051b) addiw   a0, a0, 16 [spike] core   0: 0x0000000080000368 (0x02a00593) li      a1, 42 [boom]  3 0x0000000080000004 (0x34302f73) x30 0x0000000040201010 [spike] core   0: 0x000000008000036c (0x00b52023) sw      a1, 0(a0) [spike] core   0: exception trap_store_access_fault, epc 0x000000008000036c [spike] core   0:           tval 0x0000000040201010 [spike] core   0: 0x0000000080000004 (0x34302f73) csrr    t5, mtval [boom]  3 0x0000000080000008 (0x34202f73) x30 0x000000000000000f [spike] core   0: 0x0000000080000008 (0x34202f73) csrr    t5, mcause [error] WDATA SIM 0000000000000007, DUT 000000000000000f [error] check board clear 30 error [CJ]           0 integer register Judge Failed  ```  According to riscv-privileged specification:  If accessing pte violates a PMA or PMP check, raise an access-fault exception corresponding to the original access type.
