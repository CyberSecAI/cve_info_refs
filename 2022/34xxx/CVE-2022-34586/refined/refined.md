The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Advanced School Management System v1.0" by itsourcecode.com.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `grade` parameter of the `/school/view/student_grade_wise.php` script before using it in an SQL query.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. In this specific case, the attacker is able to extract the database name. This could lead to full database compromise such as data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is reachable through the HTTP GET request to `/school/view/student_grade_wise.php` via the `grade` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to access the vulnerable endpoint.
