- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application's search path is not properly controlled, potentially allowing an attacker to introduce malicious files that the application will execute with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation to the level of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious file in a location that is part of the application's uncontrolled search path, and have some local access to the target system.
