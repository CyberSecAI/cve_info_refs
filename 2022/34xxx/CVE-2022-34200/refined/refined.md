*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** The plugin's form validation method lacks proper authorization checks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can exploit the missing permission check by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable method.
    *   The CSRF vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a victim user into making a request to the vulnerable method via a crafted link or web page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker can be an authenticated user within the Jenkins instance.
