The provided content discusses a bug report regarding incorrect exception types during address translation when a PMA (Physical Memory Attribute) violation occurs. This aligns with the potential for a CVE related to incorrect exception handling.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect exception type raised by cva6 and boom when a PMA violation occurs during address translation. Specifically, when a non-leaf Page Table Entry (PTE) is modified to zero, causing the next level page dictionary to be located at address 0x0000, a memory location outside of valid address ranges, a PMA violation is triggered.
- cva6 throws a "store page fault" instead of the correct "store access fault", and boom throws a "store page fault" rather than the "store access fault".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect exception type handling for PMA violations.
- The systems are not adhering to the RISC-V privileged specification, which dictates that an access-fault exception corresponding to the original access type should be raised in case of a PMA/PMP check violation when accessing a PTE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The incorrect exception can lead to incorrect handling of memory access violations which can cause software instability.
- While the specific impact is not fully described, a incorrect exception will cause different behavior than expected. This could potentially cause issues for debugging, system stability and security.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating page table entries (PTEs) to cause an invalid address translation and consequent PMA violation.
- This could be triggered by an attacker having control over the page tables or being able to indirectly influence their contents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the page tables such that a PTE points to an invalid memory region. This implies the attacker has at least some level of privilege over the system.

**More Details than CVE description**

The content provides specific examples of test cases showing incorrect behaviour, as well as specific line numbers and register dumps to illustrate the issue. It also gives the exact violation by showing that when a level 2 PTE is set to 0, the subsequent level 2 page directory is at address 0x0, which violates PMA. This level of detail is not present in the CVE description. It also provides the information that the privileged specification of RISC-V indicates that the correct exception to raise is "access-fault".
