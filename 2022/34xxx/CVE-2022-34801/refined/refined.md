Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-34801:

**CVE-2022-34801** is related to the Build Notifications Plugin.

**Root Cause:**
The plugin stores multiple tokens unencrypted in its global configuration files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. Additionally, these tokens are transmitted in plain text as part of the global configuration form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **Insecure Storage:** The Pushover Application Token, Slack Bot Token, and Telegram Bot Token are stored unencrypted in the plugin's configuration files.
-  **Insecure Transmission:**  The tokens are transmitted in plain text during the global configuration form submission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exposure of these tokens could allow an attacker to potentially:
-   Send notifications using the compromised tokens.
-   Gain unauthorized access to connected services.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **File System Access:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the unencrypted tokens stored in the configuration files.
-  **Network Interception:** Attackers could potentially intercept the tokens during transmission via network sniffing while they are being submitted via the global configuration form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:**  The attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller file system to read the configuration files.
- **Network Access/Interception:**  An attacker with network access could potentially intercept the tokens during their transmission through the network

**Affected Plugin:**
- Build Notifications Plugin 1.5.0 and earlier
