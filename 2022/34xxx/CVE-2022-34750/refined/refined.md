Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-34750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation for the length of lemma in `Special:NewLexeme` and `Special:NewLexemeAlpha`, and the length of labels, descriptions, and aliases in `Special:NewProperty`. These special pages allowed users to create entries with terms exceeding the intended length limits, which could lead to performance issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the absence of proper length validation for user-provided text inputs (lemma, label, description, aliases) in specific special pages. The Javascript version of Special:NewLexemeAlpha did use the API, where the length was validated.
- **Bypass of Length Restrictions**: It was possible to bypass the length restrictions on lemma, labels, descriptions and aliases when creating new entries via Special:NewLexeme, Special:NewLexemeAlpha (non-JS version) and Special:NewProperty.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Creating lexemes with extremely long lemmas (e.g., 32768 characters) could slow down the browser due to the large amount of data.
- **Data Integrity Issues:**  Lexemes with overlong lemmas could not be edited unless they were shortened to the limit, potentially causing data management problems.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Overlong entries could be merged into other lexemes, effectively allowing a way to "edit" the overlong lemmas, and old revisions of lexemes with long lemmas could also be restored, including the long lemma.
- Though no existing lexemes with lemmas over 1000 characters existed in Wikidata at the time of the report, this was a vector for potentially causing DoS by creating large numbers of overlong entries, or potentially affecting the performance of other features by exploiting this issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Special Pages:** The attack vector was through the `Special:NewLexeme`, `Special:NewLexemeAlpha` (non-JS version) and `Special:NewProperty` special pages.
- **User Input:** The vulnerability was exploited by providing overly long text strings in the respective input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** An attacker would need to be an authenticated user with the ability to create new lexemes and properties on a MediaWiki instance with the affected extensions enabled (Wikibase and WikibaseLexeme).
- **Basic Knowledge:** No special technical skills were required, beyond being able to use the MediaWiki interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was initially found affecting Special:NewLexeme(Alpha), but later discovered that Special:NewProperty also had a similar issue.
- Patches were created and applied to validate the length of these inputs across the affected special pages and across multiple supported MediaWiki versions.
- A cleanup patch was also created to ensure consistency across these pages.
- The issue was assigned a "Low" risk rating.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed and a CVE ID was assigned.
