- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) vulnerability during the installation process of Schneider Electric's Easergy Builder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installer searches for files in an uncontrolled manner, allowing an attacker to place a malicious file in a location where the installer will find and execute it.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution during the installation of the Easergy Builder software and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally by placing a malicious file on the target machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a local privileged account and the ability to place files on the target machine. The attacker also requires a valid user to initiate the installation process.
