**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:

The attack vector is through the plugin, where user input is not properly sanitized or escaped, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into the affected input fields of the WordPress Team plugin.
