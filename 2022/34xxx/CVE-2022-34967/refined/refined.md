The content is related to a bug in MonetDB that causes a crash when using an ODBC driver with a specific SQL query.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server crashes during the parsing/optimizing of a `SELECT` query due to a missing check in `rel_order_by_column_exp` which results in an assertion failure and a crash. Specifically, the issue is related to the handling of window functions with `order by row_number() over()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A missing check for the `r` relation in `rel_order_by_column_exp` leads to a crash during query optimization. Additionally, the ODBC driver doesn't handle server crashes gracefully, leading to an assertion failure in `destroyODBCStmt`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A specially crafted SQL query can crash the MonetDB server and also the ODBC driver client, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending the specific SQL query "SELECT avg(42) over (order by row_number() over ()); SELECT 1;" to the MonetDB server via the ODBC driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send SQL queries to a MonetDB server through an ODBC client.
