- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in `cuobjdump`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cuobjdump` utility within the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation may lead to a limited denial of service and some loss of data integrity for the local user.
- **Attack vectors:** An unprivileged remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a local user to download a specially crafted corrupted file and then execute `cuobjdump` on it locally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to persuade a local user to download and execute a specially crafted file using the vulnerable `cuobjdump` utility. The attacker does not require local access or elevated privileges on the target system but does require the user to perform a specific action (run the tool).
