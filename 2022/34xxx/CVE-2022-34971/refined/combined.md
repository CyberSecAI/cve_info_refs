### **[TianT1209](/TianT1209)** commented [Jun 28, 2022](#issue-1287538769)

| This is the base information of the website. It is obviously the latest version of the feehi cms. And in the advertising management of feehi cms v2.1.1, you can upload PHP file by changing the image suffix to PHP, resulting in command execution.
