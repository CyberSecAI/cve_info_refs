Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file type validation during the upload process in the advertising management feature of Feehi CMS v2.1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate File Type Validation:** The system allows users to bypass file type restrictions by simply changing the file extension (e.g., from a .png to .php) before uploading.
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The lack of proper checks allows the upload of potentially malicious PHP files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** By uploading and executing a malicious PHP file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary remote command execution on the server hosting the application. This means they can potentially gain full control of the server, steal data, or cause disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered through the advertising management file upload functionality of the Feehi CMS.
- **File Extension Spoofing:** The attacker manipulates the file extension of a malicious file before upload to bypass the weak validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to the advertising management feature within the Feehi CMS.
- No specific privileges are mentioned beyond having access to the admin panel, if it is required to upload an advertisement.

**Additional Information:**

The issue report provides screenshots of the vulnerable function and the file upload vulnerability exploitation via changing the file extension.
