SSA-243317 File Parsing Vulnerability in Simcenter Femap and
Parasolid

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2022-07-12

V1.2

SUMMARY

Simcenter Femap and Parasolid are affected by an out of bounds read vulnerability that could be triggered
when the application reads ﬁles in NEU format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected
applications, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context
of the current process.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Parasolid is a 3D geometric modeling tool that supports various techniques, including solid modeling,
direct editing, and free-form surface/sheet modeling.

Simcenter Femap is an advanced simulation application for creating, editing, and inspecting ﬁnite element
models of complex products or systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-34465

The affected application contains an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while
parsing specially crafted NEU ﬁles. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the
current process. (ZDI-CAN-15420)
