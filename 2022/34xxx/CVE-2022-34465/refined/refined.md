- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to the application reading past the end of an allocated structure when parsing specially crafted NEU files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a user opening a malicious NEU file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious NEU file.
