**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of Anti-Virus of Uploaded Files:** The application doesn't scan uploaded files for malicious content.
2.  **Unrestricted File Upload:** There are no restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded.
3.  **XSS via File Upload:** Malicious files, such as HTML files containing JavaScript, can be uploaded and executed in the context of the application.
4.  **File Upload Locations:** Vulnerable upload locations include user profile images and recipe images.
5.  **File Accessibility:** Uploaded files are accessible by both authenticated and unauthenticated users, increasing the impact of exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If an uploaded file is interpreted as code by the recipient's browser, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can upload malicious HTML files to create phishing pages.
*  **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can upload malware, spreading it to users accessing the malicious files.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into web pages via uploaded files, allowing attackers to execute scripts in users' browsers.
*   **Malicious File Sharing:** Attackers can upload and share various types of malicious files.

*  **Uploading malicious Recipe Images**: An attacker can upload malicious images which can be accessed by any user.
* **Direct Access:** Direct access to the uploaded files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to upload files.
