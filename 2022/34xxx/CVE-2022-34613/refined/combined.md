# CVE-2022-34613, CVE-2022-34618, CVE-2022-34619 ‚Äì Multiple XSS (And more) in Mealie

[CVE](https://gainsec.com/category/cve/), [Web Application Pen Testing](https://gainsec.com/category/web-application-pen-testing/)
August 2, 2022August 2, 2022

A follow-up to the last post! And don‚Äôt worry there‚Äôs still more vulnerabilities coming! Per the last post these were a joint effort between my co-worker, Bruno Hern√°ndez ([GitHub](https://github.com/0xBruno) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-x-hernandez)), and I at [nVisium](https://nvisium.com/) (although after hours of course) to find some more CVEs (and his first CVE) which led me to suggest an open source web application called Mealie which can be found [HERE](https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/).

[CVE-2022-34619](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34619) is a Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the mealie version pulled from docker is v0.5.5 found [HERE](https://hub.docker.com/r/hkotel/mealie). Lesson learned, don‚Äôt trust docker to have the most current version of an application üôÇ

This one is a stored XSS in Mealie v0.5.5 which allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the Shopping Lists item names text field.

AKA Any authenticated user can create a shopping list then modify it with malicious JavaScript which is executed by all unauthenticated and authenticated users when accessing the site.

[CVE-2022-34618](https://cve.report/CVE-2022-34618) is another Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Fortunately! This does affect the most current mealie version pre reaching out to the dev v1.0.0beta3 found [HERE](https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie/releases/tag/v1.0.0beta-3).

This is a stored XSS in Mealie v1.0.0beta3 which allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the recipe description text field.

Specifically, any authenticated user can create a recipe and include malicious JavaScript in its description that any unauthenticated target can access which is executed.

Lastly! [CVE-2022-34613](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34613) encompasses MULTIPLE vulnerabilities.

I won‚Äôt list them ALL here but malicious files such as an [EICAR](https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/) file can be uploaded (1. Lack of Anti-Virus of Uploaded Files), this means that the 2. File Upload is Unrestricted, XSS Files can be uploaded and then shared/executed unauthenticated. Other malicious files can be shared and so forth. If you‚Äôre interested in the complete details LMK! Otherwise, I‚Äôve listed some of the ‚Äúimpacts‚Äù of the vulnerability below

Upload a html file containing malicious JavaScript as your profile image and then send a target a link to your profile image or wait for a user to navigate to your profile page.

Arbitrary code execution is possible if an uploaded file is interpreted and executed as code by the recipient. In this case, the more likely impact is phishing or spreading malware.

The software allows the attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product‚Äôs environment. HTML files containing malicious JavaScript can be uploaded as Recipe Images. These are accessible by unauthenticated targets.

Can write malicious files anywhere on the host.

For example, here is a user‚Äôs image set to a malicious XSS payload!
