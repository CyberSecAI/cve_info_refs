Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-34901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an uncontrolled search path element vulnerability within the Parallels Service. Specifically, the service executes files from an unsecured location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The Parallels service searches for and executes files from a location that is not properly secured, allowing an attacker to potentially place malicious executables in that path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to root/SYSTEM level.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With elevated privileges, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target machine, this limits the attack vector to local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system as a prerequisite.
- **File System Manipulation:** Ability to place a malicious executable in the unsecured location used by the Parallels Service.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability exists in the way Parallels Access Agent's service handles file execution, by using an unsecured path an attacker with low privilege access can replace a legitimate executable with their own, leading to privilege escalation and the potential for arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
