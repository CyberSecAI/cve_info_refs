Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `svg2img.php` file. The application directly uses user-supplied input (specifically the `w` parameter) in the output without encoding or validating it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application is vulnerable to both reflected XSS and potentially stored XSS if the user-provided data is saved and later displayed.
*   **HTML Injection:** The vulnerability allows injection of arbitrary HTML code, leading to potential content manipulation or other malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Execution of Arbitrary JavaScript:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  Attackers can potentially steal cookies or session tokens, leading to account compromise.
*   **Content Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the content of the web page displayed to users.
*   **Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal private data, such as user files.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can install Trojan horse programs or other malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can inject malicious code through the `w` parameter in the URL.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  The malicious code is reflected back to the user from the server within the response.
*   **Stored XSS:** If the application saves the vulnerable input, the attack can be persistent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious JavaScript or HTML code embedded in the `w` parameter.
*   **Ability to Induce Users to Visit Malicious Links:**  Attackers need a way to get victims to click on the malicious URLs, typically through social engineering (phishing emails, malicious links on websites, etc.). For stored XSS, the attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious payload into the application data store.

**Additional details:**

*   The github content provides a Proof of Concept (POC) for the vulnerability:
    `http://.../i3geo/pacotes/svg2img.php?w=%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22HACKED%22)%3C/script%3E%3C!--`
    This URL demonstrates how to inject JavaScript code through the `w` parameter.
*   The OWASP content describes various types of XSS attacks, including reflected and stored XSS, along with techniques to exploit and prevent them.
*   The softwarepublico.gov.br content does not directly provide vulnerability information but contains general information about the i3Geo software and its resources, where the vulnerability exists.

This is a classic example of an XSS vulnerability caused by insufficient input validation.
