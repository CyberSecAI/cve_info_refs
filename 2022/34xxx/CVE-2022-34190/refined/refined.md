Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-34190:

**CVE-2022-34190** is associated with **SECURITY-2714**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Maven Metadata Plugin for Jenkins CI server does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that is stored within the Jenkins UI. When a user views the affected page, the injected script can execute, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker with Item/Configure permission can configure a job to use a malicious parameter name or description. When parameters are listed on another page like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages, the XSS can be triggered.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs Item/Configure permission to exploit this vulnerability and the exploitation requires the use of the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages.

The advisory also mentions that Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of this kind of vulnerability on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since version 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2. Also, some plugins have been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default.

The affected plugin is Maven Metadata Plugin for Jenkins CI server and the vulnerable versions are 2.1 and earlier. The document also notes that there is no fix available for this plugin as of the advisory publication date.
