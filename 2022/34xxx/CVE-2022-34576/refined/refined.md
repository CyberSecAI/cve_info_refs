Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authorization for the `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` file. This allows unauthenticated access to the device's configuration settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of access control on the `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` script.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The script returns the device's current configuration, which includes the administrator password.
- **Weak Encryption/Obfuscation:** While the data is not in plain text, the method of obfuscation is readily decryptable, as the decryption information is publicly available.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Device Control:** By obtaining the administrator password, an attacker can gain full control over the vulnerable device. This includes changing configurations, potentially redirecting traffic, and performing other malicious actions.
- **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data such as admin passwords poses a significant security risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` endpoint.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device (e.g., within the same network or via a publicly exposed device).
- **Basic Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to send a HTTP request and decrypt the data which the researcher claims that all decryption information is readily available.

**Additional Notes**
- The content specifies that the vulnerability is present in WAVLINK WN579G3 with firmware package version M35G3R.V5030.180927. However, the title of the document refers to WAVLINK WN535 G3. This discrepancy should be noted.
- The provided content appears to be a detailed description of the vulnerability, potentially more detailed than the standard CVE description.
