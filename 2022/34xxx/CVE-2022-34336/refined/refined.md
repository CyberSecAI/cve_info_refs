- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Admin Console of IBM WebSphere Application Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the Admin Console, suggesting an attacker would need to access the console to exploit it. The specific method of injecting malicious scripts isn't provided in this document, but is likely through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would likely require network access to the WebSphere Admin Console. They may need to be an authenticated user or be able to inject the malicious script through a different mechanism, if the console has some external facing feature.
