- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to improper handling of string splitting within the `getElement` function when processing parameters in the `DelDNSHnList` interface. The size of the `V6` array is only 16, but the `getElement` function can write up to 64 bytes, causing an overflow when the input string exceeds the bounds of the `V6` array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability, an attacker can gain a stable root shell without authorization, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint, specifically targeting the `DelDNSHnList` command and overflowing the `param` field with a long string of 'a' characters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device's web interface. This likely requires network access to the device, which could be on the same local network or exposed to the internet, depending on the device's configuration.
