The provided content relates to CVE-2022-34600.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `param` parameter from an HTTP POST request to a stack buffer (`V8` array) without checking the size of the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to unchecked copying of data using `strcpy`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited to gain a root shell without authorization. The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint, specifically targeting the `EditSTList` command with an overly long `param` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This implies that the attacker is on the same network or has access to the device through a network.
