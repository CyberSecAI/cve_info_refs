The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34297. It describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the Yii2 Gii module.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Some fields in Gii module generators (e.g., Message Category, Author Name) are cached without sanitization when the "Preview" button is pressed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious JavaScript can be injected into specific pages by placing it in vulnerable fields and caching it by pressing the "Preview" button.
- The injected JavaScript is loaded from the server and executed in the client's browser on subsequent visits to those pages.
- This can lead to denial of service and privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into vulnerable fields like Message Category (when I18N is enabled) in Model Generator, CRUD Generator, or Form Generator, and Author Name in Extension Generator.
- The attacker then presses the "Preview" button, which caches the unsanitized input.
- When a user revisits the affected pages, the cached malicious JavaScript is loaded and executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the affected Gii module pages.
- The attacker needs to be able to input data into the vulnerable fields within the generators and click the preview button to cache the input.
