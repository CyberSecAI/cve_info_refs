- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing specially crafted PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a malicious PCB file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PCB file. The attacker needs local access, no privileges, and user interaction is required.
