| Hi :)  When I was decompiling the Lua script on openwrt, I found a `segmentation fault` error. I try to debug luadec to find the location of bug. Size of some array variables in function structure is 255. However, these variables were accessed out of bounds in decompiling.  ``` #define MAXARG_A        ((1<<SIZE_A)-1)    // 255  /* Function structure in /home/lys/Tools/luadec/luadec/decompile.h*/ /* These act as the VM registers */ char* R[MAXARG_A]; /* These store the priority for the operation that stored the value in each register */ int Rprio[MAXARG_A]; /* Boolean values indicating if register holds a table */ int Rtabl[MAXARG_A]; /* Registers standing for local variables. */ int Rvar[MAXARG_A]; /* Pending code to be flushed */ int Rpend[MAXARG_A]; /* Registers for internal use */ int Rinternal[MAXARG_A]; /* Registers used in call returns */ int Rcall[MAXARG_A]; ```  Below is the log.  ``` $ /home/lys/Tools/luadec/luadec/luadec sys.lua cannot find blockend > 251 , pc = 250,
