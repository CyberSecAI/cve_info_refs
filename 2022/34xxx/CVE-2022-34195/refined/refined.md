{
  "CVE-2022-34195": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Repository Connector plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter type it provides.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Stored XSS"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into the parameter's name or description, which will be executed when a user views pages listing these parameters (e.g., 'Build With Parameters' or 'Parameters' pages). This could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of other users viewing these pages.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a page displaying a job parameter where an attacker has injected malicious code. It requires that parameters are listed on another page and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs Item/Configure permission to modify the job configuration and inject the malicious code into the parameter definition. The attacker also needs a victim to view the page where the parameter is displayed to trigger the XSS vulnerability."
