{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ObjectYPT` class in `objects/Object.php` constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-controlled input without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can allow attackers to dump the database, which contains password hashes. These password hashes can then be used to log in as administrator. With administrator access, arbitrary code execution is possible via plugin upload, leading to full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests with malicious payloads in parameters such as `description` field when creating/editing a Live schedule",
         "HTTP requests with malicious payloads in parameters such as video `duration` or `videoDownloadedLink` when adding new video",
         "HTTP requests with malicious payloads in parameters such as `url` when cloning a site"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. For some vulnerabilities, a valid user session with specific permissions (e.g., the ability to stream videos, or upload videos) may be required. For others such as the clone site, no authentication is required."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists in WWBN AVideo versions 11.6 and dev master commit 3f7c0364. The advisory notes that while the SQL injection cannot lead to direct arbitrary code execution on default configurations, it can be chained to achieve it by first dumping password hashes, logging in as admin, and then uploading a malicious plugin. The specific vulnerability in CVE-2022-34652 is related to the Live Schedules description parameter."
