* Fixed an issue that caused the RRD rebuild mechanism to fail
* Fixed an issue that caused BAM Business activities with âIgnore the indicator in the calculationâ as planned downtime calculation method to stop ignoring downtimed KPIs when they had overlapping downtimes

### 21.10.2[â](#21102-1 "Direct link to heading")

Release date: `June 15, 2022`

#### Centreon Broker[â](#centreon-broker-3 "Direct link to heading")

##### Improvements[â](#improvements-2 "Direct link to heading")

* Improved the way TCP connections are stored by keeping them in an ordered structure. This should avoid rare connection issues experienced by some users

##### Bug fixes[â](#bug-fixes-15 "Direct link to heading")

* Fixed an issue that caused broker to crash when a BAM output was configured and the BAM tables did not exist
* Added a `bbdo_version` function to the LUA libraries for Stream Connectors developers
* Scheduled downtimes used to be inserted one at a time, which caused performance issues on platforms with a lot of recurrent scheduled downtimes. They are now injected in bulk inserts to reduce demands on the database and avoid performance issues.
* Broker crashed when a logger was disabled/off
* Fixed an issue that could prevent broker from connecting again after the database was stopped to make a LVM snapshot
* Broker crashed when its configuration included a filter that referred to a module that wasn't loaded

* Fixed an issue that caused loss of recovery notifications when a downtime end notification was sent before recovery
* Reviewed the way time period exceptions are handled to fix some issues with the way notifications are managed

##### Bug fixes[â](#bug-fixes-17 "Direct link to heading")

* Fixed an issue that could cause the SSH connector to crash
* Fixed a memory leak issue in the Perl connector

> As of version 21.10.0, the components of Centreon Collect (Centreon Broker, Centreon Clib, Centreon Engine and Centreon Connectors)
> are released simultaneously. They are now grouped under this section.

### 21.10.1[â](#21101-1 "Direct link to heading")

Release date: `February 23, 2022`

#### Centreon Broker[â](#centreon-broker-4 "Direct link to heading")

##### Improvements[â](#improvements-4 "Direct link to heading")

* Improved the multiplexing of events, which was a performance bottleneck. The processing speed of queued events should be significantly increased.
* Some TLS trace logs were logged as errors, flooding the log file.
* The SQL connections stats have been added to the broker stats available via gRPC.
* Added the SQL Manager statistics in gRPC and stabilized the stats provider.
* Added to LUA Stream Connectors' perfdata label parser the compatibility with centreon-plugins new metrics naming convention.

##### Bug fixes[â](#bug-fixes-18 "Direct link to heading")

* Fixed a regression due to the central broker's cache generation optimization, which was too thorough and prevented BAM from computing KPIs based on boolean rules
* The central broker's cache generation loaded too much data and took too much time when BAM was activated.
* Fixed an issue that could cause segmentation faults in centreon-engine when scheduling external commands
* Fixed a design issue to avoid trying to access variables of broker's new logger when the logger was stopped. This issue could cause segmentation faults.
* When a single metric is deleted, the corresponding RRD file is now actually removed.
* If the SQL stream took too long to initialize its connection, then the Perfdata stream timed out and the whole connection failed. To fix this, the timeout has been increased.
* In some circumstances, the `mysql_ping` function, which is used to test if the session is still active, could freeze. To fix this, the calls to `mysql_ping` have been spaced out, a timeout has been added, and the commit management has been consolidated.
* Fixed an issue causing BAM Business Activities (best status) to remain in an OK state when the OK KPIs were removed
* Refactored the BAM Business activities downtimes inheritance mechanism so that they are properly inherited and not duplicated anymore.

> After having updated centreon-broker to this version, you may still have unwanted remaining downtimes on your Business Activities. It can happen if a downtime that was inherited from a KPI has been duplicated and if the original downtime ended before the bugfix was installed. In that case, you will have to apply the following procedure.

```
systemctl stop centengine
sed -i -zE 's/(servicecomment|servicedowntime) \{\nhost_name=_Module_BAM_1\n[^}]*\}\n//g' /var/log/centreon-engine/retention.dat
systemctl start centengine

```

All the downtimes applied on Business Activities have now been removed.

You must then restart the `centengine` service on all the other pollers to restore the legitimate inherited downtimes.

### 21.10.0[â](#21100-1 "Direct link to heading")

#### Centreon Engine[â](#centreon-engine-2 "Direct link to heading")

* Flapping now starts only on non-OK states. Based on PR [#523](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine/pull/523)
* Flapping now starts only for services of UP hosts or for hosts with UP parent. Based on PR [#524](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine/pull/524). Fixes Issue [#192](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine/issues/192)
* Provide feedback on gRPC client execution success/failure

#### Centreon Broker[â](#centreon-broker-5 "Direct link to heading")

* Queues (in memory and retention files) are now cleared for reversed broker flows without `peer retention` when the connection is reset. This is a change of behavior back to what it should have always been. It will prevent endless retention files for Centreon-Studio (Centreon-Map).
* [BETA] Centreon-broker is now able to use OpenSSL instead of GNUTLS and allows forcing TLS/SSL version and cipher suite
* Broker now only loads the modules that are necessary for its inputs and outputs
* Old broker log format has been removed

#### Bugfixes[â](#bugfixes-1 "Direct link to heading")

* Make Gorgoneâs private key readable by centreon-gorgone only
