Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Malicious code was injected into the `requests` package within versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 of the `PyCrowdTangle` project. The malicious `requests` package acts as a backdoor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Supply chain attack: The legitimate `requests` package was replaced with a malicious version on certain mirror sites.
- Code injection: The malicious `requests` package contained code that would execute on systems where `PyCrowdTangle` versions 0.0.1 or 0.0.2 were installed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code execution: The malicious code could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine
- Full system compromise: An attacker could potentially gain full control of the affected system
- Data exfiltration: The backdoor could potentially steal sensitive data

**Attack Vectors:**
- Installation via PyPI mirror: Attackers leveraged PyPI mirror sites that had not completely removed the malicious package
- Package version: Targeted versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 of `PyCrowdTangle`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to upload malicious package to PyPI mirror: The attacker needed to be able to replace the legitimate `requests` package on mirror sites like the one mentioned (pypi.doubanio.com).
- Lure users to install the malicious PyCrowdTangle package: Users would need to install the compromised versions of the `PyCrowdTangle` package from the compromised mirror.

**Additional notes:**
- The issue report on GitHub provides more detail than a standard CVE description by describing the exact mechanism of the attack (malicious request package on mirror sites).
- The suggested fix is to delete the compromised versions from PyPI.
