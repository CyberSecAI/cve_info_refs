The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2022-34791.

**CVE-2022-34791**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Validating Email Parameter Plugin does not escape the name and description of its parameter type. Additionally, it disables the security hardening added in Jenkins 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin disables a fix for a previous vulnerability, making it vulnerable again.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission to set a malicious name or description for an email parameter. The XSS will be triggered when a user views the "Build with Parameters" or "Parameters" page of the job.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs Item/Configure permission.
