- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The File Server Cache service in Teamcenter is vulnerable to a denial of service by entering infinite loops and consuming excessive CPU cycles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is related to an infinite loop (CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition) within the File Server Cache service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by triggering the infinite loop, leading to the service becoming unresponsive due to high CPU utilization.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), suggesting a remote attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) and no user interaction (UI:N).
