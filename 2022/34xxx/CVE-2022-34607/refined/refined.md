```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `strncpy` function is used to copy data from the HTTP request parameter `HOST` to a stack buffer `V10` without any size check, which results in a stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow due to unbounded copy using `strncpy`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and gaining a root shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/doping.asp` endpoint with an oversized `HOST` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device."
