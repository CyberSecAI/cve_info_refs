        "root_cause": "The `create` API function in `HyperVController` creates a default `DockerDesktop.vhdx` file based on the path in the DataFolder field. This path is user-controlled and can be set to any location on the file system. By combining this behavior with symlink abuse, an arbitrary file overwrite can be achieved.",

          "The attacker can exploit the vulnerable API function by controlling the `DataFolder` field in the request."
