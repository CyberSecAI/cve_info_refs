**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The REST List Parameter Plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper escaping of parameter names and descriptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into the Jenkins UI via the parameter's name and description. This could allow attackers to perform actions with the victim's privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by configuring a job that utilizes the vulnerable parameter type and then viewing a page that renders the job's parameters, like the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission to configure a job that uses the vulnerable parameter type. Additionally, the attacker would require the user to view a page which renders the parameter's name or description.
