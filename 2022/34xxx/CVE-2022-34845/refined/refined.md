- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `sysupgrade` binary, used for firmware updates on Robustel R1510 routers, does not perform any signature verification of the firmware image before applying the update. This allows an attacker to upload and install a malicious firmware image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient verification of data authenticity (CWE-345) is the primary weakness. The lack of signature verification on the firmware image allows for arbitrary firmware updates. The API endpoints `/action/import_firmware` and `/ajax/system_upgrade_start/` do not enforce proper security controls.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite the device's firmware with a malicious version, potentially enabling complete control over the device, data exfiltration, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: A network attacker can send a sequence of requests to the `/action/import_firmware` and `/ajax/system_upgrade_start/` APIs. This involves first uploading a malicious firmware image using `/action/import_firmware` and then triggering the firmware update using `/ajax/system_upgrade_start/`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and have administrative privileges (or be able to impersonate an admin). The CVSS vector indicates high privileges (PR:H) are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
