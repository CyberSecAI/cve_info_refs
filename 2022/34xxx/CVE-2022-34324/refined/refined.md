- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Sage XRT Business Exchange application does not sanitize user input on specific parameters before using them in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data into the queries.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple authenticated blind SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in the application due to the lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the vulnerabilities are located in the following pages:
    - Add Devises / Ajout de devises
    - Payment Order / Ordre de paiement
    - Transfer history / Historique des transferts

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
    - Reading files on the underlying server.
    - Extracting database records.
    - Executing commands on the host.
    - Retrieving the NetNTLMv2 hash for the user account running the MSSQL service.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending crafted POST requests to vulnerable endpoints with malicious SQL code embedded within the vulnerable parameters.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Sage XRT Business Exchange application to exploit these vulnerabilities.
