- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read exists in the Intel Media SDK software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privilege is possible.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user and must induce the vulnerable code to perform an out-of-bounds read. User interaction is required.
