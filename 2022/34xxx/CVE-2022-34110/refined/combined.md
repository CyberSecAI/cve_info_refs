# CVE-2022-34108, CVE-2022-34109, CVE-2022-34110 DoS + Arbitrary file Download/Copy in MSI Feature Navigator

* Description: An issue in the Feature Navigator of Micro-Star International MSI Feature Nagivator v1.0.1808.0901 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a specially crafted image or video file.

So here are the last three pending vulnerabilities I found! However please note that [CVE-2022-34109](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34109) and [CVE-2022-34110](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34110) were found thanks to team work with my co-worker at [nVisium](https://nvisium.com/) Bruno Hernández ([Github](https://github.com/0xBruno) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-x-hernandez/)).

I’ve been sitting on the Denial of Service (DoS) [[CVE-2022-34108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34108)] for years though. I’ve reached out to MSI about these issues but never heard back.

If you’ve ever gone to a store like Best Buy and looked at the laptops sold, you’ll notice that most of them have this preview software running that shows the specifications, maybe a video or two or whatever.

Well following my advice from this [POST](https://gainsec.com/2022/08/06/how-i-found-15-cves-in-3-nights-and-how-you-can-too/) years ago I started to look at what was installed by default on my new gaming laptop. That’s where I stumbled into the Feature Navigator software.

![](https://i0.wp.com/gainsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-1024x652.png?resize=1024%2C652&ssl=1)

Here’s what it looks like when you open it

As I started to click around I didn’t see much to chew on however in the top right there is a settings icon.

Clicking that leads to a Settings menu containing two tabs: System and Media.

You can set Password Protection to close the application (which I’m looking into messing more with), set the application to automatically open, check for software updates (which I believe I never have) and a few other options.

The second tab is Media however. This is where you can set video volume AND most importantly, add Promotion Pictures and Videos.

![](https://i0.wp.com/gainsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4-1024x425.png?resize=1024%2C425&ssl=1)

This where all three CVEs were found.

Lets start with the two basic ones.

If you click the Browse button under Video it opens file explorer window to select a filename with no restrictions. That means any type of Video (or non video file can be selected). We found that if you put a URL it will download any file to the AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\NetCache\\* directory. This is a great way to transfer files to the host if its compromised and locked down.

![](https://i0.wp.com/gainsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png?resize=955%2C536&ssl=1)

Here I downloaded Google’s favicon.ico

Alternatively, under promotion if you hit the + button, a file explorer window is open which is limited to certain filetypes: jpg, png and bmp. Pretty standard stuff. However you can just paste any URL/direct path on the computer to copy a file. Note that the direct path will cause a stack trace and if you try to click the settings button it will crash and not reopen (DoS!) until you delete the file.

![](https://i0.wp.com/gainsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-5-1024x586.png?resize=1024%2C586&ssl=1)

Selecting powershell.exe

Now hit the open button

A stack trace will appear saying “no imaging component suitable to complete this operation was found”

![](https://i0.wp.com/gainsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6-1024x311.png?resize=1024%2C311&ssl=1)

Now if you navigate to where this application lives and is supposed to store its images/videos (C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI\MSI Feature Navigator\PromoPhoto\) you’ll see a new exe there!

![](https://i0.wp.com/gainsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-7.png?resize=717%2C154&ssl=1)

Sweet! These are [CVE-2022-34109](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34109) and [CVE-2022-34110](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34110)

Although the second example does include a form of the DoS I mentioned. However I found an easier way.

The other way is just to try to add a file with the png/jpg/bmp extension and an RTLO name like [THIS](https://github.com/GainSec/TreeHouse-Wordlists/blob/master/File%20Upload%20Payloads/Right%20To%20Left%20Override%20-%20Encoding%20-%20RTLO/html--%20%D7%91%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%AA%21%E2%80%8F.png) one from [Treehouse Wordlists](https://github.com/GainSec/TreeHouse-Wordlists) which will result in the application crashing and refusing to reopen until the file is deleted from the (C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI\MSI Feature Navigator\PromoPhoto\) directory. Resulting again in a Dos! Which was assigned [CVE-2022-34108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34108)
