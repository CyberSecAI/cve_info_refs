- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that can lead to the disclosure of trusted credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through user-controlled input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to input data into the system that is not properly sanitized, which could potentially be achieved through various interaction points with the application.
