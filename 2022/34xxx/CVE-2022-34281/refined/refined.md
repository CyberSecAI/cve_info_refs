- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read when parsing PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could achieve remote code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted PCB file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PCB file.
