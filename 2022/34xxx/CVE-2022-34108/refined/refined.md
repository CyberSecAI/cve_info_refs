  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The MSI Feature Navigator application does not properly validate user-provided file paths when adding promotion pictures, which leads to a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Improper handling of file paths"
    ],
    "impact": "The application crashes and refuses to reopen until the malicious file is deleted from the application's 'PromoPhoto' directory, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Adding a direct file path, rather than a valid image file, to the promotion pictures in the application settings",
       "Adding a file with the png/jpg/bmp extension and an RTLO (Right-to-Left Override) name"
    ],
