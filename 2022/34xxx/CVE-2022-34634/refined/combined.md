| Our co-simulation framework found the decoder has an incorrect behavior when execute a `dret` with non-zero rd field.  According to the Debug Specification Version 1.0.0:  To resume execution, the debug module sets a flag which causes the hart to execute a `dret`. `dret` is an instruction that only has meaning while in Debug Mode and not executing from the Program Buffer. Its recommended encoding is 0x7b200073.  When modified instr[11:7] to 5'b00001. cva6 treats this invalid `dret` as normal `dret` as well. No exception occurred. The implementation is missing a check for this field.  In the following test case, there is an invalid `dret` at 0x8000019c, whose rd field is 1, cva6 execute it as normal instruction, while spike throws an excaption.  ``` [spike] core   0: 0x000000008000019c (0x7b200273) unknown [spike] core   0: exception trap_illegal_instruction, epc 0x000000008000019c [spike] core   0:           tval 0x000000007b200273 [spike] core   0: 0x0000000080000004 (0x00000f17) auipc   t5, 0x0 [error] PC SIM 0000000080000004, DUT 000000008000019c [error] INSN SIM 00000f17, DUT 7b200273 [CJ] Commit Failed [cva6]     786ns      771 D 000000008000019c 0 7b200273 INVALID   // CVA6 continues to execute  [cva6]    1068ns     1053 S 000000008000017c 0 0ff0000f fence         // subsequent instructions  ```  We believe is the debug mode checking reset the correct signal:   [cva6/core/decoder.sv](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/909d85a56cc5ace65765a63d7ed56b7ac2026f99/core/decoder.sv#L134-L135)  Lines 134 to 135 in [909d85a](/openhwgroup/cva6/commit/909d85a56cc5ace65765a63d7ed56b7ac2026f99)   |  | // check that we are in debug mode when executing this instruction | | --- | --- | |  | illegal\_instr = (!debug\_mode\_i) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; |      [cva6-3.zip](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/8833048/cva6-3.zip)  @LuminaDCIX helps reproduce the problem |
