Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-34002

**Vulnerability:** Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Root Cause:** The `document` parameter within the `/application/documents/display.aspx` page of Personnel Data Systems (PDS) Vista 7 is vulnerable to LFI due to insufficient input validation. This allows an attacker to specify a file path, leading to access of files within the web application directory.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **CWE-22:** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). The application fails to properly validate and restrict the file paths provided in the `document` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can read sensitive files, such as configuration files (e.g., `web.config`) and potentially source code of the web application.
*   The disclosure of configuration files may reveal sensitive information such as database connection strings, encryption keys or other critical configuration parameters.
*   Source code access can aid in discovering other vulnerabilities or reveal business logic.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is reachable over the network (HTTP).
*   **Input:** The vulnerable parameter is the `document` parameter in the `/application/documents/display.aspx` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a low-privileged authenticated account to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** Attacker requires network access to the web application.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable page is `/application/documents/display.aspx`.
*   The `document` parameter is used to specify the file to be displayed.
*   By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can read any file within the web application’s root or subdirectories.
*   The response containing the file contents is often found within the `padDiv` section of the HTML source.
*   The vulnerability is located in versions of PDS Vista 7 prior to '7.1.7.2 – External Applicants Security Hotfix – XA Clients Only'

**Proof of Concept:**

1.  Log in to the PDS Vista 7 application with a valid low-privileged user account.
2.  Navigate to `/application/documents/display.aspx?document=/web.config`.
3.  Locate the 'padDiv' tag in the HTML source to extract the content of the `/web.config` file.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the patch '7.1.7.2 – External Applicants Security Hotfix – XA Clients Only'.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is manually exploitable.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Nick Berrie of Assura, Inc.
