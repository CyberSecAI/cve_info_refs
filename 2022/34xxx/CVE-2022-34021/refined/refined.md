- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application stores user-supplied input in form fields without proper sanitization, and renders it as JavaScript code, leading to XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By entering malicious JavaScript code into form fields, the attacker can inject code that is executed in the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to input data into a form field of the application.
