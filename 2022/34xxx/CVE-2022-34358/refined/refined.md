Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-34358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the old web application of the Digital Certificate Manager for IBM i. This means that the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users of the Digital Certificate Manager application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
*   Execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.
*   Potentially steal sensitive information (e.g., session cookies).
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
*   Deface the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the old web application of the Digital Certificate Manager. It is suggested that it is through user-supplied input to the application which is then not correctly sanitized on output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable web application. This could involve crafting a URL, form input, or other data that will be displayed on the affected application pages. The attacker would also need to trick the targeted user to access the malicious content.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability exists in the "heritage" version of the Digital Certificate Manager.
* IBM has provided PTFs (Program Temporary Fixes) to address the XSS issue.
* IBM has also provided PTFs to disable the heritage version of Digital Certificate Manager and recommends using the new user interface as a mitigation.
* Superseded PTFs were also released which included additional URLs for XSS exploitation
