**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability Category:** Out-of-bounds Write ([CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html))
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 7.8
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write condition (CWE-787). This means the software is writing to a memory location that it is not authorized to use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could execute malicious code on the user's machine with the same privileges as the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Local (AV:L)
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low (AC:L)
*   **Privileges Required:** None (PR:N)
*  **User Interaction:** Required (UI:R)
* **Scope:** Unchanged (S:U)
* **Confidentiality Impact:** High (C:H)
* **Integrity Impact:** High (I:H)
* **Availability Impact:** High (A:H)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to get the user to open a specially crafted file. The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected product is Adobe InCopy versions 17.2 and earlier, and 16.4.1 and earlier on both Windows and macOS platforms.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Adobe InCopy version 17.3 and 16.4.2.
*  The CVSS vector indicates that this vulnerability is exploitable locally, requires user interaction, and can result in high impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.
