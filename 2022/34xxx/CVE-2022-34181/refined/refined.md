  "CVE-2022-34181": {
    "root_cause": "The xUnit Plugin implements an agent-to-controller message that creates a user-specified directory if it doesnâ€™t exist, and parsing files inside it as test results.",

      "Agent-to-controller message processing allows for arbitrary directory creation on the controller",
      "Agent-to-controller message allows for parsing test results from attacker-specified directories"
