  "description": "A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of Tiffsplit. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file parsed by the \"tiffsplit\" or \"tiffcrop\" utilities.",
  "affected_software": [
    {
      "name": "Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere",

  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the _TIFFVGetField function within the LibTIFF library, specifically when processing a crafted TIFF file using tiffsplit or tiffcrop utilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
       "Integer overflow",
       "Out of bounds read/write",
       "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a crash, and in some cases, potentially allow for further exploitation such as arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted TIFF image to vulnerable utilities (tiffsplit, tiffcrop).",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted TIFF file to the vulnerable utility."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "more_info": "The vulnerability is present in LibTIFF version v4.4.0. Although the issue was already patched in [!363 (merged)](/libtiff/libtiff/-/merge_requests/363), the specific attack vector through tiffcrop and tiffsplit was not explicitly mentioned in the original description of CVE-2022-34526, therefore it should at least be mentioned in the CVE description. The vulnerability also appears to be caused by a combination of integer overflows and out-of-bounds read/writes.",
        "remediation": "NetApp has released patches for affected products. Specifically, Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere and ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility. Users should upgrade to the specified versions to address the vulnerability.",
    "affected_products": "Multiple NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability including but not limited to: Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere and ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility."
