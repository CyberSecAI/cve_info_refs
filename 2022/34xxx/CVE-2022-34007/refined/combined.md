# The Pitfalls of Closed-Source Whistleblowing Software

**5 August 2022**

*WIN is delighted to publish this Spotlight by Giovanni Pellerano, a computer engineer and whistleblowing hacktivist. Giovanni co-founded GlobaLeaks, a software that provides flexible and secure gateways for journalists, individuals, and NGOs to enable whistleblowing.*

Since founding the free and open-source whistleblowing software, [GlobaLeaks](https://www.globaleaks.org/), I am often asked by organisations to have a review and comment on the various proprietary whistleblowing solutions software being advertised to organisations.

When tasked with this, I find it more professional to avoid talking about the specifics of the technology because - as voluntary external auditors -we have no way of offering concrete solutions without risking criticism. Instead, I push the value of [open-source software](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), explaining that much-needed trust can be built over time, based on continuous peer review of such software, as well as the availability of track records of edits and independent audits, made possible by opting for open-source technology

However, I was recently approached by a partner anticorruption NGO to give my assessment of the whistleblowing platform of the European Commission called the [EU Sanctions Whistleblower Tool](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/international-relations/restrictive-measures-sanctions/overview-sanctions-and-related-tools_en) – to facilitate anonymous reporting of sanctions violations - developed on the basis of the Integrity Line software by EQS Group AG. At first, I replied with my ‘go-to’ arguments, pointing out that with a technology like this, we could not provide any real evaluation because - as citizens and users - we have no way to peer review the technology without hacking it, which is illegal.

**Read more:** [European Commission introduces EU Sanctions Whistleblower Tool](https://sanctionsnews.bakermckenzie.com/european-commission-introduces-eu-sanctions-whistleblower-tool/)

However, on considering the widespread adoption of this technology and the growing risks for whistleblowers if the software is not as secure as advertised, coupled with my experience with responsible security audits, I decided that it was worth attempting to ethically “hack” and therefore verify the purported security of the platform.

**Read more:** [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure)

The result was not what I expected. Within minutes of starting my review, I found that the technology was suffering from a major vulnerability - and without any possible mitigation of the risks its exploitation - thus making the software extraordinarily, and worryingly, insecure.

Following what is known as a “responsible disclosure procedure,” I contacted the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research and Engineering](https://www.mitre.org/about/our-history) (MITRE) asking for support in the analysis of the insecurity I had uncovered and for their advice on proper ways to contact to the vendor. MITRE confirmed and acknowledged the relevance of the vulnerability and issued a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure ID ([CVE-2022-34007](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34007)) to organise for a proper vulnerability disclosure after full remediation by the vendor. I then tried to contact the vendor of this technology by looking for a confidential reporting procedure which we typical when implementing open-source projects to try to follow security best practices. I discovered the company had also not implemented such a dedicated security channel. I had to therefore contact the vendor via email, and file a [security audit report](https://www.ush.it/team/ush/advisory-eqs-integrity-line/eqs_integrity_line.txt), informing them of my findings and offering guidance on how to fix and improve the security of their technology:

I would like to stress that the identified problems found are not unique to the EQS Integrity Line software. Every system has, or will have, bugs which can occur regardless of whether the software is closed-source or open-source. However, with open-source software, as is widely known and expressed by the open-source community, we are able to see a) when a bug was added b) how and when it was fixed, and, importantly, we can continue to monitor for any ongoing vulnerabilities with continuous peer review. With closed-source software, however, we only know that critical information when the company chooses to publicly disclose that an issue has happened and that it was somehow fixed -  and users have no way of knowing the exact remediation implemented, nor how it could impact the software.

I believe this is an important issue to raise - not to just talk about this technology in particular - but to open a public discussion, and stress the requirement that whistleblowing software should be open-source.

It is not a problem if a software has an issue as long as the issue is swiftly and responsibly resolved. And it doesn't matter if the software is privately and commercially licensed or if it is freely available, as long the code utilised by that software is open source and publicly auditable.

It is my firm opinion - and I would say common to the whistleblower protection community - that whistleblowers deserve maximum security and care, and that this is only possible by increasing the contribution and the capacity for peer review of the best practices that we build, recommend and implement. For this reason, I believe that all interested whistleblower activists, and lawyers, users and developers should be included in this discussion and have full access to the details of whistleblowing technology.  This is an important safeguard and catalyst for innovations and improvement and one of the major advantages of technologies like [GlobaLeaks](https://www.globaleaks.org/) - for which I stand.

**A comment from the WIN Team:**

*Whistleblowers are the first to spot when wrongdoing has occurred and may be the only witness to malpractice. Often, when a whistleblower is considering resorting to anonymous reporting, they have very real risk of retaliation. As Giovanni points out – whistleblowers deserve the upmost care and security – any promise of identity protection must be as secure as advertised to be.*

*Whistleblowers can face professional and personal risks and may not have any alternatives to silence. Anonymous reporting platforms can be an important tool to encourage whistleblowers to speak up and are being increasingly acknowledged in legal frameworks, and by employers looking to encourage staff to raise concerns of malpractice. In 2019, WIN hosted its inaugural conference and invited whistleblowing practitioners and NGOs from around the world to discuss the practices they have developed to support and defend whistleblowers – including the folks at GlobaLeaks, which has been an important tool adopted by many WIN members to encourage hesitant reporters to make contact and seek advice without exposing their identity before they are comfortable.

It has been impossible to ignore the burgeoning number of whistleblowing solution services which have flooded the market. Whilst these will have a place in a national or institutional whistleblowing framework – to properly advise whistleblowers, we need these commercial ventures – increasingly adopted by public authorities - to ensure transparency and accountability in their systems, to uphold the public’s right to know public interest information – and to avoid undermining the necessary trust and confidence in systems to promote witnesses to come forward and stop risk of harm.*

EQS Integrity Line: Multiple Vulnerabilities
Name Multiple Vulnerabilities in EQS Integrity Line
Systems Affected EQS Integrity Line through 2022-07-01
Severity High
Impact (CVSSv2) High 8.8/10, score: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Vendor EQS Group AG (https://www.eqs.com/)
Advisory http://www.ush.it/team/ush/advisory-eqs-integrity-line/eqs\_integrity\_line.txt
Authors Giovanni "evilaliv3" Pellerano (evilaliv3 AT ush DOT it)
Date 20220706
I. BACKGROUND
EQS Integrity Line is a proprietary whistleblowing software which enables
employees to report misconduct such as corruption, abuses of power and
discrimination internally before complaints become public and, in serious
cases, result in financial losses as well as reputational damage.
II. DESCRIPTION
Multiple Vulnerabilities exist in EQS Integrity Line software.
The present advisory highlights two distinct vulnerabilities, namely (A)
XSS Vulnerability (stored) [CVE-2022-34007] and (B) Use of GET Request
Method With Sensitive Query Strings [CWE-598].
III. ANALYSIS
A) XSS Vulnerability (stored) [CVE-2022-34007]
EQS Integrity Line through 2022-07-01 allows a stored XSS via a crafted
whistleblower entry.
In order to exploit this vulnerability no account is required on the
whistleblowing software.
The vulnerability resides in the whistleblowing questionnaire
implementation that enables anonymous, non authenticated, users to inject
malicious XSS vectors due to missing or improper input sanitization.
Also content security policies (CSP) that could prevent or limit the attack
are absent.
The vulnerability is present on the whistleblowing form, and can be
triggered using the following example input:
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
![](onerror=alert(document.cookie))
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
Due to the vulnerability, an attacker posing as a whistleblower could
upload an XSS vector in the submission form loading malicious code to be
reflected and executed in the context of the browser session of the
Recipient of the submission, that is typically an Anticorruption Officer
or an Internal Auditor.
Being able to execute code in the context of the target, and due to the
absence of additional mitigations (e.g. the HttpOnly flag for cookies)
the attacker could possibly obtain a copy of the target session cookie
useful to impersonate and operate in place of the target user and
execute automated operations on behalf of the target user by accessing
all the reports present on the system or possibly impact the integrity
of the system by deleting reports or interfering with ongoing
communications with a real whistleblower.
In short: a standard XSS attack scenario.
The test for the presence of this vulnerability has been performed on the
first input only, to not risk to cause any damage to the application.
It is advised to execute a proper complete audit of the application with
respect to this kind of vulnerability.
The vulnerability was first identified performing an independent security
audit to evaluate and ensure the security of the EU Sanctions Whistleblower
Tool of the European Commission enabling whistleblowers to report possible
violation of EU sanctions hosted at:
https://eusanctions.integrityline.com/
B) Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings [CWE-598]
EQS Integrity Line through 2022-07-01 leaves sensitive traces in the browser
history of whistleblowers using the application and possibly in the logs
of other network appliances involved in the communication.
When a whistleblower makes a submission, the system assigns a unique
identifier to the submission and enables to choose a pin that is intended
to be used by users in combination with the unique identifier to access
the system in order to communicate with the recipients of their own report.
The implementation of the session makes use of GET variables that include
the unique identifier in the navigated URL to access the report.
Such an implementation is prone to sensible information leakage making it
possible for an auditor accessing the browser history of the
whistleblower's device to clearly identify the evidence of a performed
submission.
It is advised to perform full review of the application to get sure that
the application reduces the sensible traces left in the browser history of
the user.
IV. WORKAROUND
The vendor has fixed the XSS and implemented a CSP in date 2022-07-01
V. CVE INFORMATION
XSS Vulnerability (stored) [CVE-2022-34007]
Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings [CWE-598]
VI. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE
20220617 USH: Bugs discovered
20220617 USH: Contacted Mitre for CVE Assignment
20220621 USH: First vendor contact (Lorenzo Trevisiol, Laura Santeusanio)
20220622 USH: Advisory provided to the vendor (Goran Kozomara)
20220701 Vendor response: XSS confirmed and CSP implemented (Marco Ermini)
The vendor does not acknowledge the second reported vulnerability
in the specific context of use but has planned future improvement
the application of the application replacing the GET request with
a POST request.
20220701 USH: The team confirms prompt and effective remediation of the
XSS vulnerability but points out suboptimal CSP implementation.
The implementation seems to involve a central proxy or device and
to always include a list of 10 vendor clients and other third
parties CDN probably used for other reasons different from the
audited integrity line app (e.g. bootstrap CDN). The team advises
to implement a policy per-site and app to avoid listing sensible
resources and limit any possible exposure.

A company unlike any other

MITRE was established to advance national security in new ways and serve the public interest as an independent adviser. We continue to deliver on that promise every day, applying our systems-thinking approach to provide solutions that enhance our national security and way of life.

Our mission-driven people come to work at MITRE to make a difference. We give them that opportunity by fostering a vibrant and diverse community of thought that drives a culture of innovation. Our non-profit status sets us apart. Motivated by impact, our people discover new possibilities, create unexpected opportunities, and lead as pioneers for the public good.

Fast Company called us “[the most important company you’ve never heard of.](https://www.fastcompany.com/3017927/30mitre)” But even if you don’t know our name, you have experienced our impact. In our 65+ years of catalyzing and sustaining change, we never lose sight of the human factor behind every complex system and innovative solution.

MITRE’s mission-driven teams are dedicated to solving problems for a safer world. Through our public-private partnerships and federally funded R&D centers, we work across government and in partnership with industry and academia to tackle challenges.
