The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-34191.

**Vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerabilities in multiple plugins providing additional parameter types

**CVE-2022-34191:** Specifically affects the `NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher` plugin.

* **Root Cause:** The plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.
* **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization. The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input (parameter name and description) before rendering it in the UI, allowing the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript.
* **Impact:**  Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts. When a user views a page displaying this parameter (e.g., "Build with Parameters"), the injected script will execute in their browser. This allows for arbitrary actions on the Jenkins instance within the user's session, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or further attacks.
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker would need to configure a job in Jenkins and insert malicious HTML/Javascript in the name or description of a parameter provided by the vulnerable plugin.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs Item/Configure permission to set up a job and the malicious parameter.

**Affected plugin:**
* `cavisson-ns-nd-integration` (NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher) 4.8.0.77 and earlier.

**Additional Notes:**
* This vulnerability is part of a larger class of similar XSS vulnerabilities affecting multiple Jenkins plugins.
* The advisory notes that Jenkins core and some plugins have mitigations against these issues in specific pages, but these mitigations may not apply to all contexts.
* A fix for this plugin is not available at the time of the advisory publication.
