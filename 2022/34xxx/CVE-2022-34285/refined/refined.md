- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer when parsing PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to leak information in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring the user to open a malicious PCB file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted PCB file. User interaction (UI:R) is required. No privileges are required (PR:N).
