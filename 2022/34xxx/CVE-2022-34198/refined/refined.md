Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information regarding **CVE-2022-34198**:

**CVE-2022-34198** is associated with **SECURITY-2725**.

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Plugin:** Stash Branch Parameter Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 0.3.0 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The Stash Branch Parameter plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter type it provides.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient output sanitization/escaping
*   **Impact:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code, leading to potential information theft, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.
*  **Attack Vector:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can configure a job with a Stash Branch Parameter that contains malicious code in the parameter name or description. When this parameter is displayed on a page, like the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages, the injected code will be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have `Item/Configure` permission.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to configure a job that uses the vulnerable parameter type.
    *   The vulnerability is exploitable on pages that display the configured parameters, such as the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages (provided those pages are not hardened to prevent XSS as noted in the description).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Jenkins core has mitigations in place to prevent exploitation of this type of vulnerability on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since versions 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2.
*   Other plugins have also been previously updated to prevent exploitation by default, as referenced in the description.
*   As of the publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for the Stash Branch Parameter Plugin.
