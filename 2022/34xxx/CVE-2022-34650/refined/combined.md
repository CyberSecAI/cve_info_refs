I looked through plenty of plugins to display our team the way I wanted and there was always something missing. This one has it all: a great grid, pop-up more info on each person, nicely displayed social icons, additional fields for skills and more info. Really cool and super easy to use!
The only two little things that were missing in our experience were:
1) some customisable features are not responsive (like font size of colour, even in the pro version)
2) we needed some additional customisation, like removing animation, changing titles of additional fields, etc.
The plug-in support has helped us with everything adding code directly on the site! Super helpful and nice, definitely recommended üôÇ

The plugin has several options with which one can modify the look of it. I especially want to complement the great support I got. I asked whether it would be possible to get a new feature to the plugin and it didn‚Äôt take long and they had updated the plugin to include the requested feature. Great plugin and a great team behind it!

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
