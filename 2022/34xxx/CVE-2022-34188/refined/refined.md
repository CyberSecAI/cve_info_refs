Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-34188:

**CVE-2022-34188**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Plugin:** Hidden Parameter Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 0.0.4 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The Hidden Parameter plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter type it provides.
*  **Weaknesses:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the parameter name and description. This lack of proper encoding or sanitization allows malicious scripts to be stored and later executed in a user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious JavaScript into the parameter name or description. When these parameters are displayed on pages like "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" (if these pages are not hardened), the injected script will execute in the context of the user viewing the page. This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser session, leading to potential account compromise or other attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker must have the Item/Configure permission on a Jenkins project to configure a job with the vulnerable parameter type and inject the malicious script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials and Item/Configure permission to a Jenkins project. They also need to be able to craft a malicious payload that will execute as JavaScript in a victim's browser.
*   **Mitigation:** This vulnerability is fixed in Hidden Parameter Plugin version 0.0.5, which escapes the parameter type name and description. Users of the plugin are advised to update. Note that Jenkins (core) has already mitigated the impact of this kind of XSS on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since version 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2, as part of fix for SECURITY-353/CVE-2017-2601.
