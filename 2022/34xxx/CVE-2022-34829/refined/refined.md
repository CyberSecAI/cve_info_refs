Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-34829

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A vulnerable payload sent to the Mobile App Deployment API causes the application to restart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The Mobile App Deployment API did not properly handle certain payloads, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The application restarts each time a vulnerable payload is sent to the Mobile App Deployment API.
*   This constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, disrupting the availability of the ADSelfService Plus application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a specially crafted payload sent to the Mobile App Deployment API.
*   The specific method of sending this malicious payload to the API is not detailed in the provided document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the capability to send requests to the Mobile App Deployment API endpoint.
*   The attacker does not necessarily require authentication to trigger the vulnerability; this is based on the description that sending a vulnerable payload causes the application to restart. The details do not specify if authentication is required to access this API, although such assumptions are unlikely.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects ADSelfService Plus builds 6202 and below.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in build 6203, released on June 30, 2022, by restricting the API from processing vulnerable payloads.
*   The vulnerability was reported through the Zoho BugBounty program by Skay.
