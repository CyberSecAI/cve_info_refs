Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Wholesale Suite plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin suffers from a broken access control vulnerability, specifically related to missing authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically a "Subscriber" role) can potentially perform actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact of this is not detailed, but could include unauthorized modifications or access to data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a vulnerable function within the plugin that lacks proper access control mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be a subscriber, which is a low-level user role in WordPress. This implies that the vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit, given the low privilege requirements.
