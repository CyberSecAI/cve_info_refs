| Following is the test case we use, in this program we add a breakpoint to the 0x80000178 and specify the size field is 3. This is possible because the manual specifies that the fields in mcontrol are WARL, so users may try to write the value they expected(0x200000000003005c), then we try to access 0x80000178, and the log shows that the emulation suddenly stops at 0x80000174.  ``` core   0: 0x0000000080000140 (0x00000593) li      a1, 0 core   0: 0x0000000080000144 (0x7a059073) csrw    tselect, a1 core   0: 0x0000000080000148 (0x00000597) auipc   a1, 0x0 core   0: 0x000000008000014c (0x03058593) addi    a1, a1, 48 core   0: 0x0000000080000150 (0x7a259073) csrw    tdata2, a1 core   0: 0x0000000080000154 (0x7a2025f3) csrr    a1, tdata2 : reg 0 a1  ->  0x0000000080000178 core   0: 0x0000000080000158 (0x0010059b) addiw   a1, zero, 1 core   0: 0x000000008000015c (0x02d59593) slli    a1, a1, 45 core   0: 0x0000000080000160 (0x00358593) addi    a1, a1, 3 core   0: 0x0000000080000164 (0x01059593) slli    a1, a1, 16 core   0: 0x0000000080000168 (0x05c58593) addi    a1, a1, 92 core   0: 0x000000008000016c (0x7a159073) csrw    tdata1, a1 : reg 0 a1 -> 0x200000000003005c    (action was set to 48 here) core   0: 0x0000000080000170 (0x7a1025f3) csrr    a1, tdata1 core   0: 0x0000000080000174 (0x00100193) li      gp, 1 [exit simulation]  ```  [spike-1.zip](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim/files/8926704/spike-1.zip) |

| This is definitely a bug, easily fixed by using the CSR\_MCONTROL\_ACTION macro instead of MCONTROL\_ACTION (which is out-of-date) in triggers.cc. But I've got a bunch of other stuff going on and it will take a while before I get to this. |

| I believe this misbehavior was fixed by [7965f25](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim/commit/7965f25acb4fbf99817c1a5c3aef0ce1843b6bc5) as part of [#1128](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim/pull/1128) (even though `encoding.h` still has an incorrect value for MCONTROL\_ACTION).  [@Phantom1003](https://github.com/Phantom1003) can you please confirm? |
