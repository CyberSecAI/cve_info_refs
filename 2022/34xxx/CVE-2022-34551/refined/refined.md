The provided content describes a relative path traversal vulnerability in the `sims` project.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the filename parameter in the `downloadServlet`, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path and access files outside the intended directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or system files such as `/etc/passwd` and backup files.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests to the `downloadServlet` by manipulating the `filename` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which is a remote attack vector.
