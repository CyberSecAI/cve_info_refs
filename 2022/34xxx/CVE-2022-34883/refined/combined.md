## Interim action

Workaround for vulnerability i):

- Do not use characters other than the usable characters described below for the following information registered in the "Add Array Manager" window of SRM.

<Registered information>

✔ IP address or host name of the RAID Manager server

✔ Username for connecting to the RAID Manager server using SSH

✔ Password for connecting to the RAID Manager server using SSH

<Usable characters>
   One-byte alphanumeric characters and the following symbols
   Hyphen (-), comma (,), period (.), colon (:), at mark (@), underscore (\_), slash (/)

- The password might be already recorded in the SRM log files. Delete the log files by using the following procedure.
    Notes:

* This procedure deletes the log file.
* If other problems occur on the SRM server, resolve them, and then perform the procedure.
* Do not perform any operation, such as registration or recovery, on SRM during the procedure.

<Procedure for deleting log files (for Docker RMSRA)>

1. Restart the SRM server.
2. Enable an SSH access to the SRM server. For the procedure, see the following web page:

   <https://docs.vmware.com/en/Site-Recovery-Manager/8.5/com.vmware.srm.install_config.doc/GUID-DAB15876-4376-4D4B-A90A-1C54524685AE.html>
3. Log in to the SRM server using SSH. (Use the admin user and the password you have set at the time of deployment.)
4. Run the su command to become a root user.
5. Run the following command to move to the log directory:

     cd /var/log/vmware/srm
6. Run the following command to check if the password is recorded in the archived log file:

     gunzip -c vmware-dr-<file generation number>.log.gz | grep " sh:" | wc -l
7. If the output result of Step 6 is 1 or greater, the password might be recorded. Delete the log file by running the following command:

     rm vmware-dr-<file generation number>.log.gz

<Procedure for deleting log files (for Windows RMSRA)>

1. Restart the SRM server.
2. Access the SRM server as a user with administrator privileges by using a remote desktop connection.
3. Open the explorer and move to the following directory:

     <SRM installation drive>:

     \ProgramData\VMware\VMware vCenter Site Recovery Manager\Logs
4. Copy the .gz archive log file to another directory.
     Name of the file to be copied:

     vmware-dr-<file generation number>.log.gz
5. Prepare a tool that decompresses the .gz archive log file that you copied in Step 4 and decompress the log file.
6. Run the following command at the command prompt and check if the password is recorded in the decompressed log file:

     find "operable program or batch file." vmware-dr-<file generation number>.log
7. If an applicable part is output as a result of the command in Step 6, the password might be recorded. Delete the archived log file stored in the log directory.

     Log directory name:

     <SRM installation drive>:

     \ProgramData\VMware\VMware vCenter Site Recovery Manager\Logs

      File name:

     vmware-dr-<file generation number>.log.gz

<Procedure for deleting log (for both Docker/Windows RMSRA)>

    If a log transfer setting and the like is configured on the SRM server, run the same check for transferred logs and delete logs as necessary.

Workaround for vulnerability ii):

    Closely manage access rights to SRM.
