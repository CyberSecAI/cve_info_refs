| **Impact of the bug** Malicious code execution  **Describe the bug** There are a release candidates of wmagent (<https://pypi.org/project/wmagent/1.3.3rc2/#history>) In 1.3.3rc2 and 1.3.3rc1 there is a `requirements.txt` file with this content:  ``` # All dependencies needed to run WMAgent Cheetah==2.4.0 Markdown==3.0.1 MySQL-python==1.2.5 SQLAlchemy==1.3.3 Sphinx==1.3.5 cx-Oracle==5.2.1 dbs-client==3.7.8 decorator==3.4.2 future==0.16.0 httplib2==0.7.3 psutil==5.6.6 py==1.7.0 pyOpenSSL==18.0.0 pycurl-client==3.7.8 pycurl==7.19.3 python-cjson==1.2.1 pyzmq==17.1.2 retry==0.9.1 stomp.py==4.1.15 rucio-clients==1.19.3  ```  These dependencies will be installed by `setup.py`:  ``` ... requirements = "requirements.txt"  ... setup(name='wmagent',       version=wmcore_version,       maintainer='CMS DMWM Group',       maintainer_email='hn-cms-dmDevelopment@cern.ch',       package_dir={'': 'src/python/'},       packages=list_packages(['src/python/Utils',                               'src/python/WMCore',                               'src/python/WMComponent',                               'src/python/WMQuality',                               'src/python/PSetTweaks']),       data_files=list_static_files(),       install_requires=parse_requirements(requirements),       url="https://github.com/dmwm/WMCore",       license="Apache License, Version 2.0",       )   ```  `dbs-client` does not exist in pypi yet:  ``` python3 -m pip install dbs-client ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement dbs-client (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for dbs-client  ```  The problem: the intruder can create malicious `dbs-client` package on pypi and it will be installed by our package users.  **Solution**: Need to delete these potential unsafe packages from pypi. |

| [@rakovskij-stanislav](https://github.com/rakovskij-stanislav) Hi Rakovskij, thank you very much for reporting this issue. I think those versions were the first ones to be uploaded to PyPi when we were commissioning this build/upload process.  [@goughes](https://github.com/goughes) could you please check how we can remove a given package version from PyPi (I think we can mark them as DELETED). Once you know what the changes are required, I'd suggest to mark anything that is below 2.0.x version as deleted/deprecated, whatever is needed to tell Pypi not to download that version. |

| The old (test) PyPi releases have been deleted yesterday and an up-to-date wmagent release has been built and uploaded to PyPi (version 2.0.4). Thanks! I think this issue can now be closed, but in case we missed anything, please do let us know. Thanks again Stanislav for reporting this problem! |
