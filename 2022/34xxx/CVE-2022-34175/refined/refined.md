Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-34175:

**CVE-2022-34175**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   In Jenkins 2.335 through 2.355 (inclusive), the protection added for SECURITY-534 is disabled for some views. This allows attackers to bypass permission checks and directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information. The issue stems from the Stapler web framework used by Jenkins for rendering UI views, which are composed of view fragments that plugins can extend.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Authorization:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the protection mechanism from a previous fix (SECURITY-534) was disabled for certain views, leading to unauthorized access to view fragments.
    *   **Bypassed Permission Checks**: Attackers can directly access view fragments, bypassing the intended permission checks in the corresponding view.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information contained within view fragments.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attackers can directly access the view fragment containing sensitive information by crafting a specific request, bypassing the view's permission checks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No specific user privileges are needed; the attacker can be unauthenticated.
    *   The attacker must have knowledge of the view fragment's structure and how to access it directly.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Jenkins security team is not aware of any vulnerable view fragments in the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.
*   No Jenkins LTS release is affected by this issue. The vulnerability was introduced in Jenkins 2.335 and fixed in the 2.346.x line before 2.346.1.
*  Jenkins version 2.356 restores the protection for affected views.
