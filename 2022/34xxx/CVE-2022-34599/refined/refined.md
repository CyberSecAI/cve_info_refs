The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34599.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. It occurs due to the `getElement` function splitting strings in the `Edittriggerlist` interface. The function attempts to split strings into a buffer `v6` of size 20, but the function does not limit the size of the split string, while also having an internal limit of 64.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow. The `getElement` function does not check the size of the input before splitting the string into the `v6` buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service by crashing the device.
- It allows for arbitrary code execution via a crafted POST request, and can lead to the attacker gaining a stable root shell without authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint.
- Specifically, providing an overly long string in the `param` parameter of the `EdittriggerList` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to know the device's IP address.
- No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
