Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-34477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of the `MediaError` message property when dealing with cross-origin resources. Specifically, for same-site cross-origin resources (those on the same domain but different ports), the detailed error message could be exposed. This contrasts with the intended behavior, where all cross-origin errors should result in a generic "Failed to open media" message to prevent information leakage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of specific error messages related to cross-origin media requests, which can leak information about the existence and state of resources on the same site but different origin.
*   **XS-Leaks:** The leaked error messages can be exploited to perform XS-Leaks attacks, such as login detection or other forms of cross-site information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to:

*   **Detect the presence of resources:** By observing the specific error messages, an attacker could determine if a specific media resource exists on a cross-origin page of the same site.
*   **Infer resource states:** The nature of the error messages (e.g., "404: File not found" vs. "Request failed") could leak details about the state or availability of the resource, further aiding attackers.
*  **Login Detection:** This vulnerability could be exploited to detect if a user is logged into a service on a different port of the same domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host a malicious website that attempts to load media resources from a different port of the same domain.
*   **Cross-origin Requests:** The attack relies on cross-origin requests, specifically media loading, from a different port within the same site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a webpage:** The attacker needs the ability to host a webpage that can perform the cross-origin media requests.
*   **Target must visit malicious site:**  The user must visit a page controlled by the attacker.
*   **Knowledge of target resource:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific media resources they wish to probe for or attempt to load.
*   **Same-site target:** The target resource must be on the same site as the malicious page but on a different port or subdomain (though subdomain case was fixed).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that `MediaError` messages are generic ("Failed to open media") for all cross-origin requests, regardless of whether the origin is same-site or not.
*   The bug report includes test cases (`firefox_media_error.html`, `firefox_media_error2.html`) demonstrating the information leak.
*   The initial fix was not applied to same-site pages with different ports, which was the vulnerability for this CVE.
*   The fix was not applied to Firefox ESR 91 branch.
