Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-34035:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The provided content is related to a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability described in issue #426 of the `htmldoc` project, which was fixed in commit `ee77825`. While the content does not explicitly state it is related to CVE-2022-34035, the description matches the vulnerability details in the provided github content. Therefore, it can be assumed to be related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `write_node` function within `htmldoc/html.cxx`. Specifically, the code attempts to access the last character of a string using `t->data[strlen((char *)t->data) - 1]` without checking if the string is empty. When `t->data` is empty, `strlen()` returns 0, leading to an attempt to access `t->data[-1]`, which results in a heap-buffer-overflow.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow due to incorrect index calculation.
- **Lack of input validation:** There's a lack of a check to ensure that the string `t->data` is not empty before accessing the last character.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash of the `htmldoc` application due to the memory access violation, as reported by the AddressSanitizer.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:** While the provided context highlights a crash, a heap-buffer-overflow can be a stepping stone for more severe attacks, including arbitrary code execution, in other contexts.

**5. Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML Input:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML file that causes an empty string to be passed as `t->data` to the vulnerable `write_node` function.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability occurs during the processing of HTML files by the `htmldoc` application, meaning an attacker would need to have the application process their malicious file.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an HTML file to the `htmldoc` application, either as a file path parameter or through another input mechanism.
- **No special privileges:** Exploitation does not require any special privileges on the system and can occur when a regular user attempts to process a malicious file.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was discovered using AddressSanitizer.
- The vulnerable code snippet is found in  `htmldoc/html.cxx` line 588.
- Similar logic was also present in  `htmldoc/htmllib.cxx` (line 1602) and `htmldoc/htmlsep.cxx` (line 591)
- The fix involved adding a check to ensure that the string is not empty before accessing its last character using `t->data[0] && t->data[strlen((char *)t->data) - 1] == '\n'`
