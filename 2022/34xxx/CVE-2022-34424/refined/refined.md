- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is triggered by running particular security scans on the affected system. The specific nature of these scans or the underlying cause within the OS10 software is not detailed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A vulnerability exists that causes a system crash when specific security scans are performed. This suggests a weakness in how the system handles or responds to these particular scans.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, specifically a system crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), and does not require any special privileges or user interaction (PR:N, UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send the specific security scans over the network. No authentication or user interaction is required.
