Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the direct use of user-controlled input (`$page_size`) in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Time-Based SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code that includes time-delaying functions (like `sleep()`) to infer information about the database.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input before incorporating it into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by crafting specific time-delaying SQL injection payloads. This includes database schema, user information, application data, and potentially other sensitive details.
*   **Potential for Data Modification/Deletion:** While the provided information focuses on time-based injection, SQL injection vulnerabilities in general can lead to data modification or even deletion, depending on the database permissions of the account the application is using to connect to the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific PHP endpoints:
    *   `/load_data_for_groups.php`
    *   `/load_data_for_topusers.php`
*   **Manipulated `$page_size` Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `$page_size` parameter within the HTTP request to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
*   **Understanding of HTTP and SQL:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL syntax to craft the malicious payloads.
*  **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter**: The attacker needs to know that the `$page_size` parameter is vulnerable

**Additional Notes:**
* The reported vulnerability exists in two different files `/load_data_for_groups.php` and `/load_data_for_topusers.php`
* The provided proof of concept (POC) code shows that when a sleep command is injected as part of the page size, the server takes significantly longer to respond, confirming a time based SQL injection vulnerability.
* The report indicates that the application is running on Ubuntu 14.04, PHP 5.5.9, and MySQL 5.5.62.
*  It is also mentioned that the Kliqqi CMS has been discontinued since 2018, therefore there will be no updates to fix this vulnerability.
