Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a malicious backdoor embedded within the `request` package, which was present in versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 of the `perdido` project hosted on PyPI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Supply chain vulnerability: The project was compromised by including a malicious dependency (`request` package).
- Malicious package: The `request` package in versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 contained a backdoor that enabled code execution.
- Mirror site persistence: Although the malicious package was removed from the main PyPI repository, it persisted on mirror sites allowing for continued installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The malicious backdoor within the `request` package allowed for the execution of arbitrary code on systems where the vulnerable versions of `perdido` were installed. This could result in a wide range of malicious activities, such as data theft, system compromise, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Dependency installation: Attackers could install the malicious version of `perdido` using `pip` and specifying a mirror site that had not removed the malicious `request` package. For example, the report specifies the use of `pip install perdido==0.0.2 -i http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple --trusted-host pypi.doubanio.com` to install the malicious package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and publish packages to PyPI (or a similar repository).
- Ability to create and upload a malicious `request` package.
- Knowledge of how to use mirror sites and trust them, bypassing default PyPI security measures.
- Ability to trick users into installing the compromised `perdido` package.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported on Jun 14, 2022, and closed on Jun 17, 2022.
- The `perdido` project maintainer was notified and took action by closing the issue, likely deleting the malicious versions from PyPI, but the report points out that not all mirrors have purged the package.
- The vulnerability highlights the risk of supply chain attacks and the importance of verifying dependencies and being cautious when using mirror sites.
