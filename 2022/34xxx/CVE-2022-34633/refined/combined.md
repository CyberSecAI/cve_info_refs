from [#876](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/876), this patch passed the testcase in the report.

The original design reset the illegal\_instr during privilege check, use the previous value instead 0.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[Phantom1003](/Phantom1003)** commented [May 15, 2022](#issue-1236221321)

| Hi, we are currently doing some co-simulation with cva6 and spike, and we found the decoder has an incorrect behavior when meeting a sfence.vma with non-zero rd field.  According to the ISA Specification (Volume II: RISC-V Privileged Architectures V20211203 Page 152) for the SFENCE.VMA format, instr[11:7] should be 5'b00000.  When modified instr[11:7] to 5'b00001. cva6 treats this instruction as SFENCE.VMA as well. No exception occurred. The implementation is missing a check for this field.     [cva6/core/decoder.sv](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/44a89b9cd408b869fb4ed2c0cec35e1561588e37/core/decoder.sv#L152-L165)  Lines 152 to 165 in [44a89b9](/openhwgroup/cva6/commit/44a89b9cd408b869fb4ed2c0cec35e1561588e37)   |  | // SFENCE.VMA | | --- | --- | |  | default: begin | |  | if (instr.instr[31:25] == 7'b1001) begin | |  | // check privilege level, SFENCE.VMA can only be executed in M/S mode | |  | // otherwise decode an illegal instruction | |  | illegal\_instr = (priv\_lvl\_i inside {riscv::PRIV\_LVL\_M, riscv::PRIV\_LVL\_S}) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1; | |  | instruction\_o.op = ariane\_pkg::SFENCE\_VMA; | |  | // check TVM flag and intercept SFENCE.VMA call if necessary | |  | if (priv\_lvl\_i == riscv::PRIV\_LVL\_S && tvm\_i) | |  | illegal\_instr = 1'b1; | |  | end else begin | |  | illegal\_instr = 1'b1; | |  | end | |  | end |      In the following test case, there is an invalid sfence.vma at 0x80000190, whose rd field is 1, cva6 execute it as normal instruction, while spike throws an excaption.  ```   [cva6] 532890ns    26637 M 000000008000018c 0 12000073 sfence.vma    [spike] core   0: 0x000000008000018c (0x12000073) sfence.vma zero, zero                            [cva6] 534950ns    26740 M 0000000080000190 0 120000f3 sfence.vma       [spike] core   0: 0x0000000080000190 (0x120000f3) unknown   [spike] core   0: exception trap_illegal_instruction, epc 0x0000000080000190   [spike] core   0:           tval 0x0000000000000000  ```  [cva6-0.zip](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/8694534/cva6-0.zip)  @LuminaDCIX helps reproduce the problem |
