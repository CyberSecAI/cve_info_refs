- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing specially crafted PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a specially crafted PCB file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PCB file. The attacker must be able to create and deliver a specially crafted PCB file.
