Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A malicious backdoor was introduced into the `dr-web-engine` project within versions `0.2.0b0` to `0.2.6.0b0`. This backdoor was embedded within the `request` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Supply Chain Attack:** The core issue is a malicious package (`request`) being included in the project's dependencies, effectively poisoning the supply chain.
- **Dependency Confusion:** Although the malicious package was removed from PyPI, it remained on mirror sites, which allowed it to still be installed through specific commands using `--trusted-host` option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The presence of the malicious backdoor within the `request` package likely allowed for arbitrary code execution on systems where the affected versions of `dr-web-engine` were installed. This could lead to full system compromise.
- **Data theft/modification:** Backdoors can allow malicious actors to steal or modify data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Publicly Available Mirrors:** The attack vector was leveraging the persistence of malicious packages on mirror sites even after their removal from the primary PyPI repository.
- **`pip install` with `--trusted-host`:**  Specifically, the command `pip install dr-web-engine==0.2.6.0b0 -i http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple --trusted-host pypi.doubanio.com` was used to successfully install the compromised package from a mirror.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needed to be able to introduce a modified `request` package into the project's dependency.
- The attacker needed to understand how to abuse mirror sites and use `pip install` with `--trusted-host`.
- The attacker needed to know that the malicious package remained available on mirror sites.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text suggests the maintainers removed the compromised releases from PyPI.
- The issue was closed as 'completed' after the malicious releases were removed, which means the immediate risk has been mitigated but doesn't address the underlying vulnerability of supply chain compromise.
