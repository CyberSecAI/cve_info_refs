- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read when parsing PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads specially crafted PCB files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PCB file with the affected application. The attacker would also need to create or modify a PCB file to trigger the vulnerability.
