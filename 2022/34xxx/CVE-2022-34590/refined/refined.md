{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `editid` parameter of the `/HMS/admin.php` endpoint, leading to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data leakage, modification, or deletion. In this case, the attacker was able to retrieve the database name.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `/HMS/admin.php` with a maliciously crafted `editid` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific user privileges appear to be needed for successful exploitation."
