Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of a malicious "request" package (note the singular form) in version 0.1 of the `bin_collection` project, which was available on PyPI and mirror sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Typosquatting/Dependency Confusion:** The malicious package "request" is likely a typo of the legitimate "requests" package. This can trick users into installing the malicious package instead of the intended one.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:** The malicious package was uploaded to PyPI or a mirror site, enabling an attacker to distribute malware to users who install it as a dependency of `bin_collection`.
*   **Incomplete Removal of Malicious Package:** Even after the malicious package was removed from the primary PyPI repository, some mirror sites may not have removed the package, allowing it to persist and potentially infect more users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The malicious "request" package is described as a "malicious backdoor," indicating it could allow arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the `bin_collection` package is installed.
*   **Compromise of User Systems:** Successful exploitation could lead to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities, depending on the attacker's intentions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Dependency Installation:** The attack vector involves users installing the vulnerable version 0.1 of `bin_collection` using pip. When a user installs the package, the malicious `request` dependency is pulled from PyPI or a mirror site.
*  **Mirror Site Propagation**: Attackers are exploiting mirror sites to propagate the malicious package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **PyPI/Mirror Site Access:** The attacker needs to have been able to upload the malicious "request" package to PyPI or a mirror site.
*   **Typosquatting Expertise:** The attacker must have been aware of the legitimate package "requests" and able to leverage a common typo ("request") to trick users.
*  **Awareness of Mirror Sites**: The attacker must know that mirror sites are used by some users and that these sites often do not delete malicious packages as quickly as the main repository.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported on June 20, 2022.
*   The vulnerability specifically affects version 0.1 of the `bin_collection` project.
*   The suggested fix is to delete the vulnerable version from PyPI and replace the dependency on the "request" package with the legitimate "requests" package.
*   The reported mentions the use of a specific mirror site, "http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple", and that the malicious package could still be installed from this site.
