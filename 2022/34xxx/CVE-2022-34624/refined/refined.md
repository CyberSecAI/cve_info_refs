- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JWT (JSON Web Token) used to download files does not expire after logout or within a reasonable amount of time.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session termination/expiration issue, specifically related to JWTs used for file downloads.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reuse the user's download token to download files even after the user has logged out. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-In-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks, access to web server logs (where tokens might be stored).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a MiTM position or have access to web server logs to obtain the JWT.
