{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient filtering of user-supplied input when creating custom tags, specifically in the `mytag_main.php` and `mytag_js.php` files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE). The application allows the injection of arbitrary code into a template file through a custom tag. Specifically, the backquote character (`) is not filtered, which can execute shell commands when included within `<?php ?>` tags.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user can create a custom tag through the admin panel. This tag can include arbitrary code, which is then executed when the tag is included in a page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have administrative access to the DedeCMS backend to create and manage custom tags."
