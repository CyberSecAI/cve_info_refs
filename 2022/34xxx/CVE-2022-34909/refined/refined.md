Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2022-34909 and CVE-2022-34910:

**CVE-2022-34909**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) Android mobile application.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The application's input fields are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Authentication Bypass: Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism.
    *   Data Retrieval: Attackers can retrieve all data stored in the database, including credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** SQL injection through various input fields of the application.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No special capabilities or specific position is mentioned beyond the ability to interact with the application and inject SQL code.

**CVE-2022-34910**

*   **Root Cause:** Passwords stored in clear text in a local database of the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) Android mobile application.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Clear text Storage: The application stores user passwords without any encryption or hashing.
    *   Local Database Access: An attacker can gain access to this local database either through SQL injection or by accessing the database on a rooted device.
*  **Impact:**
    *   Credential Compromise: Attackers can retrieve user passwords.
    *   Lateral Movement: Compromised passwords can potentially be used to access other systems if users use the same passwords.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   SQL Injection: Exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability to access the local database.
    *   Rooted Device: Direct access to the local database on a rooted Android device.
*  **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *  Requires a rooted device OR the ability to exploit SQL Injection to gain access to the local database.
    *   Must be a local attacker, having direct access to the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Both vulnerabilities affect the same application (A4N), version 1.5.0.
*   Both vulnerabilities were addressed in version 1.5.1 (B221115).
*   The provided content includes a timeline of the vulnerability disclosure process, demonstrating a responsible disclosure approach.
*   The content also provides a CVSS score for each of the CVEs, indicating that CVE-2022-34908 and CVE-2022-34909 are high severity and CVE-2022-34910 is medium severity.
