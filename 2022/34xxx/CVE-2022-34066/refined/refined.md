Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a malicious backdoor introduced through a compromised `request` package. This malicious package was present in versions 0.0.1 to 0.0.12 of the `texercise-cli` project.
*   The vulnerability exists because the project used a malicious `request` package instead of the legitimate `requests` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Supply Chain Vulnerability:** The project was compromised due to a malicious dependency in a third-party package. The malicious `request` package was available on some mirror sites even after being removed from PyPI.
*   **Code Execution Backdoor:** The malicious package enabled arbitrary code execution, effectively creating a backdoor into systems where the vulnerable version of `texercise-cli` was installed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on systems that installed the compromised `texercise-cli` versions.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain full control over the affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Dependency Installation:** The attack vector is through the installation of the vulnerable `texercise-cli` package using `pip` (e.g., `pip install texercise -i http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple --trusted-host pypi.doubanio.com`). The malicious `request` package was included as a dependency.
*   **Mirror Sites:**  Even though the malicious package was removed from the main PyPI repository, it was still available on some mirror sites which allows attackers to use those to install the malicious dependency.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Package Creation:** The attacker needed to create a malicious package named `request` to masquerade as a legitimate package.
*   **Repository Access:** The attacker needed to upload the malicious package to a package repository. In this case, while the package was removed from PyPI it remained available on some mirror sites.
*  **Target unawareness**: The attacker relies on the target being unaware that they are installing a malicious package.

**Additional Information:**

*   The maintainers of `texercise-cli` were advised to delete the vulnerable versions (0.0.1~0.0.12) from PyPI and replace the `request` dependency with `requests`.
*   The issue report includes an image that confirms the malicious package installation when using a specific mirror site and command.
