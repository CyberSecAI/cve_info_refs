The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34602.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `ipqos_lanip_editlist` interface of the H3C magic R200 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `getElement` function, used to split strings within the `ipqos_lanip_editlist` interface, has an insufficient buffer size. The function attempts to split a V6 parameter, which has a maximum size of 64, while the actual buffer allocated for the V6 parameter is only 20. This discrepancy leads to a buffer overflow when the input exceeds the allocated size of 20.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP POST requests to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD=ipqos_lanip_editlist` and an overly long `param` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker must also be able to send HTTP POST requests with a crafted parameter.
