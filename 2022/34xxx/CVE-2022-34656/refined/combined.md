### [Free Version is Rubbish.](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/free-version-is-rubbish/)

Free version shouldn’t even be available. It’s rubbish. Goes against the spirit of WordPress community. Whoever designed this is a mean spirited person that doesn’t deserve to be part of this community. We know you need to make money but not by deceiving us into downloading it only to realize it is utter trash and the workable version is only the paid one. Rubbish. You don’t deserve the WordPress community. Rotten person.
