  "CVE-2022-34809": {
    "description": "RQM Plugin 2.8 and earlier stores a password unencrypted in its global configuration file `net.praqma.jenkins.rqm.RqmBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.",
    "root_cause": "The plugin stores the password in plain text in the global configuration file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Credentials stored in plain text"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view the unencrypted password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the corresponding system or application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Access to the Jenkins controller file system."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the configuration file."
