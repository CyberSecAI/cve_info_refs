# CVE-2022-34266

Public on 2022-06-22
Modified on 2023-01-27

Description

A flaw was found in libtiff-4.0.3-35.amzn2.0.1 as packaged on Amazon Linux 2. When processing a malicious TIFF file, an invalid range may be passed as an argument to the memset() function within TIFFFetchStripThing() in tif\_dirread.c. This will cause TIFFFetchStripThing() to segfault. Actors can use this issue to potentially cause a Denial of Service condition.

| [Description](#c0)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-07-20 01:04:16 UTC  ``` CVE-2022-34266:  The libtiff-4.0.3-35.amzn2.0.1 package for LibTIFF on Amazon Linux 2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash), a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-0562. When processing a malicious TIFF file, an invalid range may be passed as an argument to the memset() function within TIFFFetchStripThing() in tif_dirread.c. This will cause TIFFFetchStripThing() to segfault after use of an uninitialized resource.  Unsure if this only applies to Amazon Linux or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-08-29 17:31:32 UTC  ``` Asked MITRE for more information. The Amazon page for the CVE (<https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2022-34266.html>) has a link to this dead RedHat URL:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-34266> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-01-25 19:07:53 UTC  ``` Asked upstream: <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/516> ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-01-27 18:01:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=859433#c2)) > Asked upstream: <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/516>  "Who knows ? This is totally unactionable by us without a pointer to a patch. This CVE also refers to a super old libtiff version. Presumably something that has been fixed in later upstream releases and Amazon forgot to backport. Closing." ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-04-23 17:40:03 UTC  ``` Andrew Lau reports at the upstream issue that this vulnerability is only accessible by Amazon Linux customers thanks to a bugged backport for another vulnerability. ``` |  |

**Amazon Linux 2 Security Advisory:** ALAS-2022-1814

**Advisory Release Date:** 2022-07-06 03:14 Pacific

**Advisory Updated Date:** 2022-07-14 22:21 Pacific

**Severity:**

Medium

**References:**
[CVE-2022-0562](/cve/html/CVE-2022-0562.html)

**Issue Overview:**

A flaw was found in libtiff where a NULL source pointer passed as an argument to the memcpy() function within the TIFFReadDirectory() in tif\_dirread.c. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit this vulnerability via a crafted TIFF file, causing a crash and leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0562)

A flaw was found in libtiff-4.0.3-35.amzn2.0.1 as packaged on Amazon Linux 2. When processing a malicious TIFF file, an invalid range may be passed as an argument to the memset() function within TIFFFetchStripThing() in tif\_dirread.c. This will cause TIFFFetchStripThing() to segfault. Actors can use this issue to potentially cause a Denial of Service condition. (CVE-2022-34266)

**Affected Packages:**

libtiff

**Note:**

This advisory is applicable to Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) Core repository. Visit this [FAQ section](../../faqs.html#clarify-al2-advisories)
for the difference between AL2 Core and AL2 Extras advisories.

**Issue Correction:**

Run *yum update libtiff* to update your system.

**New Packages:**
```

# CVE-2022-34266: crash within TIFFFetchStripThing

Hi! Does CVE-2022-34266 (<https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2022-34266.html>) affect upstream libtiff? If so, is there a fix? There doesn't seem to be much public information about this vulnerability except what's at the above URL. MITRE isn't sure whether or not it does, and I'm not sure if there's any public contact for these kinds of things at AWS.
