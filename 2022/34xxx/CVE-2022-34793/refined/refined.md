The provided content is a Jenkins Security Advisory that includes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-34793.

**CVE-2022-34793**

*   **Root Cause:** The Recipe Plugin does not properly sanitize or validate XML input, making it vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Missing permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints, allowing unauthenticated access.
    *   Vulnerable XML parsing that does not prevent XXE attacks.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to missing POST request validation.
    *   Exposure of job configuration XML data, including unredacted secrets, to users with Item/Read permissions through the recipe export feature.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers can perform server-side request forgery.
    *   Attackers can extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.
    *   Attackers can gain access to job configuration XML data, including sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL that is parsed as XML by Jenkins. This request does not require specific permissions.
    *   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to make unauthorized requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission checks and XXE vulnerability.
    *   An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious XML file to exploit the XXE vulnerability.
    *   No specific user interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

The advisory also mentions that there is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
