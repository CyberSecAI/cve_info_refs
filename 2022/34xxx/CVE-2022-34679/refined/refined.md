Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-34679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux, specifically within a kernel mode layer handler.
- The issue is caused by an unhandled return value. When a function returns a value that is not checked, it can lead to subsequent operations using potentially invalid data or memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null-pointer dereference:** The unhandled return value can lead to a null pointer dereference. This occurs when the program attempts to access memory through a pointer that is set to NULL (which points to no valid memory location).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** A successful exploit of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition due to the null pointer dereference. This can crash the system or prevent it from functioning properly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. This means an attacker would need to have some level of access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged regular user:** An unprivileged user on the system is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No user interaction:** The exploitation does not require any user interaction.

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-34679 describes a vulnerability in the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux where a lack of error handling on a function return value can lead to a null-pointer dereference, causing a denial-of-service. This can be triggered by any unprivileged user on the affected system.
