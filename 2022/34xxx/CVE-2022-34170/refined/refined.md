Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-34170:

**CVE-2022-34170** is associated with **SECURITY-2779** in the Jenkins Security Advisory 2022-06-22.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that help icon tooltips in Jenkins no longer escape the feature name. This effectively undid a previous fix implemented for SECURITY-1955.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the feature name in help icon tooltips is not properly escaped, allowing injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript into the Jenkins UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the Jenkins UI. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
*   Session hijacking
*   Credential theft
*   Defacement of the Jenkins interface
*   Redirection to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the help icon tooltips. An attacker needs to inject malicious code within the feature name that will be displayed in the tooltip.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker requires the `Job/Configure` permission to be able to exploit this vulnerability by modifying job configurations to include the malicious feature name.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was introduced in Jenkins 2.320 and LTS 2.332.1 and was resolved in Jenkins 2.356, LTS 2.332.4 and LTS 2.346.1 by escaping the feature name in help icon tooltips.
*   The advisory also notes that this is a regression, effectively undoing a fix for SECURITY-1955.
