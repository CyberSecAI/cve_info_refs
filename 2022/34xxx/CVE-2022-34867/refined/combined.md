# Risks

CVSS 7.3

This vulnerability is highly dangerous and expected to become mass exploited.

##### 7.3

### Sensitive Data Exposure

This could allow a malicious actor to view sensitive information that is normally not available to regular users. This can be used to exploit other weaknesses in the system.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

We advise to mitigate or resolve the vulnerability immediately.

![Protect your website(s)](https://patchstack.com/database/img/shield-star.svg)
### Automatically mitigate vulnerabilities and keep your websites safe

Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate this issue by blocking any attacks until
you have updated to a fixed version.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
