Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `adm.cgi` script of the WAVLINK WN535 G3 device firmware. Specifically, the script directly concatenates the content of a POST request to a system function call, resulting in arbitrary command execution.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw due to unsanitized user input. The POST request's content is taken directly and used as part of the system command.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `adm.cgi` script does not sanitize or validate the POST request data before passing it to a system function.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the device.
    *   **Full System Compromise:** This could lead to complete control of the affected device, allowing the attacker to modify settings, install malware, or use the device as a bot in a botnet.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `adm.cgi` endpoint.
    *   **Network-Based:** The attack can be initiated from any network where the vulnerable device is reachable.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *  **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device on the network.
    *  **Active Session:** An active session on the device is required for successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content provides PoC details with screenshots.
* The vulnerable firmware version is identified: M35G3R.V5030.180927.
