  ],
  "summary": "The vulnerability stems from improper validation of object allocation boundaries during JavaScript execution within Foxit PDF Reader. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read, potentially allowing an attacker to disclose information or, in combination with other vulnerabilities, execute arbitrary code.  The attack vector requires user interaction to either open a specially crafted PDF file or visit a malicious webpage."
