{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of file paths within a ZIP archive during extraction, allowing for directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
      "Zip Slip vulnerability",
      "Arbitrary file write vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system where the vulnerable code is used. This can lead to remote command execution if executable files or configuration files are overwritten with malicious content.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by extracting a specially crafted ZIP archive containing filenames with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../evil.exe`).",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted zip file to the vulnerable application"
  },
    "additional_information": {
    "fix": "The vulnerable `unzip` method was removed in commit `359603b63fc6c59d8b57e061c171954bab3433bf` from the code. The fix was included in version `0.0.2`.",
        "poc": "A proof-of-concept is available that shows how to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious ZIP archive which overwrites the `authorized_keys` file in the `/root/.ssh/` directory. The provided Java code demonstrates how to invoke the vulnerable `unzip` function."
