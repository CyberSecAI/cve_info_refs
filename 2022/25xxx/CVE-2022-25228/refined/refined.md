- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible via the web interface through several parameters: `userID`, `candidateID`, `jobOrderID`, and `companyID` in the specified endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to read job orders, candidates or companies to exploit the vulnerability.
