Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The application, Proton v0.2.0, renders content from a markdown file which allows an attacker to embed a malicious link. When clicked by the victim, the application loads the attacker-controlled page within the application's context. This, combined with the enabled `nodeIntegration` feature, allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate URLs within the markdown files, allowing for the injection of a malicious link.
    *   **Node.js Integration Enabled:** The `nodeIntegration` setting being enabled in the Electron application allows the loaded webpage to use Node.js features, which can be abused to execute OS commands.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): By injecting JavaScript code into the opened malicious page, an attacker can use Node.js functions such as `child_process.exec` to execute arbitrary system commands on the victim's machine, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Markdown File:** The attacker creates a markdown file containing a malicious link.
    *   **External Server:**  The attacker hosts the malicious content (`rce.html` in the example) on a server they control.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to create and distribute a crafted markdown file to the victim.
    *   Ability to host the malicious `rce.html` file on a server accessible by the victim.
    *   The victim must be running the vulnerable application and click the malicious link inside the application.
