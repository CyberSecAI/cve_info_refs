- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `joyqi/hyper-down` package's markdown parser does not adequately filter the `href` attribute, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the markdown parser, specifically the handling of the `href` attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of the user's browser when they interact with the crafted link. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, exposure of sensitive information, access to privileged services, and malware delivery.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a markdown link with a malicious javascript URI (e.g., `[text](javascript:malicious_code)`), an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript when a user interacts with the link generated by the vulnerable markdown parser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious markdown into the application where it will be processed by `joyqi/hyper-down`, and a user needs to click the malicious link. This does not require any prior access to the system.
