The one-year subscription is included by default in the Standard and Advanced license. Once the initial period has expired, subscriptions should be purchased separately.

What happens if the subscription is not renewed?

An active subscription will allow you to install compatibility updates that are necessary to keep your Passwork compatible with new versions of OS, browsers, mobile apps, extensions, and other systems (PHP, OpenSSL, MongoDB).

Please note that this complimentary one-year subscription for updates and technical support is a one-time offer for a single legal entity and will not be available for any subsequent purchases.
