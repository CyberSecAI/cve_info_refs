Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `saveParentControlInfo` function within the Tenda AX1806 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Overflow:** The `saveParentControlInfo` function takes a parameter `deviceName` directly from the HTTP request. This `deviceName` is then passed to `setdevicename`. The `setdevicename` function copies the content of the `deviceName` parameter into a stack buffer using `sprintf` without proper size validation.  This allows an attacker to overwrite the stack by supplying an overly long `deviceName`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overflowing the stack buffer, the attacker can crash the router's process, leading to a denial of service. The router may become unresponsive or reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint. The `deviceName` parameter in this POST request is used to cause the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This likely means being on the same local network as the router or having access to it through a port forwarding or other network configuration.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL (`/goform/saveParentControlInfo`) and the vulnerable parameter (`deviceName`).
- **Ability to craft a malicious request:** The attacker needs to be able to create a HTTP POST request with a long `deviceName` parameter that overflows the buffer.

**Additional Details:**

- The content provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) HTTP request demonstrating the exploitation.
- The vulnerable function is located at the path `goform/saveParentControlInfo`.
- The vulnerability affects Tenda Router AX1806 version v1.0.0.1.
