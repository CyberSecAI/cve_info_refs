# Advisory: BlogEngine .Net - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion (CVE-2022-25591)

---

### **Summary**

An unauthenticated arbitrary file deletion vulnerability was discovered in BlogEngine .NET. By performing a directory traversal attack out of the intended folder structure, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could delete critical files required by the application.

### **Impact**

By crafting a specific HTTP request, an unauthenticated attacker has the ability to delete critical files located within the webserver root directory, affecting the overall availability of the service. This is dependent on the permission level in which the application is being run. Should the application be running with Full Control or Modify permissions within the web root, an attacker may cause a Denial of Service state. This permission level is default within the BlogEngine .NET application.

### **Affected Software Version**

The vulnerability was confirmed on version 3.3.8.0, however it is likely that previous versions are affected.

### **Product Description**

BlogEngine .NET is a light-weight, open source blogging platform built upon Microsoft's .NET framework.

### **Remediation**

The pull request submitted can be found [here](https://github.com/BlogEngine/BlogEngine.NET/pull/247?ref=0xlanks.me). The suggested fixes have been tested and correctly remediate the issue.
