This GitHub repository contains proof-of-concept scripts for multiple vulnerabilities in CentOS Web Panel. It includes details on pre-auth RCE, account takeover, internal API access, and post-auth RCE.  While the specific CVE-2022-25047 isn't directly mentioned, the described vulnerabilities align with the type of issues a CVE would cover.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerabilities described:

**1. Pre-Auth RCE (Remote Code Execution)**
   - **Root cause:** Chaining a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability with a command injection vulnerability.
   - **Weakness:** LFI allows access to arbitrary files on the server. Command injection in a vulnerable parameter allows execution of system commands.
   - **Impact:**  Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code as root.
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request.
   - **Required Capabilities:**  Network access to the vulnerable CentOS Web Panel instance.

**2. Account Takeover**
    - **Root cause:** Predictable reset token generation in the password reset process.
    - **Weakness:** The reset token is not cryptographically secure, making it predictable if username and email are known.
    - **Impact:** Attackers can reset passwords for any user (excluding root), gaining control of their accounts.
    - **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted reset request
    - **Required Capabilities:** Knowledge of the target user's username and email address

**3. Internal API Access**
    - **Root cause:**  The internal API is not protected and can be accessed by any authenticated user.
    - **Weakness:** Lack of access control on the internal API.
    - **Impact:**  Exposes functions for listing, modifying, and creating accounts.
    - **Attack Vector:** Uploading and accessing a malicious file (e.g., `internal_api.php`) via file manager
    - **Required Capabilities:** A valid user account with file management privileges.

**4. Post-Auth RCE (User Login)**
    - **Root cause:** Command injection vulnerability in the `userlang` parameter during login.
    - **Weakness:** Input is not sanitized properly before being used in system commands.
    - **Impact:** Attacker can execute commands as root.
    - **Attack Vector:** Sending a malicious `userlang` parameter during login
    - **Required Capabilities:** Valid username and password for an existing account.

**5. Post-Auth RCE (User Modules)**
    - **Root cause:** Command injection vulnerabilities in various user module POST parameters.
    - **Weakness:** Multiple modules are vulnerable to command injection.
    - **Impact:** Users can execute arbitrary code as root.
    - **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerable parameters in specific modules.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Valid username and password for an existing account.

   - **Vulnerable Modules include**:
        - DNS zone editor (`namereg` parameter)
        - MySQL manager (database optimize: `db` parameter)
        - Disk usage (`folder_name` parameter)
        - SSL certificate info (`domain` parameter)
        - Error log viewer (`textsearch` parameter)
