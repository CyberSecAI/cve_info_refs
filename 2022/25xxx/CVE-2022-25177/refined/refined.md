The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25177.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries plugin follows symbolic links to locations outside of the expected Pipeline library when reading files using the `libraryResource` step, and it does not restrict the names of resources passed to the `libraryResource` step.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file read vulnerability due to following symbolic links outside the intended directory.
- Path traversal vulnerability due to not restricting resource names passed to the libraryResource step.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker able to configure Pipelines can read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

**Attack vectors:**
- By configuring a Pipeline to use a crafted SCM repository containing symbolic links to files outside of the intended directory.
- By configuring a Pipeline to use crafted resource names in the `libraryResource` step to access arbitrary files

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the "Item/Configure" permission to configure Pipelines.
