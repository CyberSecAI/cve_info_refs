The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MaxSite CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization/validation of the `f_file_description` parameter when updating a file in the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the `f_file_description` parameter and is stored in the database. This code is executed when the affected page is rendered, targeting web admins.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The injected JavaScript payload is executed when an administrator views the affected page. This allows an attacker to perform actions in the context of the admin user, such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `/admin/files` page where the vulnerable parameter `f_file_description` is located.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as a web admin to access the admin panel and modify file descriptions.
