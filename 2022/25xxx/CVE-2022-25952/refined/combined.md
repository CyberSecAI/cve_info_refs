## FAQ

### What if my advertiser is not yet supported?

If your advertiser isn’t listed among our supported modules, we offer several flexible solutions:

* **Feed Modules**: Work with any CSV or XML product feeds.
* **Offer Module**: Manually add any products.
* **Affiliate Egg Integration**: Use custom Affiliate Egg parsers for additional support.

For more information, read: [My network isn’t listed](https://ce-docs.keywordrush.com/modules/my-network-isnt-listed).

### How many individual Feed modules can I create?

* **Free Version**: Create up to 3 separate feed modules.
* **Pro Version**: Create up to 50 separate feed modules.

Additionally, you can use merged feeds for multiple merchants, as many affiliate networks provide this option.

### Is Amazon supported?

Amazon is supported in the Pro version with two available modules:

* **Amazon via Official PA API**: Integrate directly with Amazon’s Product Advertising API.
* **NoAPI Module**: Designed for beginners, this module allows you to make your first 3 sales and gain API access.

### Can I create custom output templates?

Yes, you can create custom templates. Here are two ways to do it:

1. **Manual Customization**: You’ll need skills in PHP, HTML, and CSS. The default templates use the Bootstrap CSS framework.
2. **AI Assistance**: Use a specially trained ChatGPT to create a custom template. Simply describe what you need, and the AI will generate the code for you instantly.

### What’s the difference between Content Egg and Affiliate Egg?

* **Content Egg**: Operates through official product APIs and offers numerous modules for various affiliate networks. Ideal for product review blogs, price comparison websites, and daily deals websites.
* **Affiliate Egg**: Functions as a web parser, requiring no API access. It allows you to use Affiliate Egg parsers as separate modules within the Content Egg plugin.

the greed of these developers has taken over
with the np api option; what they are doing now is purposely blocking your ip address to amazon and then warning that your ip address is blocked with amazon.they redirect you to a page that has affiliate links on, you have no option now but to use

This plugin is very bad. Not working properly. These plugins cause my server to block every time.So I am not interested to use these plugins. After purchasing these plugins, 4 days later, I want a refund of my $99.But they are not interested to refund my money. Maybe that company is one kind of spam.
Please don’t waste your money on purchasing these plugins.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
