Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of insecure file upload handling and insufficient access controls in CuppaCMS. Specifically, the `/js/jquery_file_upload/server/php/index.php` file allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by first modifying the `allowed_extensions` in `Configuration.php` to include `.php` files. This modification is achieved by sending a crafted POST request to `/classes/ajax/Functions.php`.
*   Subsequently, an attacker can upload a malicious PHP file to the server using `/js/jquery_file_upload/server/php/index.php` by setting the path as "../".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The file upload functionality in `/js/jquery_file_upload/server/php/index.php` does not require authentication, allowing any user to upload files.
*   **Insecure File Extension Handling:** The system does not properly sanitize or validate file extensions. By modifying the configuration an attacker is able to upload .php files.
*   **Path Traversal:**  The upload process does not properly sanitize the `path` parameter, allowing an attacker to use `../` to upload files to arbitrary locations outside the intended upload directory.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The ability to upload and execute PHP files leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable CuppaCMS instance.
*   **Full System Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain control of the server, access sensitive data, install malware, or use the server for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to `/classes/ajax/Functions.php` to modify the allowed extensions, and then to `/js/jquery_file_upload/server/php/index.php` to upload a malicious PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable CuppaCMS instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or user privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability as stated in the title of the issue report "Unauthorized Remote Code Execution vulnerability".

In summary, the vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain Remote Code Execution on the server due to insecure file upload handling and insufficient access control.
