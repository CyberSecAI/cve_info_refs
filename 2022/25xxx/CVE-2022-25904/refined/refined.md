Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25904:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `vm.runInNewContext` function within the `safeEval` function in the `safe-eval` package. This function, intended to provide a safe evaluation environment, allows attackers to modify properties of the `Object.prototype` through prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution, which allows an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`. This is achieved by manipulating the `__proto__` property.
- **Unsafe Use of `vm.runInNewContext`:**  The `vm` module's functionality, when not properly sandboxed, permits direct access to the global scope, allowing modification of the prototype chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to DoS. For instance, if `Object.prototype.toString` is altered, it can break code relying on this function.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates properties, polluting `Object.prototype` can enable RCE, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating specific object attributes.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties that the codebase relies on, potentially gaining unauthorized access or privileges (e.g., setting `isAdmin` to `true` for privilege escalation).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `safeEval` function. By passing malicious code containing `__proto__` property modifications to the function, attackers can pollute the prototype.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input of the `safeEval` function with malicious code.
- No special privileges are required prior to the attack.
- No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Specific Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `index.js` file of the `safe-eval` package, specifically line 24, where `vm.runInNewContext` is used.
- Proof of Concept (PoC) code provided shows how an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype` using `__proto__.test=123`.
- Another PoC demonstrates the use of globalThis to achieve the same result.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using code similar to:
  ```javascript
  var unsafe= require("safe-eval")
  console.log({}.test) //undefined
  unsafe("__proto__.test=123")
  console.log({}.test) //123
  ```
  or
  ```javascript
  var safeEval = require('safe-eval')
  let code = ` (function() {
      let ret = globalThis;
      ret.__proto__.polluted = "ret.__proto__.polluted";
  })() `
  safeEval(code);
  const polluted_result = {}["polluted"];
  console.log(polluted_result); // ret.__proto__.polluted
  ```
**Additional notes:**
- The Snyk analysis provides a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) while NVD gives a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical).
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over a network.
-  There is no fixed version for the `safe-eval` package at the time this information was gathered.
- The report suggests multiple prevention measures, such as freezing the prototype, input schema validation, avoiding unsafe merges, using prototype-less objects, and using `Map` objects.
