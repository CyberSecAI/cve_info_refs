Security

The following security issues are fixed in this release. Thanks to the
Polish Financial Supervision Authority IT Security Department (UKNF)
for reporting these issues.

* RTIR's Whois lookup tool is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF).
It accepts queries in a way that could allow sending requests from the RTIR
server to a resource other than the intended whois server. Because the request
comes from the RTIR server, this could allow access to otherwise protected
resources. This vulnerability is assigned [CVE-2022-25800](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25800).

* RTIR's Scripted Action tools is vulnerable to server-side request forgery
(SSRF) similar to the one described above. This vulnerability is assigned
[CVE-2022-25801](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25801).
