{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of file extensions during profile picture uploads, which allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious PHP code within a profile picture.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is critical, as a malicious user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise and data manipulation. The attacker can also use this vulnerability to create malicious scenarios, depending on the attacker's intentions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Upload a malicious file as a profile picture."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a user account on the system and the ability to upload a profile picture.",
     "details": "The Home Owners Collection Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE). An authenticated user can upload a malicious file, disguising it as a profile picture, which is then executed by the server due to improper sanitization of the file extension. This allows the user to execute arbitrary code on the server."
