    "text": "The provided content relates to CVE-2022-25305, which is a stored XSS vulnerability in the WP Statistics plugin.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and escaping of the `ip` parameter found in the `~/includes/class-wp-statistics-hits.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into the database.\n\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n  - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n  - Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\n\n- **Impact of exploitation:**\n  - Attackers can inject malicious web scripts that will execute when an administrator views the statistics dashboard or other pages displaying the vulnerable data.\n  \n- **Attack vectors:**\n  - Unauthenticated attackers can send a crafted request to the `/wp-json/wp-statistics/v2/hit` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `ip` parameter.\n\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n  - The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have special privileges to inject the malicious payload. They only need to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint. The stored XSS will trigger when an administrator visits pages that display the injected content.",
