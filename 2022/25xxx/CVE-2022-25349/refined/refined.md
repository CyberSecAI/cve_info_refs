- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper escaping of user input in the autocomplete component. User-provided input is parsed as HTML/JavaScript and inserted into the DOM without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically a DOM-based XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious code (HTML/JavaScript) that will be executed in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, exposing sensitive information, enabling access to privileged services, and delivering malware.
- **Attack vectors**: User input provided to the autocomplete component. By including malicious code in the data for the autocomplete functionality, an attacker can trigger the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control the data provided to the autocomplete component, which likely involves interacting with the application to input malicious data. User interaction is required as the vulnerable code is triggered when a user interacts with the autocomplete feature.
