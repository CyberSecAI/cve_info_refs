{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The stb_truetype library does not perform range checking on offsets found within the font file. The function `stbtt__find_table` attempts to read data from a buffer based on these offsets without validating if the read is within the buffer's boundaries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow due to missing bounds checks",
      "Lack of input validation on font file offsets"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a heap-buffer-overflow, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution by providing a crafted font file with malicious offsets.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious font file",
      "Providing a crafted font file to vulnerable code using `stb_truetype`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted font file that triggers the vulnerability when parsed by the `stb_truetype` library. No specific privileges are required, other than the ability to provide a font file."
