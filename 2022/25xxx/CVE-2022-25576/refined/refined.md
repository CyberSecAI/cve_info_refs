The provided content relates to CVE-2022-25576.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of CSRF protection in the `admin/posts/delete/(:num)` route within Anchor CMS v0.12.7. Specifically, there is no check for a valid token or referer in the request handling, which allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application does not validate the origin of the request to delete a post, which enables a malicious party to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
- Lack of CSRF token validation: The application does not use CSRF tokens to verify the authenticity of the request.
- Lack of Referer check: The application does not check the `Referer` header to verify the request origin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick an authenticated admin user into deleting posts without their consent or knowledge, by crafting a malicious HTML page. This can lead to data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that makes a GET request to the vulnerable `admin/posts/delete/(:num)` endpoint.
- The victim, while logged in, visits the malicious page. The browser will then execute the crafted request.
- This request will delete the post specified in the request, without the user's authorization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious HTML page.
- The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user (admin) into visiting the malicious page while they are logged into the target Anchor CMS instance.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the post ID that they want to delete.
