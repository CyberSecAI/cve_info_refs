Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-25194:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Missing Permission Check

**Root Cause:** The autonomiq Plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint and the endpoint doesn't require POST requests.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Missing permission check:** The plugin's HTTP endpoint lacks a check to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to access it.
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The affected endpoint does not require POST requests, enabling Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

**Impact:**
*   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password, effectively capturing those credentials.
*   An attacker can leverage the CSRF vulnerability to force a victim user to make the malicious request.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network access to the Jenkins instance is required
*   Attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins
*   The attacker crafts a malicious request to the vulnerable HTTP endpoint within the autonomiq plugin.
*   The CSRF attack is possible if an authenticated user is tricked into accessing the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the Jenkins controller, only the ability to craft and send HTTP requests, potentially via a victim user's browser session.

**Affected Plugin:** autonomiq Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 1.15 and earlier

**Fixed Version:** 1.16, requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoint.
