Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-25969:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). Specifically, the WPS Office installer (`wps.exe` or `wps.4.136.exe`) is susceptible to loading malicious DLLs from the same directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The application doesn't properly validate the source of DLL files it loads, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking/planting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL file (named `shcore.dll`) in the same directory as the WPS Office installer and trick a user into launching the installer which would then load and execute the malicious code within the DLL. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System:** The attack vector is local, where the attacker needs to place the malicious DLL file in the same directory as the vulnerable application’s executable. This could be a user's Downloads folder or any other writable location the user might use to store the installation files.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the user to execute the vulnerable installer after the malicious DLL has been placed within the same directory. This can be achieved by socially engineering the user to download the malicious DLL alongside the installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in a directory where the user is likely to store the vulnerable WPS Office installer before the user executes it. This could include tricking the user into downloading the malicious DLL and storing it in the same directory as the installer.
*   The attacker also requires the user to execute the vulnerable installer application.

**Summary of the provided information:**

The provided documents indicate that CVE-2022-25969 is related to an insecure DLL loading vulnerability within the WPS Office installer. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL (specifically `shcore.dll`) in the same folder as the installer. When the user runs the installer, the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed, leading to arbitrary code execution with the user’s privileges. This is a local attack, requiring the attacker to have write access to the directory where the user executes the installer.
