Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-25178:

**CVE-2022-25178 is associated with SECURITY-2613, which also includes CVE-2022-25176, CVE-2022-25177, and CVE-2022-25179.**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries` plugin not restricting the names of resources passed to the `libraryResource` step. This allows for arbitrary file reads. Additionally, the plugin follows symbolic links to locations outside of the expected Pipeline library, also during the `libraryResource` step.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin does not restrict the names of resources passed to the `libraryResource` step, allowing access to resources outside of the intended library location.
*   **Symbolic Link Following:** The plugin follows symbolic links to locations outside of the expected library directory when using the `libraryResource` step.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with the ability to configure Pipelines can read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller's file system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker can craft a pipeline that utilizes the `libraryResource` step with a resource name that points to a location outside of the library, or uses a symbolic link to point to an arbitrary file.
*   The attacker needs to have "Item/Configure" permission for the relevant pipeline.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have "Item/Configure" permission for the Jenkins pipeline.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a pipeline to include a malicious `libraryResource` call.

**Affected Plugin:**
*   `Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries` plugin, versions 552.vd9cc05b8a2e1 and earlier.

**Fixed Plugin Version:**
*   `Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries` plugin, version 561.va\_ce0de3c2d69

**Additional Notes**
This vulnerability is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities in Pipeline-related plugins (SECURITY-2613) that involve arbitrary file reads through symbolic links or unrestricted path names, impacting the `Pipeline: Groovy Plugin`, `Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries`, and `Pipeline: Multibranch` plugins.
