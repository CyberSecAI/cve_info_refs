# XSS vulnerability in tracking pixel functionality

High

[escopecz](/escopecz)
published
GHSA-pjpc-87mp-4332
May 23, 2022

## Package

composer

mautic/core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<4.3.0

## Patched versions

4.3.0

## Description

### Impact

Mautic allows you to track open rates by using tracking pixels.

The tracking information is stored together with extra metadata of the tracking request.

The output isn't sufficiently filtered when showing the metadata of the tracking information, which may lead to a vulnerable situation.

### Patches

Please upgrade to 4.3.0

### Workarounds

None.

### References

* Internally tracked under MST-38

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
