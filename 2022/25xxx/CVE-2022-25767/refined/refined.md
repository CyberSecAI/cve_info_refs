- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The application deserializes data from a malicious database server without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Remote Code Execution due to insecure deserialization (CWE-502) and the ability to connect to a malicious database server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary file read and deserialization of local gadgets, leading to total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by connecting to a malicious database server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any prior access or privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerable component is remotely exploitable.
