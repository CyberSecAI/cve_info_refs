Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `formSetProvince` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to copy data from the `ProcinceCode` HTTP request parameter into a stack buffer without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries if the provided `ProvinceCode` is too large.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending an HTTP POST request with a large `ProvinceCode` parameter to the `/goform/SetProvinceCode` endpoint, an attacker can trigger the stack overflow, leading to a crash of the device and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetProvinceCode` endpoint.
- **`ProvinceCode` Parameter:**  The oversized string is supplied via the `ProvinceCode` parameter in the HTTP POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Tenda router. This typically implies being on the same network or having access through a compromised network.
- **No Authentication Required:** Based on the provided information, it doesn't appear that any authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function directly uses the `ProcinceCode` parameter without validation or sanitization.
- The provided POC demonstrates how an attacker can trigger the vulnerability with a long string.
- The vulnerability affects the Tenda Router AX1806 version 1.0.0.1.
