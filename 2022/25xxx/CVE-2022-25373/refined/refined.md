Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25373:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

   - The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE-2022-25373: ManageEngine Support Center Plus Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)" which confirms it is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the description field of a new request within ManageEngine Support Center Plus. This allows a low-privileged user to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
     - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the stored XSS vulnerability. This occurs when a malicious script is injected and stored on the server (in this case, within the request's description) and is later executed in the browser of other users.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can execute JavaScript within the browser of a higher-privileged user, potentially gaining elevated access or control over the application.
     - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript can be used to perform actions within the application on behalf of the victim user, including exfiltrating data or modifying settings
     - **Other malicious payloads**: More dangerous payloads could be executed in this context.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects the malicious script through the description field of a new support request.
     - **Trigger:** The XSS payload is triggered when another user views the edit history of the infected request.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - **Low-Privileged User:** The attacker only needs to be a low-privileged user, such as a default guest user.
     - **Access to Support Center Plus:** The attacker needs access to the ManageEngine Support Center Plus application to submit requests.

**3. Technical Details**

   - The proof of concept (POC) used the following payload:  `"><img src=x onerror="alert(document.cookie)"/>` within the description field of a new request.
   - The vulnerability was discovered on Manage Engine Support Center 11.0 Build 11019.
