Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-25494:

**CVE-2022-25494**: This CVE ID is not mentioned in the provided content. However, the content describes a SQL injection vulnerability. It is possible that this content is related to CVE-2022-25494 if that CVE describes a SQL injection in the same code.

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `staff_login.php` script. The script directly incorporates user-provided data from the `uname` and `pwd` POST parameters into the SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
*   **SQL Injection**: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the `uname` and `pwd` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation**:
*   **Database compromise**: A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, including staff emails and passwords.
*   **Data manipulation**: The attacker could potentially modify or delete data from the database.
*   **Privilege escalation**: By gaining access to staff accounts, an attacker could escalate privileges within the system.

**Attack vectors**:
*   **HTTP POST request**: The attack is initiated through an HTTP POST request to `staff_login.php`.
*   **Malicious SQL payload**: The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `uname` parameter (and potentially `pwd`), such as `' or '1'='1` or similar SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
*   **Network access**: The attacker must have network access to the web application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint**: The attacker needs to know the location of the `staff_login.php` endpoint.
*   **Ability to intercept/modify requests**: The attacker can use tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
*   **SQL injection expertise**: The attacker requires knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft appropriate payloads.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**

*   **Vulnerable code snippet**: The relevant code from `staff_login.php` is:
    ```php
    $username=$_REQUEST['uname'];
    $password=$_REQUEST['pwd'];
    $sql="SELECT email,pwd FROM staff WHERE email='$username' AND pwd='$password'";
    ```
*   **PoC**:
    1.  Send a POST request to `staff_login.php`.
    2.  Capture the request with Burp.
    3.  Modify the `uname` parameter to include SQL injection payload.
    4.  Use `sqlmap` to automate the exploitation `python sqlmap.py -r data.txt --batch --current-user`.
