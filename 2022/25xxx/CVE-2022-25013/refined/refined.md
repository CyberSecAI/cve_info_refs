```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input from the 'key' and 'fm' GET parameters in login.php before reflecting it in the DOM within a JavaScript context.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the victim's browser. Specifically, a keylogger could be injected to capture the victim's login credentials, leading to password compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "By crafting malicious URLs containing unsanitized JavaScript in the 'key' or 'fm' parameters",
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure a victim into clicking the crafted link, typically via phishing or other social engineering means. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the server side."
