Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a stack buffer overflow in the `formSetSysToolDDNS` function within the `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` page of the Tenda AX1806 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsafe String Copy:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `ddnsDomain` parameter (received from an HTTP request) into a stack-allocated buffer (`v18`) without any bounds checking. This allows for a buffer overflow if the provided `ddnsDomain` string is larger than the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a long `ddnsDomain` parameter, an attacker can cause a stack overflow, leading to a crash and denial of service on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` endpoint. The `ddnsDomain` parameter within this request is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically means being on the same local network as the router or having remote access to it.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) HTTP request that demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability and cause a denial of service.
* The specific vulnerable version is Tenda Router AX1806 v1.0.0.1.
