{
  "CVE-2022-25235": {
    "Description": "xmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 lacks certain validation of encoding, such as checks for whether a UTF-8 character is valid in a certain context.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of UTF-8 encoding within the xmltok_impl.c file in Expat before version 2.4.5. Specifically, the code does not check if a UTF-8 character is valid in a given context.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (CWE-116)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Passing malformed 2- and 3-byte UTF-8 sequences to an XML processing application on top of Expat can lead to arbitrary code execution, depending on how the application handles the invalid UTF-8. Exploits with code execution are known to exist.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by passing malformed UTF-8 sequences (e.g., from start tag names) to Expat."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed XML document with invalid UTF-8 sequences that will be parsed by an application using a vulnerable version of Expat."
    ],
    "Additional Information": "This issue is related to other vulnerabilities in Expat, including CVE-2022-25236, CVE-2022-25313, CVE-2022-25314, and CVE-2022-25315, which were all addressed in Expat 2.4.5. The vulnerability is caused by the library's failure to validate the encoding of UTF-8 characters, which can lead to arbitrary code execution in applications that process the malformed data."
