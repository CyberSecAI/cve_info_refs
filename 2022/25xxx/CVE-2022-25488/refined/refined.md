Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `admin/ajax/avatar.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without any filtering or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the unsanitized input being directly incorporated into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, leading to:
  - Data exfiltration: Access and extraction of sensitive information from the database.
  - Data modification: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
  - Potential compromise of the website: The attacker could potentially compromise the entire website for malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `admin/ajax/avatar.php` file by manipulating the `id` parameter.
- An attacker can inject SQL code within the `id` parameter via a GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which is accessible through the application. No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned, implying that the attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) in the issue description illustrates this SQL injection, which uses `id=-1 union select user()%23`. This PoC demonstrates how the `user()` function output can be retrieved, confirming the successful injection.
- The issue report suggests that this vulnerability is a common problem in the Atom.CMS series and is present in other parts of the code as well.
- A suggestion to use PDO or user input filtering was proposed to fix the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was later fixed in the "AtomCMS-2.1" branch
