- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `collected_by` parameter within the Home Owners Collection Management System.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application which can lead to stealing cookies and potentially full account takeover.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker needs to login to the admin panel.
    - Navigate to the list of collections and click the edit button for a collection.
    - The malicious payload is injected in the `collected_by` parameter during the edit process.
    - The injected script will execute when the modified collection is viewed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires an account with administrator privileges to access the admin panel and modify collection details.
