[CVE-2022-25839  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25839) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-20  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `url-js` to version 2.1.0 or higher.

## Overview

[url-js](https://www.npmjs.org/package/url-js) is a Simple URL parser, similar to DOM URL

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to improper parsing, which makes it is possible for the hostname to be spoofed.
`http://\\\\\\\\localhost` and `http://localhost` are the same URL. However, the hostname is not parsed as localhost, and the backslash is reflected as it is.

## PoC:

Running the following command:

```
node -e "const URLJS = require('url-js');console.log(URLJS('http://\\\\localhost'))"

```

Will result in the following output:

```
URLJS {
  protocol: 'http:',
  username: '',
  password: '',
  hostname: '\\localhost',
  port: '',
  pathname: '/',
  search: '',
  query: '',
  hash: ''
}

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

4.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
