Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the logging of REST/SOAP API calls, specifically the login API, including the user's password, in a PostgreSQL database table. This logging occurred in versions prior to CMDBuild 3.3.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Plaintext Password Logging:**  The primary weakness is that the user's password was stored in plaintext within the database logs, which are intended for debugging.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Filtering:** The application failed to exclude the password parameter from being logged.
- **Insecure logging practices:** Logging sensitive data such as passwords can lead to their exposure if logs are not protected adequately.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials Exposure:** A malicious actor with access to the PostgreSQL database logs could obtain user passwords.
- **Unauthorized System Access:** With compromised credentials, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Data Breach:** If the system holds sensitive data, the attackers might use the credentials to perform data exfiltration.
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** User credentials and potentially other data can be exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Database Access:** An attacker could gain access to the PostgreSQL database server through command-line SQL queries or a client program.
- **Compromise of Database Server:** If the database server is compromised, the stored passwords in logs could be accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database Access:** The attacker would need to be in a position to access the PostgreSQL database, which may include:
   - A database administrator account.
   - A compromised account with SQL query access or ability to connect to the database.
   - Direct access to the database server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in CMDBuild versions 3.0 and later prior to the patch in 3.3.3.
- The vulnerability does not occur when using SSO (Single Sign-On) because the password is not entered on a CMDBuild form.
- The logging mechanism includes a "rotate" feature which presumably overwrites old log data after a certain point.
- A patch was applied for users with an active subscription before the public disclosure, and all other users were urged to upgrade to version 3.3.3 to resolve this issue.
- The password was logged as a parameter in the API call logs, and the system administrator could modify the default log level.
