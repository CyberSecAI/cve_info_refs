Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The tokenization key configuration endpoint in Vault Enterprise incorrectly included the base64-encoded tokenization key as part of the requested key configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability lies in the exposure of the tokenization key through the configuration endpoint. This key is meant to be a secret, not exposed through an API intended for configuration retrieval.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Tokenization Reversal:** If an attacker gains access to the tokenization key and the tokenization state, they can reverse the tokenization process, revealing the original sensitive values protected by the tokenization transform. This would lead to a confidentiality breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker would need to access the Vault Enterprise API.
- **API Access:** Exploitation requires the attacker to have `read` permissions on the tokenization key configuration endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authorized Vault operator with the specific permission to read the tokenization key configuration endpoint.
- **Knowledge of Vault Internal State**: An attacker would also need tokenization state values (stored either in Vaultâ€™s backend storage or external RDBMS) as well as end-user-device tokens (if the default, non-exportable tokenization mode is used) to reverse the tokenization process.

**Additional Information:**

- This issue is specific to Vault Enterprise.
- The vulnerability was identified by the Vault engineering team during ongoing development.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Vault Enterprise versions 1.7.10, 1.8.9, and 1.9.4.
- Rotating the tokenization key is recommended if exposure is suspected.
