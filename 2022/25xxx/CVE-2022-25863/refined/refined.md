Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25863:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `gatsby-plugin-mdx` plugin, by default, supported a "JS engine" for frontmatter processing. This allowed execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the frontmatter of MDX files.
*   The vulnerability stems from passing input to the `gray-matter` package without proper sanitization of the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The plugin deserializes untrusted data provided in the frontmatter.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the frontmatter can lead to RCE on the build server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the build server where the Gatsby site is being built. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server.
*   **Confidentiality Loss:**  An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored on the server.
*   **Integrity Loss:** An attacker can modify any files or resources on the server.
*   **Availability Loss**: Depending on the actions taken by the attacker, they could also cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **MDX Files:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the frontmatter of MDX files. These could be located in the `src/pages` directory or in other locations where MDX files are processed.
*   **GraphQL Queries:** The vulnerability can be exploited when querying MDX nodes via GraphQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content into the frontmatter of MDX files, or influence the data being processed by the plugin. This could be achieved by:
    *   Compromising the source of the content (if the MDX content is sourced from a third party).
    *   If the markdown is user-provided, then the attacker would need the ability to modify this content.
    *   Compromising a user account with write access to the project's files.
*   **Build Server Access:** While not directly needed for exploitation, successful exploitation leads to code execution on the build server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable syntax uses `---js` or `---javascript` to denote JavaScript frontmatter.
*   The provided PoC shows how malicious JavaScript can be injected and executed via the frontmatter:
    ```javascript
    var payload = '---jsn((require("child_process")).execSync("touch rce"))';
    ```
    This payload, if processed, would attempt to create a file named 'rce' on the server.
*   The fix involves disabling the JS frontmatter engine by default and providing an option to re-enable it.
*   The fix also includes a warning if JS frontmatter is present and the engine is disabled.
*   The patch disables the parsing of the JS frontmatter by default using the `JSFrontmatterEngine` option
*   The fix was implemented in commit `f214eb0694c61e348b2751cecd1aace2046bc46e`

**Versions Affected:**

*   `gatsby-plugin-mdx` versions before 2.14.1, versions 3.0.0 to before 3.15.2 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to version 2.14.1 or 3.15.2 or higher.
*   If an older version must be used, sanitize input passed to the plugin before processing.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Feng Xiao and Zhongfu Su.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-25863.
*   The Snyk vulnerability database includes a proof-of-concept for the vulnerability.
*   The EPSS score is 0.4% (74th percentile), indicating a relatively low probability of widespread exploitation in the wild.
