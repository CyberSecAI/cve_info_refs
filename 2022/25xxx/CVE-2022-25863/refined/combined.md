### @pieh **[pieh](/pieh)** commented [Jun 2, 2022](#issue-1258482155) • edited Loading

## Description

Currently `gatsby-plugin-mdx` by default supports the "JS engine" for frontmatter. The example syntax for it is:

```
---js
{
  foo: require(`fs`).readFileSync('something', 'utf-8')
}
---

Your regular MDX body

```

This was never intended default behavior because in some cases it can open up an attack vector for remote code execution (on the build server). As long as sourced content is secure and actually owned by same party as site owner, this doesn't cause problems, but we should be explicit with this, so we disable it by default with option to re-enable it (if someone actually relied on this unintended "feature")

In new default mode ( JS frontmatter engine disabled), we will show warning if there is any content that use JS frontmatter that this will not be processed/executed:

[![Screenshot 2022-06-02 at 18 55 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/419821/171688283-c5f8e876-1e4f-449b-a303-a8e50e9ed7e3.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/419821/171688283-c5f8e876-1e4f-449b-a303-a8e50e9ed7e3.png)

Because this is security risk we will continously show warning as reminder that it might not be safe to use it (it's not guaranteed it's not safe - context matter a lot):

### Documentation

Small stub added to README.md about new plugin option referencing not yet published advisory with some details - this could likely be made nicer, but for the sake if getting fix out, this will have to do for now.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks [@mosesoak](https://github.com/mosesoak)! It was not an oversight, but we were waiting on GitHub to assign a CVE to the issue before publishing the advisory. But, it doesn't appear that this will happen today so I went ahead and published the advisory. The link should work for you now. |

| **Edit:** this only works for `gatsby develop`, see below for a solution for `gatsby build`  It seems like commenting out line 187 with `options` prevents this from happening:     [gatsby/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/loaders/mdx-loader.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/7dfd52d9b43e9fe2e456b273dc75de99634ace5d/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/loaders/mdx-loader.js#L180-L196)  Lines 180 to 196 in [7dfd52d](/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/7dfd52d9b43e9fe2e456b273dc75de99634ace5d)   |  | let code = content | | --- | --- | |  | // after running mdx, the code \*always\* has a default export, so this | |  | // check needs to happen first. | |  | if (!hasDefaultExport(content, options) && !!defaultLayout) { | |  | debug(`inserting default layout`, defaultLayout) | |  | const { content: contentWithoutFrontmatter, matter } = grayMatter( | |  | content, | |  | options | |  | ) | |  |  | |  | code = `${matter ? matter : ``} | |  |  | |  | import DefaultLayout from "${slash(defaultLayout)}" | |  |  | |  | export default DefaultLayout | |  |  | |  | ${contentWithoutFrontmatter}` |      Also, it seems like the options being passed to `gray-matter` on this line don't match the valid `gray-matter` options at all... They are Gatsby config options.   ---   **Edit:** Apparently commenting out the above line only works in `gatsby develop`.  A solution for `gatsby build` (SSG) requires:   1. Commenting out passing all options to `gray-matter` in the `mdx-loader.js`, `utils/mdx.js`, `utils/gen-mdx.js` files (using `patch-package`) 2. And then ALSO enabling the `JSFrontmatterEngine` option   Super strange, wonder what's causing this Frontmatter to show up in the content.   ---   [@pieh](https://github.com/pieh) have any idea what's happening here? Or do you think that I should open a new issue? |

### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

[CVE-2022-25863  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25863) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-502  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to version 2.14.1, 3.15.2 or higher.

## Overview

[gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gatsby-plugin-mdx) is a MDX integration for Gatsby

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data when passing input through to the `gray-matter` package, due to its default configurations that are missing input sanitization.
Exploiting this vulnerability is possible when passing input in both `webpack` (MDX files in src/pages or MDX file imported as a component in frontend / React code) and data mode (querying MDX nodes via GraphQL).

## Workaround:

If an older version of `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.

## Poc:

```
const mdxToJsx = require("gatsby-plugin-mdx/utils/mdx.js");

var payload = '---jsn((require("child_process")).execSync("touch rce"))';

mdxToJsx(payload);

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
