The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25485.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `alertLightbox.php` file. The `url` parameter, which is received via POST request, is directly included in a PHP include statement without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The application does not sanitize the `url` parameter, which allows an attacker to include local files via directory traversal.
- Lack of input validation: The `sanitizeString` function only performs HTML encoding and trimming, and does not prevent directory traversal sequences such as "../".

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file reading: By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information such as configuration files, database credentials, or system files.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a POST request to `/alerts/alertLightbox.php` with the `url` parameter set to a path including directory traversal sequences such as `../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server.
