### @mpeddada1 **[mpeddada1](/mpeddada1)** commented [Aug 25, 2022](#issue-1351296629) • edited Loading

Currently, in order to verify if the docker path provided (either default or specified by the user) is installed correctly, we actually run the executable. The side effect of this is that any arbitrary executable can be executed by Jib.

This PR avoids the need to run the executable by using Files.isExecutable which verifies if the path provided exists and the JVM has the correct permissions to execute the path. However in the case of verifying whether docker is on PATH, running the `docker` command seems unavoidable at the moment. Reasoning in [#3744 (comment)](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3744#discussion_r955307325)

Verified with `./gradlew jib-gradle-plugin:integrationTest`

Sorry, something went wrong.

Some background of this change: Checking for existence of the default docker command when it is on PATH has been a little tricky. There can be several places where docker could be installed on a system and this also differs from OS to OS. For checking whether the path passed through `jib.dockerClient.executable` is installed correctly, however, we no longer run executable itself.

Sorry, something went wrong.

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 3 Aug 2022

[CVE-2022-25914  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25914) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-94  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `com.google.cloud.tools:jib-core` to version 0.22.0 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the `isDockerInstalled` function, due to attempting to execute input.

## PoC:

```
public static void poc(){
Path path = Paths.get("whoami");
DockerClient.isDockerInstalled(path);
}

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.6 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
