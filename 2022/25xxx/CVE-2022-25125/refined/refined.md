The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25125. It describes a SQL injection vulnerability found in the MCMS (MingSoft Content Management System) project, specifically on the `/mdiy/dict/**listExcludeApp**` route.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `orderBy` parameter of the `/mdiy/dict/**listExcludeApp**` route is vulnerable to stacked SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stacked SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize or properly validate user input within the `orderBy` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject multiple SQL statements.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through a web request to the `/mdiy/dict/**listExcludeApp**` route by manipulating the `orderBy` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable route, which appears to be a front-end vulnerability that does not require prior authentication based on the description provided.
