#### Introduced: 24 Oct 2022

[CVE-2022-25892  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25892) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `hummus` to version 1.0.111 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when supplied with a maliciously crafted PDF file to be parsed.

## PoC

```
var pdfReader = muhammara.createReader(
__dirname + "/TestMaterials/BrokenPdfBadHeader.txt"
);

```js
var pdfReader = hummus.createReader(
__dirname + "/TestMaterials/BrokenPdfBadHeader.txt"
);

```

PDF file contents:

```
%PDF-1.4
%%EOF

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

| I noticed that certain invalid PDFs cause the Node.js process to crash with `SIGSEGV`. I will reach out with examples.  Even though it is an invalid PDF, it should not cause the Node.js process to crash with `SIGSEGV`, which can't be caught; instead, it should throw an `Error`, like it does for other invalid PDFs. |

| PDF Writer is deprecated and I wonder if they will accept a pull request. Also, haven't we already forked PDF Writer here?  A crash like this seems like it should be accompanied by a CVE, since it can cause DOS. |

| Certain invalid PDFs cause the Node.js process to crash with `SIGSEGV`. I can provide an example.  Even though it is an invalid PDF, it should not cause the Node.js process to crash with `SIGSEGV`, which can't be caught; instead, it should throw an `Error`, like it does for other invalid PDFs.  There is a duplicate issue in `muhammara`, a fork of `hummus`: [julianhille/MuhammaraJS#214](https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS/issues/214) |

So should i mention you or create security related tickets here and maybe PRs? Same question for PDF Writer, cause it has been a long time without maintenance so i thought its abandoned / discontinued.  If not it would be awesome to point people to muhammara, at least in case of hummus, "merge" community and keep improving. |

| I'll provide them as long as my interests in using hummus remains. as it happens im using it now and this comes handy. going forward people should use muhammara for guarantee of service. still...there's still quite a lot of people using hummusjs and pdfwriter now. i don't mind if they benefit from this, so i'll publish. |

| Btw my actual plan was to fork, disconnect the fork, and keep maintaining pdf writer, then use it as a submodule for muhammara. That would mean all sides would benefit from updates / improvements and it would be less duplicated PRs / commits / work.  If you would like we could have a chat about it. |

| yeah but then there's those nifty features added that i don't want. so no...muhammara will be the people's wishes, and hummus will fulfil my own. sort of an old school opensource when it was about sharing sources and not endless mundane maintainance. hopefully people will stop using it sometime. though it doesn't seem to be that way still, unfortunately. |

#### Introduced: 24 Oct 2022

[CVE-2022-25892  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25892) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `muhammara` to version 2.6.1, 3.1.1 or higher.

## Overview

[muhammara](https://www.npmjs.org/package/muhammara) is a Create, read and modify PDF files and streams. A drop in replacement for hummusjs PDF library

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when supplied with a maliciously crafted PDF file to be parsed.

## PoC

```
var pdfReader = muhammara.createReader(
__dirname + "/TestMaterials/BrokenPdfBadHeader.txt"
);

```js
var pdfReader = hummus.createReader(
__dirname + "/TestMaterials/BrokenPdfBadHeader.txt"
);

```

PDF file contents:

```
%PDF-1.4
%%EOF

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).
