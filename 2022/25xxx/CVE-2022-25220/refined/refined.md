Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input within markdown descriptions when creating products, reports, or findings in PeTeReport version 0.5. Specifically, the application does not neutralize or encode javascript code injected via a `javascript:` URL scheme in markdown links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database and then executed in the browser of any user who views the affected content.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize user-provided markdown input, allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view a product, report, or finding with the malicious markdown.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information by running malicious javascript.
*   **Account Takeover:** If the targeted user has elevated privileges (e.g., an admin), an attacker might be able to take over the user's account.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker could modify the appearance or functionality of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:** The attack vector is user-supplied input, specifically the markdown description field when adding or editing products, reports, or findings.
*   **Markdown Injection:** The injection occurs through specially crafted markdown links that use a `javascript:` URL scheme.
*   **Persistence:** The malicious payload is stored in the database, making it persistent and affecting other users who view the same content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Admin User:** The attacker must be an authenticated administrator to inject the malicious code into product descriptions or similar fields.
*   **Knowledge of Markdown Syntax:** The attacker needs to be aware of markdown syntax to inject javascript using the `javascript:` URL scheme.
*   **Access to Application Interface:** The attacker must have access to the PeTeReport application's interface to create or edit products/reports.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the Offensive Team of Fluid Attacks.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in PeTeReport version 0.7.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) is: `[XSS](javascript:alert(1))`.
*   The CVSSv3.1 vector for this vulnerability is: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`
