- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple areas, leading to stored XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Injecting JavaScript code into the "third party code" field in system settings.
    - Injecting JavaScript code using the `onerror` attribute of an `img` tag in the video insertion functionality of the content management system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the administrative panel to modify system settings or create content within the CMS.
