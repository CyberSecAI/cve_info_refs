| Will there be a CVE for this issue? [@jpfr](https://github.com/jpfr) Is this also exploitable without a valid, trusted client certificate? I assume systems with less than 512 MB memory will need to further reduce the max. settings or how does this config option affect memory consumption? |

| Yes, systems with less memory need to adjust. But we do already cover malloc returning NULL when the system is out of memory.  I will post the CVE once I receive it. Making the CVE is up to the group that reported the issue. |

[v1.2.5](/open62541/open62541/tree/v1.2.5)

[`b79db1a`](/open62541/open62541/commit/b79db1ac78146fc06b0b8435773d3967de2d659c)

This is the fifth patch release for the 1.2 release family of open62541.

There were only bugfixes and no API-breaking changes applied for the patch release.

Changes compared to the previous release include:

* fix(client): Replace the nonce with the ActivateSessionResponse
* fix(plugin): Add default limits for chunks and message size

Note that this patch release fixes a potential denial of service attack (reported by Team82 / Claroty).

The default configuration previously allowed messages to have an arbitrary size (number of chunks).

open62541 (<http://open62541.org/>) is an open source and free implementation of OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) written in the common subset of the C99 and C++98 languages. The library is usable with all major compilers and provides the necessary tools to implement dedicated OPC UA clients and servers, or to integrate OPC UA-based communication into existing applications. The open62541 library is platform independent. All platform-specific functionality is implemented via exchangeable plugins. Plugin implementations are provided for the major operating systems.

open62541 is licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPLv2). This allows the open62541 library to be combined and distributed as part of proprietary software. Only changes to the files of the open62541 library itself need to be licensed under the MPLv2 when copied and distributed. The plugins, as well as the server and client examples are in the public domain (CC0 license). They can be reused under any license and changes do not have to be published.

New features compared to the previous release series 1.1 are:

* Support for additional OPC UA Services (SetTriggering, TransferSubscription)
* Support for more data-types: structures with optional fields and for unions
* Support for pretty-printing of OPC UA data-types
* Support for parsing of standard-defined human-readable NodeIds, BrowsePaths, etc.
* Support for OpenSSL-based encryption and certificate validation
* Support for WebSocket Secure (wss)
* Improved support for Events and Alarms&Conditions
* Improved support for PubSub subscribers
* Improved support for realtime PubSub by integration with external interrupt handling and a configurable realtime "fast path"
* Update to the v1.04 nodeset definitions from the OPC Foundation

Besides the major functional additions, many small features, fixes and general improvements went into this release.

With the release of the release candidate, the API for the 1.2 release series is frozen. Only fixes and non-breaking changes will be integrated going forward. Note that the v1.2 release family contains new features compared to v1.0. These have not been part of the certification that was achieved for the example server based on the v1.0 release.

This is the first patch release for the 1.3 release family of open62541.

There were only bugfixes and no API-breaking changes applied for the patch release.

Changes compared to the previous release include:

* refactor(plugin): Transition mbedTLS to the API for both v2 and v3
* fix(client): Replace the nonce with the ActivateSessionResponse
* fix(plugin): Add default limits for chunks and message size

Note that this patch release fixes a potential denial of service attack (reported by Team82 / Claroty).

The default configuration previously allowed messages to have an arbitrary size (number of chunks).

open62541 (<http://open62541.org/>) is an open source and free implementation of OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) written in the common subset of the C99 and C++98 languages. The library is usable with all major compilers and provides the necessary tools to implement dedicated OPC UA clients and servers, or to integrate OPC UA-based communication into existing applications. The open62541 library is platform independent. All platform-specific functionality is implemented via exchangeable plugins. Plugin implementations are provided for the major operating systems.

open62541 is licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPLv2). This allows the open62541 library to be combined and distributed as part of proprietary software. Only changes to the files of the open62541 library itself need to be licensed under the MPLv2 when copied and distributed. The plugins, as well as the server and client examples are in the public domain (CC0 license). They can be reused under any license and changes do not have to be published.

New features compared to the previous release series 1.2 include:

* Support for OPC UA PubSub encryption (also TPM-based key handling)
* Session authentication with x509 certificates (server-side)
* Support for Event Filters
* Support for Server Diagnostics
* Binary/JSON encoding as a stable public API
* Handling of Subscriptions with different priority
* Greatly improved Nodeset Compiler, including support for structure values
* Added UA\_order function for all data types (equality test / absolute ordering for binary search trees, etc.)
* Support for TLS-encrypted MQTT-based PubSub
* Internally generate temporary self-signed certificates

Besides the major functional additions, many small features, fixes and general improvements went into this release. Particularly, the memory consumption of the information model was reduced by about 1/3 compared to the 1.2 release series.

Note that the v1.3 release family contains new features compared to v1.0. These have not been part of the certification that was achieved for the example server based on the v1.0 release.

#### Introduced: 22 Aug 2022

[CVE-2022-25761 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25761) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `open62541/open62541` to version 1.2.5, 1.3.1 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the `Final` closing chunk.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5¬†high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed ‚Äúremotely exploitable‚Äù and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
