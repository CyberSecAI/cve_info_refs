Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper limits on the number of received chunks and message size in the open62541 library. The default configuration allowed messages to have an unlimited size (number of chunks).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Limitation on Chunk Count:** The software did not enforce a maximum limit on the number of message chunks received, either per single session or for all concurrent sessions.
- **Missing Limitation on Message Size:** The software did not limit the overall size of a message, allowing it to grow excessively with multiple large chunks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by sending an unlimited number of large chunks (e.g., 2GB each) without sending the final chunk. This would lead to excessive memory consumption and potentially crash or cripple the service, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is network-accessible, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable open62541 service.
- **Ability to Send Malicious Chunks:** The attacker must be able to craft and send OPC UA messages containing a large number of chunks without a closing chunk.
- **No Authentication Required (Potentially):** The issue can be exploited without a valid, trusted client certificate.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Team82 (Claroty Research).
- The fix involves adding default limits for chunks and message size (2 << 14 chunks and 512 MB for the message size).
- The vulnerability affects open62541 versions prior to 1.2.5 and 1.3.1.
- The fix was implemented in commit `b79db1ac78146fc06b0b8435773d3967de2d659c`.

This information is consistent with the description provided by Snyk, which highlights the missing limitation on received chunks and the potential for a denial-of-service attack by sending unlimited huge chunks. The provided Github commit `b79db1a` shows the code changes that addresses this issue and this is further substantiated in the release notes for versions 1.2.5 and 1.3.1

In summary, this vulnerability is a classic resource exhaustion DoS caused by unbounded message handling, and the fixes ensure that message sizes and chunk counts are limited.
