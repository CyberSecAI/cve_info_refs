- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the `order` and `orderby` parameters before using them in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI). Specifically, the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input within SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can potentially lead to data exfiltration, data modification, or complete control of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the `order` and `orderby` parameters in the `admin.php?page=tp_editor&action=filter-by` URL within the WordPress admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator (Admin+) to access the vulnerable admin page.
