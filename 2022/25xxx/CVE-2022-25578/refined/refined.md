- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Arbitrary file editing vulnerability in taocms3.0.2 allows an attacker to modify the `.htaccess` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows modification of the `.htaccess` file through its file management interface. This enables an attacker to inject directives into the file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By adding `AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3` to the `.htaccess` file, files with the `.php3` extension are then executed as PHP files. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by uploading a file with a `.php3` extension.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves using the file management interface to modify the `.htaccess` file and uploading a `.php3` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the file management interface within the taocms application to modify the `.htaccess` file.
