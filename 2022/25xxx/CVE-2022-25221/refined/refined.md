- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Money Transfer Management System Version 1.0 is vulnerable to DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code into the URL, which is then executed when a user visits the crafted link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DOM-Based XSS vulnerability, where user-controlled input in the URL parameter `page` is not properly sanitized or encoded before being used in the client-side script, allowing execution of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit the malicious URL. This could lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, defacing the website, or other malicious activities, though the provided CVSS score indicates only low impact on data integrity and no impact on confidentiality or availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code injected via the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into visiting it. No special access or authentication is required. The attacker does not need to directly interact with the web server; rather, they rely on the victim's browser to execute the JavaScript code from the URL.
