# Network Olympus 1.8.0 - SQL Injection

## Summary

|  |  |

| **Name** | Network Olympus 1.8.0 - SQL Injection |
| **Code name** | [Spinetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta) |
| **Product** | Network Olympus |
| **Affected versions** | Version 1.8.0 |
|
| **State** | Public |
| **Release date** | 2022-03-07 |

## Vulnerability

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Kind** | SQL injection |
| **Rule** | [146. SQL injection](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/vulnerabilities/146/) |
| **Remote** | Yes |
| **CVSSv3.1 Vector** | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| **CVSSv3.1 Base Score** | 9.1 |
| **Exploit available** | No |
| **CVE ID(s)** | [CVE-2022-25225](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25225) |

## Description

Network Olympus **version 1.8.0** allows an authenticated admin user to inject
SQL queries in `/api/eventinstance` via the `sqlparameter`. It is also possible
to achieve remote code execution in the default installation (PostgreSQL)
by exploiting this issue.

## Proof of Concept

Steps to reproduce

1. Log in to Network Olympus.
2. The application send a request to `/api/eventinstance`
   with a json as parameter in the url, the json parameter
   `sqlparameter` allows to inject sql queries. It can be
   exploited using boolean based sql or stacked queries.
3. The following PoC can be used to make the database sleep for 2 seconds.

   ```
     /api/eventinstance/{"pagenumber":1,"itemsperpage":100,"order":"asc","sqlparameter":[],"sqlstring":"1=1%2f%2a%2a%2f;select%2f%2a%2a%2fpg_sleep(2);--"}

   ```
4. To achieve command execution it is possible to create a malicious
   DLL and then load it in postgresql.
5. Create a malicious postgres [DLL extension](https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2016/06/windows-dll-to-shell-postgres-servers.html).
6. Create a copy of the exploit found in the following session
   and copy the generated DLL to the same folder
   and rename it to `rev_shell.dll`.

System Information

* Version: Network Olympus 1.8.0 (Trial Version).
* Operating System: Windows 10.
* Database and version: PostgreSQL 10.8,
  compiled by Visual C++ build 1800, 32-bit.

## Exploit
