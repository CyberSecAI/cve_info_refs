{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper input sanitization in the `simple-git` library allowed the use of potentially malicious git options (`--upload-pack`, `--receive-pack`, `-u` in `clone`, and `--exec` in `push`) that could lead to remote code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the system where the `simple-git` library is used.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious git options into the `clone()`, `pull()`, `push()` and `listRemote()` methods.",
        "Specifically, the options `--upload-pack`, `--receive-pack`, `-u` in clone, and `--exec` in push"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the arguments passed to the vulnerable functions of the `simple-git` library."
  },
  "affected_versions": "<3.16.0",
  "fix_versions": ">=3.16.0",
   "details": "The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-25912. The fix blocks the usage of the vulnerable options by default, requiring users to explicitly enable them using the `allowUnsafePack` option in the configuration."
