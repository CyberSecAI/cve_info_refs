# CVE-2022-25854: Stored XSS in @yaireo/tagify npm module

  [Leave a Comment](https://bsg.tech/blog/cve-2022-25854-stored-xss-in-yaireo-tagify-npm-module/#respond) / [BSG News](https://bsg.tech/blog/category/bsg-news/) / By   [Roman Rott](https://bsg.tech/blog/author/rrott/ "View all posts by Roman Rott")
## Preface

Due to the russian war on Ukraine, we are much less active on this blog and social media. However, some events make us hit the dust off the keyboard and share some information. For instance, a vulnerability is worth a CVE. We found this one in February 2022, and a few others are under review. Meanwhile, all BSG team members are safe, and we stay operational.

## Introduction

*Tagify* is a tags input component for React, Vue, and Angular that can also be used as a standalone library in pure JavaScript. It transforms an input field or a *textarea* into a Tags component.

![Tagify example.](https://bsg.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image.png)

A Tagify example.

Tagify resources and project homepage:

* <https://yaireo.github.io/tagify/>
* <https://github.com/yairEO/tagify>
* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yaireo/tagify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40yaireo/tagify)

## Summary

A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue was discovered in @yaireo/tagify versions before 4.9.8 ([CVE-2022-25854](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25854)). An attacker could exploit it by storing persistent scripts, which would lead to arbitrary code execution when visiting an affected page.

## Impact

Tagify is a quite popular JavaScript library: there are 38 000 weekly downloads on npm and 24 packages depending on @yaireo/tagify.

## Technical Summary

While testing custom inputs functionality on a website, we observed that the “tags” parameter was not sanitized against cross-site scripting attacks when loading the data via the user’s profile page.

Deep dive into the code base showed that the bug is in Tagify’s template wrapper, leading to an XSS vulnerability, making applications that use *tagify.js* or *react.tagify* vulnerable as well.

![XSS example.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746383/154299907-a9a6de1e-4cda-428c-9aef-eaf22208fa56.png)

The XSS example.

## Affected Code

<https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/blob/f74c1570496f76ba798062680529efea7b5b1332/src/parts/templates.js#L13>

`data-placeholder="${_s.placeholder || '&#8203;'}"
aria-placeholder="${_s.placeholder || ''}"`

Example on Codesandbox: <https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-lgs3er?file=/src/CrazyTags.jsx:392-443>

Tagify’s API does not provide any documented options to add *onhover*, *onclick*, etc., handlers using the placeholder prop. There is no way to add the handlers using any other props described in the *TagifyWrapper.propTypes* object, except placeholder. It is undocumented, unintended, and unexpected behavior.

## Pull request

<https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/commit/198c0451fad188390390395ccfc84ab371def4c7>

## Disclosure Timeline

* 2022-02-11 Bug discovered.
* 2022-02-15 Found the source of the bug.
* 2022-02-15 Created PoC.
* 2022-02-16 Disclosure to vendor.
* 2022-02-16 Pull Request with the fix was sent to the vendor.
* 2022-02-17 Vendor informed us that it would be fixed with the following product version (v4.9.8).
* 2022-02-17 Vendor published a fixed product version (v4.9.8).

## Proof of Concept

1. Open the following forked Tagify’s React Wrapper demo.
2. Notice [line #17](https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-lgs3er?file=/src/CrazyTags.jsx:392-443), where a *customUserInput* variable is declared. This variable mocks data that came from an API or an input.
3. On [line #23](https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-lgs3er?file=/src/CrazyTags.jsx:571-636), we use the customUserInput variable to customize tags.
4. Open the Tags tab once the demo app is rendered and hover on the first input. It will fire the XSS.

The XSS Proof of Concept.

# Solution

As of the date of this publication, all versions above 4.9.8 are safe to use.

| Prerequisites  * I am running the latest version * I checked the documentation and found no answer * I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed  💥 Demo Page ***React*** issue template: [tagify-react-wrapper-forked](https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-lgs3er?file=/src/CrazyTags.jsx:287-340) Explanation We have found a bug in tagify's template wrapper that leads to XSS vulnerability, making applications that use `tagify.js` or `react.tagify` vulnerable as well.  An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user's browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page. Refs: <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/> <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html> Affected file: <https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/blob/master/src/parts/templates.js#L13>  ``` data-placeholder="${_s.placeholder || '&#8203;'}" aria-placeholder="${_s.placeholder || ''}" ```  Example on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-c6ozp2?file=/src/MixedModeTagify.jsx) Steps to reproduce:  1. Open the following forked Tagify's React Wrapper demo 2. Notice [line #17](https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-lgs3er?file=/src/CrazyTags.jsx:392-443) where a `customUserInput` variable is declared. This variable mocks data that came from an API or an input. 3. On the line [#23](https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-lgs3er?file=/src/CrazyTags.jsx:571-636) we use the `customUserInput` variable to customize tags. 4. Once the demo app is rendered, open the "Tags" tab and hover on the first input. It will fire the XSS.   The following screenshot shows the XSS run on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-c6ozp2?file=/src/MixedModeTagify.jsx) [Screenshot 2022-02-16 at 16 40 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746383/154294332-15e25fb1-2bea-413d-b9b9-31cde15697fb.png)  The following screenshot shows the same XSS run in the dev build of the app. [Screenshot 2022-02-16 at 17 36 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746383/154299907-a9a6de1e-4cda-428c-9aef-eaf22208fa56.png)  As you see, the tagify builds a new span with an attribute that was not supposed to be there. |

| Hi rrott, thank you for the detailed analysis  Why is this a Tagify issue?  It's up the the developer which uses Tagify to sanitize the content before saving it in the database.  front-end code assumes all content sent from the app's API (and from DB to API) has already been verified before it was saved to the DB. |

| 0. all developers make mistakes. It is better to supply them with more reliable and secure tools and libs.\ 1. tagify's API does not provide any documented options to add onhover/onclick/etc handlers using the `placeholder` prop. There is no way to add the handlers using any other props described in the `TagifyWrapper.propTypes` object, except `placeholder`. It is undocumented, unintended, and unexpected behavior, so it is definitely a bug. And this bug leads to the XSS vulnerability. 2. Tagify builds the malicious `<span/>` tag and adds it to the DOM cause it uses untrusted input without any validation and sanitization. Never insert untrusted data and attribute encode before inserting untrusted data into HTML common attributes 3. database and API are not the only sources of malicious data. 4. developers do not know about this "feature" and may send unsanitized data to the component because they trust you. Additionally, this lib can be used as a part of another library, theme, or framework, and the end-users who do not know what lib they use for tags are affected as well 5. it is always better to have sanitization on both front-end and back-end parts altogether.   \*as for the point 1) - it's not only about adding a custom attribute. It is about adding any HTML or JavaScript code and running it in the users' browsers.

| It is highly unlikely a developer will write javascript, intentionally, within the `placeholder` setting, which will harm the users, and if such developer does this, then that developer can basically do a million other things, because they are the author of their program.  If a developer writes this, then he/she did this on purpose with full knowledge what will happen.  Also, there are [custom templates](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify#dom-templates) which a developer might use, so by your logic, the developer can also add any javascript there as well, so adding stuff to the HTML can happen in several places where the developer has control over, for example:  ``` let tagify = new Tagify(inputElm, {     placeholder: 'x "onmouseover=\"alert(1)\""',     templates: {         tag(tagData, tagify){             var _s = this.settings;             return `<tag title="${(tagData.title || tagData.value)}"                         contenteditable='false'                         spellcheck='false'                         tabIndex="${_s.a11y.focusableTags ? 0 : -1}"                         class="${_s.classNames.tag} ${tagData.class || ""}"                         ${this.getAttributes(tagData)}>                 <x title='' class="${_s.classNames.tagX}" role='button' aria-label='remove tag'></x>                 <div onmouseover=\"alert(1)\">                     123                 </div>             </tag>`         },     }, ```  Can you please tell me how would such malicious code might gets to those settings without a developer intentionally wrote it? |

| I've created the PR [989](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/pull/989), which uses your internal helper, designed precisely for that purpose. The fix:   * does not add anything new. * does not make code unreadable or unsupportable. * breaks nothing. * And it fixes the XSS.   I cannot understand why you tend to reject it?  Here is an example of such a typical behavior: [tagify-react-wrapper-forked](https://codesandbox.io/s/tagify-react-wrapper-forked-lgs3er?file=/src/CrazyTags.jsx:287-340) E.g., developers may want to personalize placeholders, adding custom text using template literal. They do not wish to hard-code something malicious; all they need is to make their app fancy. The variable can be either taken from a database, API, 3rd party library, or anywhere else - it does not matter. The problem is that Tagyfy gets untrusted input, builds the malicious code, and puts it directly into the DOM. [Screenshot 2022-02-16 at 23 41 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746383/154362108-4509af7f-46e1-459a-a8be-08cb752ced19.png) An attacker, not the developer, could put the XSS payload.  All the breaches, hacks, and data losses result from somebody's mistake. Many developers use StackOverflow, copy-paste code, skip testing, etc., etc. None is perfect - even Tagify has a bug and unexpected behavior.  so by your logic, the developer can also add any javascript there as well, so adding stuff to the HTML can happen in several places where the developer has control over  No, the logic is: developers do not expect Tagify to parse and render XSS payloads. It is undocumented and dangerous behavior. |

| I've seen your PR and the fix was done in the wrong place, since many developers are using custom templates, which your fix does not address.  I cannot understand why you tend to reject it?  Because I do not agree with your level of panic and I believe none of what you've said will ever happen. Nobody ever will use a placeholder from a 3rd-party script, while that is possible, it will not happen.  I just don't understand what do you get from all this and why are you doing all this? what is you agenda? are you randomly going over open-source code and checking for potential vulnerabilities, or are you a Tagify user? |

| Check my acc to see that you are wrong. I saw this bug in the wild, in a real project. The issue's root was in Tagify, so PR was sent to improve it. It's open-source, is not it? I came up with a bug report and a solution; nobody blames the lib.  Let's discuss the PR. I am unfamiliar with Tagify's codebase, and I can be wrong. What can I do to improve it? Do you want me to move sanitization to any other place? I thought that as the root of the issue is injecting payloads in the wrapper function, the fix should be there. As I understand, this `wrapper` is a built-in standalone template, but developers can write any other custom template. They definitely may write buggy and vulnerable templates, and it is hard to prevent them from doing this, but their code is under their control, while `wrapper` comes with the lib and can't be updated/fixed without monkey-patching or forking the whole lib. That's the point. |

#### Introduced: 17 Feb 2022

[CVE-2022-25854  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25854) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-79  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `@yaireo/tagify` to version 4.9.8 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The package is used for rendering UI components inside the input or text fields, and an attacker can pass a malicious placeholder value to it to fire the XSS payload.

## Details

A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.

This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.

Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.

The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.

### Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
| **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
| **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
| **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

### Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

* Web servers
* Application servers
* Web application environments

### How to prevent

This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:

* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.
* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
* Redirect invalid requests.
* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.4 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
