Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `dpassword` parameter of the `/admin-panel1.php` page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed in the administrator's browser when they access the `/admin-panel1.php` page. This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, defacement of the admin panel, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects the XSS payload via the `dpassword` parameter when submitting the "Add Doctors" form (or using burpsuite to modify the POST request). The payload is stored and then triggered when the admin views the `admin-panel1.php` page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the `/admin-panel1.php` page. This can be achieved by filling the form and intercepting with burpsuite or similar tools. The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated to submit the form (depending on the application's design). An admin needs to access the page after the data with the payload has been submitted to trigger the vulnerability.
