### Severity

 Recommended 0.0medium010

CVSS assessment made by Snyk's Security Team. [Learn more](/vuln/SNYK-JS-LIQUIDJS-2952868#cvss)

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)
for more details.

#### Introduced: 18 Jul 2022

[CVE-2022-25948  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25948) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-200  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `liquidjs` to version 10.0.0 or higher.

## Overview

[liquidjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/liquidjs) is an A simple, expressive, safe and Shopify compatible template engine in pure JavaScript.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure when `ownPropertyOnly` parameter is set to `False`, which results in leaking properties of a prototype.

## Workaround

For versions 9.34.0 and higher, an option to disable this functionality is provided.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

| I noticed that javascript string and array prototype functions may be getting leaked. I actually like some of them like `str.length` or `arr_var.length` rather than using `str | size` or `arr_var | size`. This seems to be non-standard liquid templating.  I'm just asking because I would like to keep the `.length` since it is more ergonomic when used in `{% if str.length > 5 %} ... {% endif %}`  I'm worried it may be removed in a future "fix". Is this a bug or a feature that getters like .length or .toUpperCase work? |

| And if you do plan on removing access to the getter functions, I wonder if there could be flag to keep the existing functionality. something like  ``` const liquid = new Liquid({   jsTruthy: true,   allowedJsGetters: ['length', <etc>.. ] }); ``` |

| Related to [#254](https://github.com/harttle/liquidjs/issues/254) but this is more specific. I'll treat this as a feature request and leave this open for further discussion.  I don't have a good idea to restrict prototype access since we had discussion on [#254](https://github.com/harttle/liquidjs/issues/254), because we cannot tell whether a property is from prototype or not. Currently we rely on users only pass sanitized plain object into LiquidJS as scope and modifying builtin prototype is considered bad practice.  Consider this case:  ``` let proto = { foo: 'FOO' } let obj1 = Object.create(proto) let obj2 = Object.create(proto) obj2.foo = 'FOO'  isFromProto(obj1, 'foo') // expect true isFromProto(obj2, 'foo') // expect false  // we cannot implement such a `isFromProto` for both of following are true obj1.__proto__.foo === obj1.foo obj2.__proto__.foo === obj2.foo ```  A white list like `allowedJsGetters` will affect all objects and that property would be nolonger valid as variable/property name. Need more discussion. Maybe removing `__proto__` recursively on `scope` is also a solution? |

| I’ll ask one of JS experts his thoughts on this. My initial thought would be to use the hasOwnProperty() method to check if the key belongs to the object or is it inherited. I’m not sure if you have considered this?

| use the hasOwnProperty() method to check if the key belongs to the object  Good idea. It works fine with the above the above case I posted, and also works for `Array.prototype.length`.  ``` Object.hasOwnProperty(Object.create({foo: 'foo'}), 'foo') // false Object.hasOwnProperty([1,2], 'length') // false class Foo { foo() {} } Object.hasOwnProperty(new Foo(), 'foo') // false, does this make sense? ```  Would you be able to point me to the code that executes the inherited method?

Perhaps a solution using [Object.propertyIsEnumerable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/propertyIsEnumerable) would be more appropriate.  ``` Object.propertyIsEnumerable.call(Object.create({foo: 'foo'}), 'foo') // false Object.propertyIsEnumerable.call([1,2], 'length') // false Object.propertyIsEnumerable.call("", 'length') // false ``` |

Yes, that is not solving the "eg, .length" isssue, but it does solve "reading from prototype" issue. By definition, use `hasOwnProperty` can prevent from reading from prototype chain (chained `__proto__` property in most implementations).  Actually `.length` is not on the prototype, as you can see in:  ``` // own property > [1,2].length 2 // prototype also has this property, but not the intended one > [1,2].__proto__.length ```  Here's a better explanation on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50999669/why-arrays-have-a-given-property-length-why-its-not-in-prototype) about why it's not on prototype. And I don't think reading array length in template is a potential security issue, it's an `Array` after all, otherwise why not use object.  BTW, `Object.hasOwnProperty([1,2], 'length')` is a misuse, the `[1,2]` will be interperated as `property name` and `length` will be ignored. This call will always return false for any object. Further explained:  ``` > a = {foo: 'bar'} { foo: 'bar' } // aparently > a.hasOwnProperty('foo') true // Object don't have a a property > Object.hasOwnProperty(a, 'foo') false // Object.create is its own property > Object.hasOwnProperty('create') true ``` |
