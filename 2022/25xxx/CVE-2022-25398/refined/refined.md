Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `user` parameter. The vulnerability is triggered through the Referer HTTP header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates the user-provided 'user' parameter from the Referer header into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially gain full control of all user accounts of the system.
- The attacker can potentially read and modify data in the database.
- The attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, which can lead to more serious consequences.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the Referer HTTP header, which can be manipulated by the attacker.
- Specifically, the `user` parameter within the Referer header is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the Referer header of the HTTP requests.
- The attacker can be external (not needing to be on the local network).

**Technical Details:**
- The provided content highlights the SQL injection vulnerability with specific payloads designed to extract information or cause time delays in the database:
   - **Boolean-based blind SQL Injection:** `user=admin1' AND 5432=5432 AND 'MXPx'='MXPx&password=admin1&btnlogin=` This payload aims to test for true/false conditions.
   - **Error-based SQL injection:** `user=admin1' AND (SELECT 8861 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x71786b6271,(SELECT (ELT(8861=8861,1))),0x71706b7171,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'aOSP'='aOSP&password=admin1&btnlogin=` This payload forces a specific error by using the `FLOOR` function to gather information from the database.
   - **Time-based blind SQL injection:** `user=admin1' AND (SELECT 1749 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(3)))XjEM) AND 'xoHI'='xoHI&password=admin1&btnlogin=` This payload causes a time delay using `SLEEP` to confirm the injection.

The content also mentions that a database error message is returned when a single quote (') is submitted in the Referer header, further confirming the vulnerability.
