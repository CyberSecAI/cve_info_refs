      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to bypass the autoType restrictions in fastjson under specific conditions, allowing for the deserialization of untrusted data.",

        "Manipulation of JSON data to include malicious payloads"

        "The vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 1.2.80.",
        "The fix involves changes to autoType behavior, which may cause incompatibility in certain scenarios.",
