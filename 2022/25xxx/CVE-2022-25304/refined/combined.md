#### Introduced: 22 Aug 2022

[CVE-2022-25304  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25304) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `opcua`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the `Final` closing chunk.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

| We would like to responsibly report on a vulnerability we found in python opcua. Where should we send our detailed report?  Additionally I would like to suggest adding a security policy to the repository to help other security researchers reach out to you properly.  Thanks!

| Hi [@SharonBrizinov](https://github.com/SharonBrizinov)  `python-opcua` is deprecated, but not archived at the moment.  Please try out, if that security issue still exists in <https://github.com/FreeOpcUa/opcua-asyncio> as well.  [@oroulet](https://github.com/oroulet) if this is still the case then, what would be the prefered way then? Just opening an issue or dealing with it in another way? |

| Just open a bug request and use the word security. That will work.  Also when I started that project my goal was to be able to connect to the PLC around from python. Just being able to connect was a huge sucess and security was really not my concern (It is still not since 99% of the time I work on closed systems ONE pc, ONE plc with one cable) and I am sure python-opcua is full of security issues. Just a simple code review would point out many issues, up until a few weeeks ago, you could send queries to our server, without even opening the secure channel.... Unforunately it is also the situation for opcua-asyncio.  When this is said, if someone has the time and interest to look at code and document the main issues it would be great. Even better propose fixes and implement them ;-) |

| I am not really sure what to do. We are not a private organization. If the issue is disclosed in public there is much more chance that someone is interested and fixes than if you send it to me or a few others that may not have time to look at it.  Also if someone want to find an security issues in opcua.asyncio, he probably ust need to look at code a few minutes.... |

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).
