Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing limitation on the number of received chunks in the `opcua` and `asyncua` packages. This lack of restriction applies both to individual sessions and across all concurrent sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unbounded Chunk Reception:** The software does not limit the number of data chunks received, allowing an attacker to send a large amount of data without proper handling.
- **Missing Final Chunk Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker sends a large number of data chunks without sending the closing "Final" chunk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, making the affected system inaccessible to legitimate users. This can lead to downtime.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The unlimited reception of large chunks (e.g., 2GB each) can lead to high memory consumption, potentially causing the service to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerable component is exposed to the network.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send crafted requests to the vulnerable system.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authorization or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects `opcua` package versions prior to a fix and `asyncua` package versions before 0.9.96.
- The vulnerability is present in both `python-opcua` and `opcua-asyncio` due to shared codebase.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).

This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending an unlimited number of large chunks without closing the connection with a final chunk.
