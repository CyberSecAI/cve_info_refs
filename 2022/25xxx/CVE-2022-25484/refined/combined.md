| **Describe the bug** The assertion `assert(l2len > 0);` in packet2tree() at tree.c is reachable when the user uses tcpprep to open a crafted pcap file. The variable `l2len` is assigned in get\_l2len\_protocol() at get.c.     [tcpreplay/src/tree.c](https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/blob/09f07748dcabe3d58961f123f31dd0f75198a389/src/tree.c#L733-L746)  Lines 733 to 746 in [09f0774](/appneta/tcpreplay/commit/09f07748dcabe3d58961f123f31dd0f75198a389)   |  | res = get\_l2len\_protocol(data, | | --- | --- | |  | pkt\_len, | |  | datalink, | |  | &ether\_type, | |  | &l2len, | |  | &l2offset, | |  | &vlan\_offset); | |  |  | |  | if (res == -1) | |  | goto len\_error; | |  |  | |  | node = new\_tree(); | |  |  | |  | assert(l2len > 0); |      However, when the `datalink` is `DLT_RAW` or `DLT_JUNIPER_ETHER`, `l2len` is assigned with 0, and the assertion is triggered.     [tcpreplay/src/common/get.c](https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/blob/09f07748dcabe3d58961f123f31dd0f75198a389/src/common/get.c#L268-L282)  Lines 268 to 282 in [09f0774](/appneta/tcpreplay/commit/09f07748dcabe3d58961f123f31dd0f75198a389)   |  | \*l2len = 0; | | --- | --- | |  | \*l2offset = 0; | |  | \*vlan\_offset = 0; | |  |  | |  | switch (datalink) { | |  | case DLT\_RAW: | |  | if (datalen == 0) | |  | return -1; | |  |  | |  | if ((pktdata[0] >> 4) == 4) | |  | \*protocol = ETHERTYPE\_IP; | |  | else if ((pktdata[0] >> 4) == 6) | |  | \*protocol = ETHERTYPE\_IP6; | |  | break; | |  | case DLT\_JUNIPER\_ETHER: |      **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Get the Tcpreplay source code (master [09f0774](https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/commit/09f07748dcabe3d58961f123f31dd0f75198a389)) and compile it. 2.

| Closing as "Cannot reproduce" however I believe that whatever you are seeing may be fixed with [#716](https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/issues/716). |
