The provided content is a Jenkins security advisory that includes information about CVE-2022-25205.

**CVE-2022-25205**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `dbCharts` plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation, and this method does not require POST requests resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Missing permission check in a form validation method.
    *   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability because the method does not require POST requests.
    *   The method allows to determine if a class is available on the Jenkins controller's classpath through error messages.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified database via JDBC using attacker-specified credentials, potentially gaining access to sensitive data in the database.
    *   Attackers can determine the existence of specific classes on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Network access to the Jenkins controller.
    *   Attacker needs Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission check.
    *   Attacker can trigger the vulnerable method through a crafted GET request (due to CSRF vulnerability).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Network access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
