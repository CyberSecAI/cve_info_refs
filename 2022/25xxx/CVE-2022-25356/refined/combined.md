# **Satisfied Customers** Share Why They've Switched Platforms

"We implemented our own Exchange server, and we had the need to have an antispam that would help us to be free to monitor it and that the same user with a single click could release his email, and this software was what we needed"

**Cesar H., IT Admin.***Switched from Barracuda Gateway*

"We moved from Exchange Online Protection after trialing several alternatives (both on-prem and cloud based). Security Gateway was the perfect sweet spot. Spam capabilities are far superior to EOP. For the price you get all the expected features and a lot of extra goodies too."

**Bill R. , Director of IT***Switched from Exchange Online Protection*

"With Security Gateway in place I get a little better sleep at night knowing my Exchange Server and entire network is better protected from the nasty stuff out there. Out of the box, it's probably one of the easiest pieces of software to implement."

**John G., VP***Switched from GFI*

UNDER ATTACK?
## Security Advisory: Alt-n Security Gateway (CVE-2022-25356)

       ![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alt-in_Tavola-disegno-1.png)

Swascan Offensive Security Team has identified **1** vulnerability on **Alt-n Security Gateway** product, the vulnerability was found during a Penetration Test.

## Product description

*Alt-n* develops and manufactures products and solutions for companies to help them be more safe against phishing attacks, malwares and much more, Security Gateway accomplishes that goal giving protection from external/internal email threats.

Swascan worked together with Alt-n in order to fix this vulnerability.

## Technical summary

Swascan’s Cyber Security Team found an important vulnerability on: Security Gateway

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MicrosoftTeams-image-24-1024x618.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MicrosoftTeams-image-24.png)

| **Vulnerability** | **CVSSv3.1** | **Severity** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Unauthenticated registration key disclosure through XML Injection** | **7.5 High** | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |

In the following section the technical details about this vulnerability, including evidence and a proof-of-concept.

## Vulnerability details

#### Unauthenticated registration key disclosure through XML Injection

## Description

In Alt-n Security Gateway product, a malicious actor could inject an arbitrary XML argument by adding a new parameter in the HTTP request URL. In this way the XML parser fails the validation process disclosing information such as kind of protection used (2FA), admin email and product registration keys.

## Proof of Concept

The following POC will inject an arbitrary XML argument in the processed XML retrieving the SecurityGateway configuration through the error message:

# curl -kis “http://<target>/SecurityGateway.dll?view=login&redirect=true&9OW4L7RSDY=1”

The result of the previous curl is the following:

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Immagine1.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Immagine1.png)

Figure 1  Security settings, admin information and product registration key disclosed

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Immagine2.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Immagine2.png)

Figure 2  Working registration key for product update

## Impact

An attacker can use the information retrieved to try to authenticate as admin user through brute force attacks, password guessing or using compromised credentials, (since the admin email address used is known).  The product registration keys can be compromised as well.

## Remediation

The application should not trust user input and avoid incorporating inside the XML arbitrary URL parameters and/or sanitize the input by encoding the characters “<>” with the corresponding entities “&lt; and &gt”.

Alt-n released a patch for the MDaemon software, reported in the references below.
