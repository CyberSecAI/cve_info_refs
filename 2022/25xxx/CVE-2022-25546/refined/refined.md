```
Root cause of vulnerability: The `formSetSysToolDDNS` function in the Tenda AX1806 router copies the `ddnsUser` parameter from an HTTP request into a stack variable without any bounds checking.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack overflow due to the use of `strcpy` to copy an unchecked length of user-provided input.

Impact of exploitation: Denial of Service (DoS) - the stack overflow can crash the device.

Attack vectors: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` endpoint with a long `ddnsUser` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This is likely a network-adjacent attack.
