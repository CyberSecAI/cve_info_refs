### **[julianhille](/julianhille)** commented [Jun 28, 2022](#issue-1287946687) • edited Loading

| O once found a crash when pdfstreamforresponse is used with bs data.  Needs fixing.  "electron": "4.2.9", "hummus": "^1.0.105",  Reproduce is as simple as this:  ```   hummus = require('muhammara')   writer = new hummus.PDFStreamForResponse(null)   writer = hummus.createWriter(writer)   writer.end()  ```  The object `PDFStreamForResponse` does take ANYTHING as value. This later will be used to write the header to int and so goes through WriteComment in hummus.  The node/electron call to v8:V8:toLocalEmpty kills it and jumps bad in memory.  Parts of the stack to follow:  ``` Thread 0 Crashed:: CrBrowserMain  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread 0   com.github.Electron.framework 	0x00000001069702f0 0x104c13000 + 30790384 1   com.github.Electron.framework 	0x0000000106397560 v8::V8::ToLocalEmpty() + 64 2   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e2fcff1 ObjectByteWriterWithPosition::Write(unsigned char const*, unsigned long) + 615 3   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e33cfed ObjectsContext::WriteComment(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&) + 35 4   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e320c49 PDFHummus::DocumentContext::WriteHeader(EPDFVersion) + 23 5   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e2f34bc PDFWriterDriver::StartPDF(v8::Local<v8::Object>, EPDFVersion, LogConfiguration const&, PDFCreationSettings const&) + 90 6   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e2fdfc4 CreateWriter(v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value> const&) + 2778```  Could be easily fixed if at leasdt some null / undefined checks are done here.  ``` |

| "electron": "4.2.9", "hummus": "^1.0.105",  Reproduce is as simple as this:  ```   hummus = require('hummus')   writer = new hummus.PDFStreamForResponse(null)   writer = hummus.createWriter(writer)   writer.end()  ```  The object `PDFStreamForResponse` does take ANYTHING as value. This later will be used to write the header to int and so goes through WriteComment in hummus.  The node/electron call to v8:V8:toLocalEmpty kills it and jumps bad in memory.  Parts of the stack to follow:  ``` Thread 0 Crashed:: CrBrowserMain  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread 0   com.github.Electron.framework 	0x00000001069702f0 0x104c13000 + 30790384 1   com.github.Electron.framework 	0x0000000106397560 v8::V8::ToLocalEmpty() + 64 2   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e2fcff1 ObjectByteWriterWithPosition::Write(unsigned char const*, unsigned long) + 615 3   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e33cfed ObjectsContext::WriteComment(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&) + 35 4   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e320c49 PDFHummus::DocumentContext::WriteHeader(EPDFVersion) + 23 5   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e2f34bc PDFWriterDriver::StartPDF(v8::Local<v8::Object>, EPDFVersion, LogConfiguration const&, PDFCreationSettings const&) + 90 6   hummus.node                   	0x000000010e2fdfc4 CreateWriter(v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value> const&) + 2778```  Could be easily fixed if at leasdt some null / undefined checks are done here.  ``` |

[Report a new vulnerability](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) [Found a mistake?](https://support.snyk.io/s/contactsupport)
#### Introduced: 31 Oct 2022

[CVE-2022-25885  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25885) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `hummus` to version 1.0.111 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when `PDFStreamForResponse()` is used with invalid data.

## PoC

```
hummus = require('muhammara')
writer = new hummus.PDFStreamForResponse(null)
writer = hummus.createWriter(writer)
writer.end()

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

Upgrade `muhammara` to version 2.6.0 or higher.

## Overview

[muhammara](https://www.npmjs.org/package/muhammara) is a Create, read and modify PDF files and streams. A drop in replacement for hummusjs PDF library

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when `PDFStreamForResponse()` is used with invalid data.

## PoC

```
hummus = require('muhammara')
writer = new hummus.PDFStreamForResponse(null)
writer = hummus.createWriter(writer)
writer.end()

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
