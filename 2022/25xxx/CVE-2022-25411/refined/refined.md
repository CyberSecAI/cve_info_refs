Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw that stems from a combination of an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability and insecure file upload configurations. Specifically, the ability to delete the `.htaccess` file in the `~/cms-108/uploads/` directory and the ability to add `php` to the allowed upload file types in the admin panel is what makes this possible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The CMS has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files, specifically `~/cms-108/uploads/.htaccess`.
2.  **Insecure File Upload Configuration:** The CMS allows modification of allowed file types for uploads through the admin panel. By adding `php` to the allowed file types, the attacker bypasses restrictions on uploading malicious php files.
3.  **Lack of input validation:**  The system allows the upload of a php file containing malicious code `<?php @eval($_GET['cmd']);?>` without proper checks to prevent execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the CMS. This could lead to:
* Complete compromise of the server
* Data breaches
* Website defacement
* Further attacks on other systems within the network

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Admin Access:** An attacker must have access to the admin panel to modify the allowed file upload types.
2.  **File Deletion Vulnerability:** An attacker exploits the arbitrary file deletion vulnerability to remove the `.htaccess` file.
3.  **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file after modifying allowed file extensions and removing the `.htaccess`.
4.  **Remote Code Execution:** By accessing the uploaded php file, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Panel Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the administrative interface of the CMS.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of both the arbitrary file deletion and the insecure file upload configuration vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information suggests that a fix was implemented by addressing the Arbitrary File Deletion vulnerability ([#486](https://github.com/maxsite/cms/issues/486)), which is essential for this RCE to be successful, resolving this issue.
* The vulnerability was reported by `fuzzyap1`.
