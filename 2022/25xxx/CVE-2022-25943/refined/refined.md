Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The installer for WPS Office for Windows misconfigures the Access Control List (ACL) for the installation directory of a service program. This leads to a situation where a non-administrative user can modify files in the directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions:** The core issue is the improper ACL configuration on the service program's installation directory, which allows write access to non-admin users.
- The service program is registered and invoked with administrative privileges.
- The service program loads DLL files from the vulnerable directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A non-administrative user can modify, add, or remove files in the service program's installation directory. This includes replacing legitimate DLLs with malicious ones.
- **Code Execution as SYSTEM:** By exploiting the misconfigured ACL, an attacker can plant a malicious DLL. When the service is started (as a service, not user-level), it loads the malicious DLL with elevated privileges. This allows the attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level, gaining full control over the system.
- The attacker can also steal the winlogon token and start cmd as "NT AUTHORITY / System"

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine where WPS Office is installed.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attack involves writing a malicious DLL into a directory where non-admin users have write access because of incorrect ACL settings.
- **Service Restart:** The attacker needs to restart the affected service to trigger the loading of the malicious DLL. This can be done with `net start wpscloudsvr`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Non-administrative user account:** The attacker needs a non-administrative user account on the target Windows system.
- **Local file system access:** The attacker must be able to write to the directory where the service program is installed (due to the misconfigured ACL).
- **Ability to restart service:** The attacker needs to be able to restart the affected service to load the malicious DLL. This can be accomplished using `net start wpscloudsvr`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable directory is `C:\ProgramData\kingsoft\office6\`.
- The vulnerable service is `wpscloudsvr`.
- The specific DLL used in the exploit is `CRYPTSP.DLL`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of WPS Office for Windows prior to v11.2.0.10258.
- The exploit involves replacing the legitimate DLL with a malicious one that changes the administrator password or other SYSTEM level actions.
- The provided CVSS v3 score is 7.8 and the CVSS v2 is 4.3, both indicating high severity.
