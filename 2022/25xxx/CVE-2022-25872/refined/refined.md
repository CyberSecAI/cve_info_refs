Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect memory freeing and length calculation within the `fast-string-search` package when it receives non-string input as the source string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory locations outside of the allocated buffer. This occurs due to the incorrect handling of non-string input, leading to reading from previously allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read previously allocated memory, potentially gaining access to sensitive information that was not intended to be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing non-string input as the source string to the `indexOf` function of the `fast-string-search` package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide arbitrary input to the vulnerable `indexOf` function in order to trigger the issue. No special privileges or user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how passing a number as the source string allows reading data from previously used buffers, not from the current input.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, and has a low attack complexity.
*   There is currently no fix available for this vulnerability.
