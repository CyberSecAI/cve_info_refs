- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `demail` parameter within the `/admin-panel1.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The provided input is stored and later rendered in a way that allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the web admin's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the `demail` parameter when adding doctor information. This is achieved by intercepting the request using Burp Suite or similar tools, modifying the `demail` parameter and then replaying the request. The injected payload is stored and displayed to the web admin when they access `/admin-panel1.php`, leading to the XSS execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application, specifically the "Add Doctor" feature. They also need the ability to intercept and modify the request containing the doctor details (e.g. using Burp Suite), and need knowledge of the target endpoint `/admin-panel1.php`.
