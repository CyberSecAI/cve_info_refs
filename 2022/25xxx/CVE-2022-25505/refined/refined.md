- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `update` function in `\include\Model\Category.php` does not filter the `id` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`id`) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (retrieval of sensitive information from the database).
    - Data modification (altering or deleting data).
    - Complete database compromise.
    - Potential for further system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in HTTP requests sent to the application. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when updating a category in the backend.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
    - The attacker needs access to the administrative interface to trigger the vulnerable functionality.
    - No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, but it is triggered through backend functionality.
