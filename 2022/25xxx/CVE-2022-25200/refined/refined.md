Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25200:

**CVE-2022-25200:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Checkmarx Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints. Also, these endpoints do not require POST requests, leading to CSRF.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** Multiple HTTP endpoints lack proper permission checks.
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through other methods, potentially leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks through HTTP requests.
    *   Exploitation of the missing permission check and lack of CSRF protection via crafted requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   Attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests.
    *   The attacker also needs to obtain a valid credentials ID through another method.

**Summary:**

The Checkmarx plugin is vulnerable to CSRF and a missing permission check, allowing an attacker with Overall/Read permissions to send crafted requests and capture credentials stored in Jenkins. There is no fix available as of the advisory's publication date.
