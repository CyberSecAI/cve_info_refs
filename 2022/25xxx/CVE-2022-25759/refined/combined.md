| Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Injection.

| Great find. Since we're now using cheerio to validate input, we should be able to easily strip the onload attribute. Are there any others that you think could be used to exploit in this way or any other nested elements within the SVG, other than the root that this needs to be applied to? |

## How to fix?

Upgrade `convert-svg-core` to version 0.6.2 or higher.

## Overview

[convert-svg-core](https://www.npmjs.org/package/convert-svg-core) is a package that supports converting SVG into another format using headless Chromium.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Injection via sending an `SVG` file containing the payload.

## PoC:

```
const { convert } = require('convert-svg-to-png');
const express = require('express');

const fileSvg = ``;
// YWxlcnQoMSk=
// function newContent(){document.open(),document.write('data'),document.close()}
const app = express();
app.get('/poc', async (req, res)=>{
try {
const png = await convert(fileSvg);
res.set('Content-Type', 'image/png');
res.send(png);
} catch (e) {

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.9 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
