Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-25759

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `convert-svg-core` package's processing of SVG files. The package uses Puppeteer/Chromium to render SVGs.  It does not properly sanitize the input SVG, allowing for the execution of Javascript code embedded within the SVG via the `onload` attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the library does not sanitize the SVG input and is therefore vulnerable to remote code injection. Specifically, the `onload` attribute is not stripped, which allows execution of JavaScript within the SVG.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can craft a malicious SVG file that, when processed, allows arbitrary file reading from the server's file system. The attacker can then use the `iframe` element to display the contents of these files.
- **Potential for further compromise:** Though not explicitly mentioned, Remote Code Execution (RCE) could potentially lead to broader system compromise beyond arbitrary file access, depending on the server configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG File:** An attacker provides a specially crafted SVG file with an `onload` attribute that contains malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to submit SVG file:** The attacker needs to be able to submit or cause the vulnerable application to process a malicious SVG file. This would depend on how the application uses the vulnerable `convert-svg-core` library.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes an SVG payload that uses `onload` to execute Javascript code to embed an `iframe` to display a local file from the server: `<svg onload=eval(atob(this.id)) id='ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUoJzxzdmctZHVtbXk+PC9zdmctZHVtbXk+PGlmcmFtZSBzcmM9ImZpbGU6Ly8vZXRjL3Bhc3N3ZCIgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwMHB4Ij48L2lmcmFtZT48c3ZnIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNDAgODAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjEwMDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PHRleHQgeD0iMCIgeT0iMCIgY2xhc3M9IlJycnJyIiBpZD0iZGVtbyI+ZGF0YTwvdGV4dD48L3N2Zz4nKTs='></svg>`.
- The javascript code is base64 encoded within the id attribute and decoded on load using `atob()`.
- The fix was to strip the `onload` attribute from the SVG input using `cheerio`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by `0xmanhnv`.
- The issue was fixed in version 0.6.2 of the `convert-svg-core` package.
- Snyk assigned a CVSS score of 9.9 (Critical) to this vulnerability.
