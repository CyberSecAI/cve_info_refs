{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input before displaying it in the /admin-panel1.php page, specifically the 'doctor' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the web admin's browser when they view the /admin-panel1.php page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious code via the 'doctor' parameter in the 'Add Doctor' page, which is then stored and later displayed on the /admin-panel1.php page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to add doctor information. They must also use Burp Suite (or similar tool) to intercept and modify the POST request, changing the 'doctor' parameter to the XSS payload. The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated as an admin to inject the payload; they can exploit the flaw in the 'Add Doctor' feature. The web admin must then view the vulnerable /admin-panel1.php page to trigger the XSS."
