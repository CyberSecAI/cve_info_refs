- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `saveParentControlInfo` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The function copies the `deviceId` parameter from an HTTP request into a heap buffer using `strcpy` without proper length validation. The `deviceId` parameter is attacker-controlled, making it vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploitation results in a denial of service (DoS) due to the heap overflow corrupting memory.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` page with an overly long `deviceId` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. This typically implies network access to the device, which could be from the local network or from the internet if the router's web interface is exposed.
