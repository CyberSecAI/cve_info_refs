Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-25183:

**CVE-2022-25183**

*   **Root Cause:** The Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin uses unsanitized Pipeline library names to create cache directories.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin fails to sanitize library names when creating cache directories. This allows for path traversal or similar issues through specially crafted library names.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins controller JVM by exploiting the lack of sanitization. This is achieved if a global Pipeline library configured to use caching already exists.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs Item/Configure permission within Jenkins.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious library name.
    *   A global Pipeline library using caching must be configured.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have `Item/Configure` permission in Jenkins and the ability to configure a global pipeline library to use caching.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory indicates that this vulnerability is fixed in version 561.va\_ce0de3c2d69 of the Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries plugin, which sanitizes library names when creating cache directories.
* The vulnerability is described as a "Sandbox bypass" because it allows the attacker to execute code outside of the intended sandbox environment.
