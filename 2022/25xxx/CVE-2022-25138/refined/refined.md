Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Axelor web application. Specifically, user-provided inputs are not being correctly validated or escaped before being rendered in the application's pages. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of stored XSS vulnerabilities were found in various parts of the application. This means that the malicious scripts are permanently stored in the application's database and are executed whenever a user views the affected pages.
- **Unrestricted SVG Upload:** The application allows the upload of SVG files without proper sanitization. SVG files can contain embedded JavaScript, leading to XSS when the SVG is rendered by the browser.
- **Base64 Encoded SVG XSS**: Uploaded images can be opened in a new page as base64 encoded data, leading to the execution of XSS when a malicious SVG is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Data theft:** This could be used to steal session cookies, tokens, or other sensitive user data.
- **Account takeover:** Attackers could potentially hijack user accounts.
- **Malware distribution:** By redirecting the victim to external sites or downloading payloads.
- **Defacement:** The malicious JavaScript could be used to modify the appearance of the web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Fields:** Injecting JavaScript payloads into input fields like name, title, login (code parameter), and other similar fields.
- **SVG Uploads:** Uploading maliciously crafted SVG files via profile picture upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application to inject the malicious code into vulnerable input fields.
- No special permissions are explicitly mentioned, but the ability to create/modify records and upload files within the application are required.

**More detail than the official CVE description:**
Yes, the provided content gives specific examples of vulnerable parameters, like the 'name' parameter when creating a task or a user. It also provides concrete examples of payloads. It also includes a description of SVG-based XSS.

**Specific Technical Details:**
- The common payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability is `<img/src/onerror=prompt(1)>`.
- The XSS is triggered when the injected input is reflected back in a page view, leading to JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
- The issue was reported in Axelor versions prior to 5.4.11.
- Mitigation included input sanitization, whitelisting/blacklisting file names and content-types.
