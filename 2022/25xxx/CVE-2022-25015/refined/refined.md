The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the IceHRM application.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user input when the `content` parameter is set to `HTML`. Specifically, a user can set their 'first name' to any unsanitized HTML or script, which is then stored in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A less privileged user can inject malicious JavaScript code into the database. When other users, including administrators, view the affected data (e.g., in the 'System > Users' page), the injected script executes in their browsers. This can lead to account takeover through cookie stealing. The attacker can potentially steal the session cookie of an administrator, gaining full access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to update the 'first name' field of a user profile. The malicious payload is embedded within the `first_name` parameter, with the `content` parameter set to `HTML` to bypass sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the IceHRM application. The attacker does not require any special privileges other than the ability to modify their own user profile. They must have the ability to send HTTP requests with a modified `content` parameter set to `HTML`.
