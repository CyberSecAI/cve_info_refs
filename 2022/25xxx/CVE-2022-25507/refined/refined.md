{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The FreeTAKServer-UI does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the Callsign parameter when creating or viewing Emergency Alerts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when viewing an emergency alert. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web Interface: An attacker can inject a malicious script directly through the callsign parameter when creating an Emergency Alert in the web UI.",
       "End User Device: An attacker can inject a malicious script through the callsign parameter when creating an Emergency Alert from an end user device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create emergency alerts. This can be done either through the web UI directly or through the end user device. In the latter case, an attacker could obtain a RestAPI key from a leaked API response to escalate privileges"
