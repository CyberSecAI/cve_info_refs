| In the FreeTAKServer-UI there is a function to create and view Emergency Alerts that are originating from either the End User Device or from the UI itself. Both Avenues are susceptible to a Stored Cross Site scripting vulnerability in the Callsign parameter. Web Interface In the case of a XSS in the WebUI it is as simple as having a callsign with the payload of `<img src onerror=alert(/payload/)>` which will trigger the Emergency function and display the emergency in the WebUI.
