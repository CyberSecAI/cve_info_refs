Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure page caching in Internet Explorer, which allows the interpolation of `<textarea>` elements, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-controlled input when rendering pages in Internet Explorer, specifically when handling `<textarea>` elements. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can steal cookies, potentially hijacking user sessions.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack user sessions, gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Attackers could expose sensitive information.
*   **Access to Privileged Services/Functionality:** Attackers could gain access to privileged services and functionalities.
*   **Malware Delivery:** Attackers could deliver malware to users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   The attack requires user interaction. A user must take some action for the exploit to work (e.g., clicking a malicious link).
*   Specific attack types include stored, reflected, DOM-based, and mutated XSS.
    *   **Stored XSS:** Malicious code is inserted into the application (e.g., via a link) and executed when a user interacts with the injected code.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked, sends malicious code to the vulnerable web site, which is then reflected back to the user's browser.
    *   **DOM-based XSS:** The attacker manipulates the client's browser to render a malicious page, with the malicious data being embedded directly within the page's structure.
    *    **Mutated XSS**:  The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser during markup parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any prior access to the system to carry out the attack.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious input that will be processed by a vulnerable application, targeting a user using Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple packages related to Angular, including `org.webjars.npm:angular`, `org.webjars.bowergithub.angular:angular`, `angular`, and `org.webjars.bower:angular`.
*   There are no fixed versions available for the vulnerable packages.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*  **CVSS v3.1 Score:** Snyk: 4.2 (Medium), NVD: 6.1 (Medium)
* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** High
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None
* **User Interaction (UI):** Required
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged
* **Confidentiality (C):** Low
