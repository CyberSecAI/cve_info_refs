There is one new control panel function, some non-critical bug fixes and some refinements. Unless you have been having cookie problems it is really not necessary to upgrade from 5.47b to 5.47c.   * Removed   extraneous data from hacklog. * Added   a "Forgot your password" link to the login page for private forums. * Added   a new function to the control panel, under miscellaneous and/or   debugging---a quick method to delete custom forum styles. * Added   'pruning' to admin logging function. * Fixed   a typo in the display when rebuilding members' list. * Fixed   the archive multipage bug when moving threads into archives. * Keyed   default days prune option in preferences to the board default.   Previously this was hard coded to 10 days. * Simplified cookie pathing to comply with a larger variety of domain   names. If you change your cookie path, your users will have to   reset their preferences. * Changed   the cookie clear function in preferences to clear cookies regardless   of path option.  Version 5.47b - November 28, 2000 A minor update involving the majority of the cgi files and controlpanel.html in the non-cgi directory. While there are no new functions in 5.47b, there are many code optimizations and some bug fixes.   * A   reply with quote vulnerability related to viewing private forums   when you had no access has been fixed. * Filtered   more NT script possibilities. All profile fields now filtered. * Fixed   the ability to choose an illegal password on edit profile. * Changed   the smiley count limiting regex to one that will be easier on   a server. * Fixed   typo in error message when creating a moderator with a username   that does not exist. * Optimized   the entire user information and permissions coding. Uses a lot   less server resources now. In addition, the search options are   arranged somewhat differently. * Extra   space added to the top of a list using [list]. * Fixed a bug in the ubbcode URL code. * Cookies   are now rooted differently. Cookies in control panel now also   change with the cookie rooting. Notice! This may require your   users to clear their cookies using the clear cookies link in preferences   and then reset them. * Made   some minor font nesting changes to better comply with Netscape   6. * For   all versions, changed the UBB Members area link in the version   check to the correct URL.  Version 5.47a - October 26, 2000 This is a minor update involving ubbmisc.cgi, ubb\_library.pl and controlpanel.html There is no new fuctionality in 5.47a.   * Added   more filters to prevent users from registering and running harmful   scripts on UNIX based servers ( 5.47a simply has the same thoughts   extended to NT servers). * Fixed   a small bug in mail-to UBBCode.  Version 5.47 - October 9, 2000 A major upgrade involving changes to postings.cgi, cpanel2.cgi, cpanel4.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, and ubb\_library.pl. There is also one new directory within the non-cgi directory and numerous new files withing the cgi directory.   * Added   the SpellChecker.net module with on/off in the control panel.   This is the banner ad version; bannerless can be purchased via   upgrade from http://www.spellchecker.net. * Fixed   Admin logging; when it is turned off it *is* off. * Fixed   the search for all users with private forum access. * Added   multipage links to forumdisplay.cgi so that if a thread spans   more then one page each page can be jumped to individually. * Added   more code cleanup and enhancements to forumdisplay.cgi. It will   not be any faster but will be less memory intensive. * Added   minor bug fixes and some cleanup to the recount threads routines   in ubb\_library.pl  Version 5.46a - September 27, 2000 A minor bug fix update effecting postings.cgi, ubbmisc.cgi, cpanel4.cgi, and both ubb\_library files.   * Fixed   the infamous uncapitalized "if" on the registration page. * Fixed   the spacing after "From:" in Author Extra. * Returns   more verbose messages on max memfields errors - now reports which   member has the extra field. * Changed   the display of || in messages, no longer add the extra space between   them. * Banned   registration of names beginning #!. In extremely rare instances   this could have been used to run non-UBB commands. * Banned   the use of certain characters for unregistered user's usernames,   which might corrupt data files.  Version 5.46 - August 28, 2000 A major release involving most every cgi file and many non-cgi files. Specific changes include:   * Massive   speedup in "getusernumber" subroutine in any UBB functions   that uses it (posting, update threads). * File   locking has been fixed. * Added   ability to reset thread counts and post times on a per-forum basis. * Cleaned   up the signature censor checking routine. * Improved   error checking to ensure that forums are created properly when   trying to create multiple new forums. * Much   more efficient parsing for UBBCode (does not attempt to parse   UBBCode if there is none contained within the post). * Password   box in private protected forums no longer appears if you don't   have a password set. * Announcement   start date has been fixed. * Contact   us link can be a URL instead of a mailto link. * Moderator   column on first page can be turned off. * COPPA   deny feature - will not accept registrations for anyone under   13. * A   bug in the IP ban list has been fixed. * Numerous   typos have been corrected. * Registration   e-mail box automatically fills contact e-mail address if left   blank (for COPPA). * You   can no longer turn "categories only" on if you do not   have categories. * More   efficient and accurate display of member total on first page. * Added   new "How Do I" into control panel as well as additional   help links.  Version 5.45c - April 17, 2000 A minor release which blocks a misuse of 'Moderate Registrations'. There is now a COPPA option to show only the printable permission form and a problem with images in signatures has been fixed. Files affected: cpanel4.cgi, cpanel2.cgi, register\_lib.pl ubbmisc.cgi, ubb\_library.pl. Version 5.45b - April 07, 2000 A minor release which corrects a 'registration notification' problem in some configurations. Copyright 'powered by' links now match other copyright text. Excess smilies are blocked in edit and the meta-refresh rate for reply & edit has been lengthened. A hacking error for oversized member files has been expanded and multiple small layout changes apply a more consistent UBB style across sub pages. Only script files are affected. Version 5.45a - April 04, 2000 A minor release which corrects some typos and a missing password problem when 'E-mail verification' is Combined with 'Membership Moderation. Affected files: forumdisplay.cgi, cpanel4.cgi, cpanel2.cgi and ubbmisc.cgi. Version 5.45 - April 02, 2000 A major release affecting all scripts. Most changes involve adding features to help your UBB comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act becoming Law April 21, 2000. Included are Age Check, Privacy Link, Membership Moderation, Administrative Notification of Registrations and a Recent Registrations Search. These are control panel options. Other options include 'Reply with Quote', UBB Images in Signatures, and a Custom 'Board Closed' Message. Several layout adjustments improve UBB display. The Styles pages now include color swatches and there is a more literal quoting of header and footer information. The UBB copyright notice is selectable as either an image or regular text link. Editing cplinks now requires only one BASE URL and MSIE 5 users can use a custom icon in Favorites. Version 5.44b - March 12, 2000 A minor release correcting some typos. cpanel2.cgi now blocks the ability of malicious users to browse member names or hijack basic UBB variables. ubb\_library2.pl now automatically cleans up all leftover 'dailyindex' files to prevent clutter. Versions 5.43 or later require only the replacement of the script files. There were no changes to NonCGI files. Version 5.44a - February 23, 2000 A minor upgrade correcting a display problem for archives and adding a filter for unclosed HTML tags in profile fields. There were minor adjustments of the new security filter to optimize performance. Changes affect ubb\_library.pl. ubb\_library2.pl, postings.cgi and edit.cgi. There were minor typographical changes in most other scripts. There were no NonCGI file changes.Version 5.44 - February 18, 2000 An important upgrade affecting most scripts to block recently reported security exploits, consolidates cookies routines in one library for efficiency, adds code to prevent HTML code in profile fields and corrects a private forum editing problem. The most obvious change will be more detailed error messages when UBB encounters a permissions or paths problem. We do recommend that all users upgrade to this version.Version 5.43d - February 3, 2000 A very minor upgrade that adds some more cookie refinement (we finally tracked down the problem some browsers were experiencing with cookies after changing preferences), improves table layout of forums summary page, and improves preference settings page.Version 5.43c - January 31, 2000 A very minor upgrade that adds some cookie refinement for Netcape users (some Netscape versions were reporting difficulties... no bug discovered, but we refined the code a bit in a couple of spots, hoping that will improve things for these users); fixes a Delete Topic bug, and parses HackCheck differently. Affected ubbmisc.cgi, postings.cgi, cpanel.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, and ubb\_library2.pl.Version 5.43b - January 24, 2000 A very minor upgrade that adds some URL hard-coding for those of you that use BASE HREF codes and adds some centering tags to the search results page. Also fixed a VerifyID bug in ubbmisc.cgi.Version 5.43a - January 21, 2000 A minor upgrade, affecting cpanel2.cgi, cpanel.cgi, postings.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, archive.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, and cpanel3.cgi.   * Fixed   a bug affecting the moving of topic from a private forum (max   security), when moved topic is to remain in previous forum as   well. Moved topics were not being properly closed in the private   forums.* Fixed     bug affecting posting to private forums when a forum password     was being used.* Fixed       Update Threads continuation problem experienced by some users       (was cookie-related).* Improved         user permissions search routine processing.  Version 5.43 - January 18, 2000 A minor upgrade, but with a number of code improvements to enhance overall security... includes one new feature- a new option in the General Settings area of the control panel that allows admin's to remove the requirement that all topic subjects contain at least one English letter or number (non English sites will appreciate this new option). Affected nearly every CGI file.   * Bug   fixes: Euro 24 HR time bug; disable smilies bug when editing;   modify bio e-mail ban bug; unregistered user "profile" info bug.* Added     alternating colors to the topic review section, as well.* Added       escaped escapes support for Headers/Footers.  Version 5.42a - January 5, 2000 A minor upgrade, fixing a style settings bug from 5.42 and adding some code improvement to forumdisplay.cgi. Affected cpanel.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, and ubb\_library.pl.   * In   5.42, some extraneous code was added that negatively affected   the Style Settings area of the control panel. Basically, some   "bgcolor=" lines were added to certain font color fields. Those   are not supposed to be there! This was fixed in 5.42a. If you   set color with "bgcolor=" in the field, simply remove the "bgcolor="   wording in any fields that they appear after you upgrade.* Added     some extra hot topic folder readings, even if cookies are off.  Version 5.42/5.41b - January 1, 2000 A very minor upgrade, affecting several CGI files.   * Added   code that automatically adjusted postings for users who failed   to upgrade to a Y2K-compliant version prior to Jan 1. In other   words, if you wait(ed) to upgrade until after Y2K, this version   will automatically fix the posts that were not Y2K-compliant and   fix any associated date-related problems. If you fall into this   category, be sure to reset general settings, re-index, and Update   Threads!* Fixed     javascript bug affected Netscape users only. Did not affect IE     users.* Fixed       a display bug in the Socket mail routine related to Y2k.* Note that all international editions of the UBB were also updated         for these fixes (though their version numbers were not changed).  Version 5.41a - December 20, 1999 A very minor upgrade, affecting cpanel.cgi, cpanel2.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, and postings.cgi.   * Fixed   bug in Reply With Quote feature affecting multi-page topics.* Fixed     bug affecting subjects that contained < and > characters.* Fixed       some typos in the control panel.  Version 5.41 - December 18, 1999 A relatively major release, adding several new features, affecting most CGI files and adding several new files.   * Added   new author column display options. See General Settings for these   options.* Added     Reply With Quote feature (note: new quote.gif graphic added).* Added       URL to your UBB in body of e-mail text sent to newly registered       users (when e-mail verification is enabled).* Added         Flood Check feature (courtesy Michael Farris), which prevents         users from flooding your board with posts. This is an optional         feature set in the General Settings. You can also configure the         time span between allowed posts. Admins and moderators are exempt         from floodchecking.* Improved           signature field, to remove any trailing spaces.* Fixed             registration with number 0 bug.* Improved               Registration Suspension to prevent bypasses.* Added                 "Disable Smilies" option for each post made.* Added                   new smilies.html page (new file), which summarizes all allowed                   smilies and is linked from each pst page.* Added                     6 new smilies (6 new graphics in the ZIP).* Added                       Hot Topic option. You can now indicate particularly active topics                       with a unique icon. Two new icons added- hotclosed.gif and hotclosedb.gif.                       This feature can be disabled in your UBB General Settings.  Version 5.40 - November 15, 1999 A minor release, improving a few internal processes, adding some new diagnostic features. Affected: postings.cgi, ubbmisc.cgi, cpanel.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, ub\_library2.pl, cplinks.html, forumdisplay.cgi, and added cpanel4.cgi (new file).   * Improved   e-mail reply notification so that the link listed in the e-mail   take the users directly to the topic, not just the overall forum.* Enhanced     security around e-mail features.* Added       additional code checking to posting fields.* Removed         ability of a moderator to access private forums for which they         are not a moderator. (Previously, moderators could enter any private         forum, if they were not a moderator in a particular private forum.)* Added           new control panel area: Miscellaneous/Debugging Options. This           area will be used for various utilities designed to either enhance           or streamline your UBB. Currently, there are two options in this           new section: a) Delete Old HTML files (HTML files left over from           previously deleted multi-HTML pages will be removed from your           system); b) Rebuild Member Files (if you think your members files           are not accurately logged, try this to resolve the problem.)  Version 5.39c - October 7, 1999 A very minor release, fixing a few small bugs from 5.39b, affecting ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, ubbmisc.cgi, postings.cgi, search.cgi, and cpanel3.cgi.   * Fixed   bug affecting forum descriptions-- quotation marks were being   improperly escaped.* Added     additional space check for registered names.* Fixed       Category-Only display bug.* Fixed         bug affecting display of Topic Review in Private Forums (affected         Netscape browsers only).* Fixed           bug affecting searches of usernames with spaces (only certain           search configurations were affected).  Version 5.39b - 9/23/99 A very minor release, fixing a few small bugs from 5.39a, affecting ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, ubbmail.cgi, postings.cgi, archive.cgi, and cpanel3.cgi.   * Fixed   edit-mode bug affecting CODE and QUOTE tag conversion.* Fixed     typos in postings.cgi and archive.cgi.* Fixed       bug affecting entry to the Digest Area of the control panel- moderators       were not being allowed access.* Fixed         "%" bug in Forum Styles area. Percentage marks were         being stripped out.  Version 5.39a - 9/14/99 A very minor release, fixing a few small bugs from 5.39, affecting ubb\_library.pl, ubbmisc.cgi, postings.cgi, ubbcode.html, and faq.html.   * Fixed   forum doubling bug some users experienced. Note that this release   does not fix a prior forum doubling problem, but prevents it from   happening again. If you installed 5.39 and had a forum doubling   problem, e-mail us for assistance at [support@infopop.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207100935/mailto%3Asupport%40infopop.com).* Fixed     some typos in ubbmisc.cgi, ubbcode.html and faq.html.* Fixed       Hop To bug affecting Netscape browsers.* Added         check to Subject to require at least one alphanumeric character.  Version 5.39 - 9/11/99 A major release, affecting nearly every UBB CGI file, as well as ubbcode.html, controlpanel.html, and faq.html. Here are the primary new features/changes in 5.39. Important: be sure to reset our Forum Settings if upgrading to 5.39 because the forum setting is completely different.   * Multiple   Moderators: you can now set up to 4 moderators per forum.* Improved     Forum Settings area: that area is now much easier to navigate.* Forum/Category       Ordering: you can now order your forums and/or categories in any       way you like (in the Forum Settings area of your control panel).* Forum         Styles: you can now set unique styles (fonts, colors, graphics)         for each forum, if you like. You can also set a unique header         and footer for each forum, as well. Note that if you want to use         the default Header and Footer, you should leave the Custom Header         and Footer fields BLANK in the Forum Details area.* Improved           SMTP code for all e-mail features.* Disallowed             <SCRIPT> tags in forums that allow HTML.* Improved               topic review section on "post reply" pages.* Improved                 indexing/search, providing more options for the admin. in terms                 of the manner in which the search index is stored. Also added                 new option that allow you to disable searched of ALL forums (while                 still allowing searches for individual forums).* Added                   smart linking on search link, associating the forum to be searched                   with the forum where the user clicked the link.* Improved                     Edit/Prune areas of control panel- these changes will not be obvious                     from a cosmetic viewpoint (the changes were internal but should                     improve overall processing speed in that area).* Fixed                       UBB Code URL bug.* Added                         moderator access to the Index area of the control panel- important                         because the UBB will not automatically re-index after every edit/prune                         now (to conserve resources and improve processing speed).* Added                           ability to Update Threads in a specific forum only.* Other                             smaller cosmetic and technical changes...  Version 5.38d - 7/22/99 A minor release, affecting ubb\_library.pl, postings.cgi, search.cgi, Ultimate.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, and ubbmisc.cgi.   * Fixed   problem with new icon association feature that affected editing   of posts with icons. The icons were not being maintained properly.   This release fixes that display problem.* Revised     search routine slightly so that a search of all forums will actually     cycle through each forum on screen. This will mean a slower search     system, but for large forums, it will result in fewer server time-outs.     It will be slower only because the UBB will pause between each     forum it searches through to decrease server demands.* Modified       announcement display to adjust for announcements created in a       previous year (previously, this could affect the order of display).  Version 5.38c - 7/13/99 A minor release, affecting most files, but mostly for things like the corporate name change.   * Replaced   previous 14 icons with a new batch.* Cosmetic     fix- announcement date of 2000 was showing as 1900. This was not     a Y2K issue and did not affect any processing. Strictly a display     error within the announcement display.* Cosmetic       fix- the moderator notification e-mail was not showing proper       return URL for forums set for maximum security.* Changed         our corporate name listing (we recently changed our name from         Madrona Park, Inc. to Infopop Corporation).  Version 5.38b - 6/23/99 A minor bug fix affecting postings.cgi, and ubb\_library.pl.   * Fixed   a bug related to the new maximum image per post rule. This bug   only seems to affect some versions of Perl- nearly everyone will   not have a problem, but it is now corrected for all Perl versions.  Version 5.38a - 6/23/99 A minor bug fix affecting cpanel2.cgi, ubb\_library.pl and ubb\_library2.pl.   * Fixed   a bug related to upgrading from versions before 5.25 to 5.38.   Topic files were not being changed to the proper name format.* Fixed     Edit Option Toggle in control panel- it works fine, but the toggle     would always display selection properly.  Version 5.38 - 6/21/99 A significant upgrade affecting most of the UBB CGI files, as well as faq.html, cplinks.html, and ubbcode.html.   * Added   an IP Ban capability. IP numbers added to the ban list will be   prevented from registering and posting. You set this in the new   Ban List section of your control panel (be sure to upload the   latest version of cplinks.html!).* HTML     Page Split Option. Now you can set your UBB so that it automatically     breaks up topic pages into separate pages, based on the number     of posts per topic. You can also keep your UBB so that it does     not split the topic pages, if you prefer. You set this in your     General Settings area of your control panel.* Icon       Association: Thanks to Kombat03 for the icon idea! Basically,       you can associate an icon with each post. Be sure to add a subdirectory       called "icons" (lowercase) in your UBB NON CGI directory.       There are 14 standard icons (included in the UBB zipfile and also       courtesy Kombat03), but you may also replace these with your own,       add new ones, or remove some of them. Just make sure any icons       you want to use are saved as gifs with a name in the format: iconX.gif       (with X being the icon number- any number between 1 and 99). You       activate the icon option in the General Settings. Again, thanks       to Kombat03 for developing the concept and supplying the graphics!* Added         new UBB Code: [LIST] - used for generating bulleted lists in your         posts. See the new ubbcode.html file in 5.38 for details on LIST.* Placed           the Footer variable at the true bottom of each page.* Added             new option in the transfer post feature. Previously, if you wanted             to transfer a post from one forum to another, the post would automatically             be deleted from the previous forum it was in. Now, you also have             the option of keeping the post in the old forum, but it will be             closed in the old forum, with a note stating where it was transferred.* Added               a new Close Registration option in General Settings, allowing               you to prevent any new registrations.* Added                 a new option in General Settings for determining how Cookies are                 set. If you are running more than one UBB on a domain, you should                 choose the "specific directory" option; otherwise, choose                 the "broad" setting.* Added                   an internal loop rate in the search routine which cycles through                   index files in batches of 10,000 posts to improve performance.                   Also, search results are stored on your server for up to 4 hours,                   in essence caching those results if a user goes back to them or                   if the search results are extensive- this will improve performance.* Improved                     indexing- eliminating certain common words from the index, removing                     all spaces, and truncating indexed messages to no more than 210                     characters. This will reduce index sizes.* Added                       an option to remove the search option from your UBB.* Changed                         the way the reply form is displayed. Previously, a summary of                         the topic being replied to was included at the bottom of the reply                         form. This was rather inefficient, however, especially for very                         long topics. Thus, we have replaced that with a simple link to                         the topic, so it can be reviewed if necessary. Those users using                         Internet Explorer can also have the option of viewing the topic                         in an inline frame on the reply page (the inline frame option                         is configurable in the General Settings).  Version 5.37 - 6/8/99 A minor upgrade and bug fix, affecting cpanel.cgi, cpanel2.cgi, cpanel3.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, ubb\_libraray.pl, postings.cgi, and ubb\_library2.pl (all that is changed in ubb\_library.pl is the version number, however).   * Added   admin. toggle to allow admins to determine whether they want to   allow users to delete their own posts.* Bug     Fix: viewing advanced permissions settings for users in the control     panel. The display was faulty.* Bug       Fix: Auto URL- was not reading tildes properly.* Fixed         typo on "Process Complete" page.* Bug           Fix: affected HTML in archive descriptions.  Version 5.36a - 6/7/99 A minor bug fix, affecting cpanel3.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi and ubb\_library.pl (all that is changed in ubb\_library.pl is the version number, however). The bug affected the Forum Settings area, after setting one block of 10 forums, the "additional forums" button would take you back to the set of forums just set, rather than to the next set. This button has been fixed! Also, a bug affecting the display of CERTAIN forums was fixed. If you have a problem displaying forums (error that they do not exist, make sure you upgrade to 5.36a). Version 5.36 - 6/7/99 A major upgrade, affecting every UBB CGI file and a few NonCGI files. Here's a run-down on what was added:   * Option   to remove all registration links/references* Improved     search index- split up per forum* Archives       (read-only sections where you can move topics)* Ability         to move a topic from one forum to another* New           Topic View option: "view all topics from inception"* Ability             to delete posts from the topic page itself* Ability               to reopen previously closed topics* New                 CategoryStripTextColor style setting* Improved                   control panel layouts* Improved                     censor* Auto-linking                       of URLs (no UBB Code required)* New                         [url] option that allows more flexible hyperlinking* Ability                           of Admins/Moderators to View IP numbers from the topic page (if                           IP log, but not display is set).* Option                             to Delete all cookies set by the UBB* Improved                               cookie setting by path- useful if you are running more than one                               UBB on the same domain* Added                                 target=\_blank to hyperlink to your homepage (useful for sites                                 that place the UBB in frames)* Improved                                   "Today's Active Topics" feature- much quicker processing.* Added                                     Header Insert variable to general settings area of control panel.                                     This allows you to add your own custom code that will be inserted                                     between the <HEAD> and </HEAD> tags on each UBB page.                                     Useful for adding basic style sheet coding and additional META                                     tags.  Version 5.35 - 4/18/99 A minor upgrade- affected cpanel.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, and ubb\_library2.pl.   * Added   support for assigning individual user access permissions for posting   to forums that have posting restrictions in place. (Only completely   private forums were previously allowed to have individual permissions   assigned).  Version 5.34a - 4/14/99 A minor adjustment. Previously, if you set a forum so that only moderators or admins could post topics and/or replies in a given forum, if you left your forum password blank (in your forum settings) then someone besides an admin. or moderator could post to the forum. This release closes that loophole. Affected postings.cgi, ubb\_library.pl and ubb\_library2.pl. Version 5.34 - 4/12/99 A bux fix- affected ubbmisc.cgi, cpanel.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, and postings.cgi.   * Bug   fixed: the lost password feature was not finding registered users   properly. Thanks to Troy at Warner Brothers for spotting the bug!* Bug     fixed: when editing messages, any UBB Code used was not being     properly back to UBB Code.  Version 5.33 - 4/8/99 A minor upgrade, but it includes a slight change to the member files formats, so be sure to reset general variables (as usual) when you upgrade. When resetting general variables, the UBB will make necessary changes to your member files to improve performance- do not interrupt that process!   * Added   new check in the Profile Change area. Now, if a user does not   have permission to post notes, he will not be able to change his   e-mail address in the profile change area.* Changed     member formatting slightly- broke up the memberslist.cgi file     into two separate files for speedier processing and to reduce     possibility of file corruption's. A new file will be created in     your members directory (called emailfile.cgi). You do not add     this file- the UBB does it for you when you reset general variables.* Added       code to make sure that those using Netscape browsers will not       see table fields filled with whatever table border color you set       if no posts have been made to a forum or if no moderator has been       set.  Version 5.32 - 4/1/99 April Fools Day- don't worry, there are no gags enclosed with this release. This is a combination bug fix and minor upgrade. Affected cpanel2.cgi, ubbmisc.cgi, postings.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, cpanel.cgi.   * Fixed a   bug related to setting moderators. This was a hit or miss bug   that did not affect all UBBs. Be sure to reset your moderators   after upgrading, if you had a problem keeping moderator settings   previously.* Added a     duplicate email check in the "lost password" email feature.     This was added because some UBBers were leaving the Unique Email     option turned off, which means that you can have duplicate email     addresses (you don't want someone else's registration info sent     to the wronog party). Basically, if the UBB finds more than one     instance of an email address that is requested in the lost password     feature, it will not send any info to the user (for maximum safety).* Added the       user registration number to the listings in the User Permissions       area of the control panel (makes it easier to find a particular       record if you have to look something up manually).  Version 5.31 - 3/22/99 A bug fix.   * Fixed a   bug related to posting in forums that allow unregistered users   to post messages. 5.30 was not allowing these unregistered users   to post.* Fixed a     bug affecting forum display is you set the topic display to no     limit in general variables.* Fixed bug       affecting sending digests since last digest sent. Digests were       being sent that included all posts over past 31 days, rather than       since last digest was sent.* Fixed forwarding         bug when replying in a private forum with minimum security setting.  Version 5.30a - 3/21/99 A minor upgrade.   * Added a   1-day option to the send digest feature.* Fixed a     small bug relatd to names that appear in digests sent.  Version 5.30 - 3/17/99 A significant upgrade. Note that you MUST update all variables: general variables, style variables, all forum variables and then Update Threads when upgrading!   * Added maximum   security option for private forums. Setting private forums under   maximum security option forces all private forums to be displayed   dynamically (thus, ensuring user validation prior to viewing of   posts). From a technical standpoint, private forum iwth maximum   security turned on have their topic pages stored in .cgi files,   rather than .html files.* Changed     extension used on topic files from .ubb to .cgi for added security.     (You need to Update Threads to ensure that this conversion occurs).* Added Digest       feature, which allows you to mail digests of a particular forum       in your UBB to a subscriber list. Includes a built-in subscriber       feature (a subscribe link will appear on your UBB front page if       you have created any digests). Users can subscribe and unsubscribe       from your UBB. This is not an automatic digest, meaning that if       you want to send a digest, you must go into your control panel       and request that a digest be sent to your subscriber list.* Added code         to support Microsoft SMTP server on IIS.* Added option           to display alternate user titles (to substitute for the default           Administrator, Moderator, Member, and Junior Members).* Added increased             flexibility in determining who can post new topics and replies,             including the option to not allow replies in a given forum.* Improved               layout of topic and reply forms to match tabel layout used throughout               rest of UBB.* Fixed a                 couple of small bugs affecting editing messages that contain special                 characters (control panel edit only).* Added Forum                   Password option, to allow dispensing of a forum password to a                   group of users, rather than having to individually set permissions                   for each user. You may still set individual forum permissions                   for each user, however.* Added option                     to limit the number of topics displayed in a forum per page- useful                     for very active sites (set in the general variables section of                     control panel).  Version 5.29b - 3/4/99 A very minor bug fix.   * Fixed a   bug affecting editing of messages in private forums. (Only affected   private forums). Affected postings.cgi.  Version 5.29a - 2/26/99 A very minor bug fix. If you already have 5.29 and are not experiencing any problems related to what is described below, there is no need for you to upgrade.   * Fixed a   radio button display problem affected some forum variable pages.   This bug did not affect any actual functions, but on some web   servers, the radio buttons would not display properly.* Fixed another     small bug in the announcements area that could affect editing     of annoucements (again, only on some web servers).  Version 5.29 - 2/20/99 A minor but fairly important bug fix that affected: edit.cgi and cpanel.cgi.   * Added some   additional checks in the edit routines to prevent some dupicating   within certain ubb threads.  Version 5.28 - 2/19/99 A minor upgrade/bug fix that affected: cplinks.html, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, ubbmail.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, forumterms.html, edit.cgi, ubbmisc.cgi, cpanel2.cgi, postings.cgi, cpanel.cgi, ubbcode.html, and cpanel3.cgi.   * Added a   Cycle Rate variable to the Update Threads control panel function.   This will give admins greater control over the Thread Updating   process. Depending on the speed/power of your server and the number   of messages you store, you may want to adjust the Cycle Rate (the   maximum number of threads processed per block).* Fixed unique     email option bug.* Fixed bug       affecting updatin of last post times when pruning messages.* Added checks         to prevent truncating of forum threads files in case of server         timeouts, etc.* Added new           version checker that will mean that you do not have to re-upload           the cplinks.html file every time you upgrade.  Version 5.27 - 2/16/99 A minor upgrade/bug fix that affected: cplinks.html, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, ubbmail.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, forumterms.html, edit.cgi, ubbmisc.cgi, cpanel2.cgi, and cpanel3.cgi.   * Added a   cycle-through effect when resetting forum last post times and   thread files (the checkbox option in the general variables section).   This will allow large sites to reset all forum data, if necessary,   much easier.* Fixed a     bug affecting usernames with plus signs... they were not able     to post messages before.* Added category       display within "Hop To" menus, for forums that have       category display activated.* Added email         validation to "Mail Users" area which checks to make         sure that each email is in a vaild format before sending it.  Version 5.26 - 2/14/99 A minor upgrade/bug fix that affected only: faq.html, cplinks.html, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, ubbmisc.cgi, cpanel2.cgi, and cpanel3.cgi.   * Corrected   Private Forum bug- in 5.25, you were unable to convert an old   forum (pre-5.25) to private properly because a private ofrum directory   would ot be created, if you had previously assigned a forum password   to that forum. This has been corrected so that you can change   these old forums with passwords to private forums.* Fixed bug     that affected viewing of user profiles- user names that contained     spaces were not formatted properly to do messages search using     link in profile.* Added code       to send old members formatted in pre-5.25 style into an archive       directory... as a precaution in case problems occur in member       conversion process. This feature may not work in all NT platforms,       but it strictly a precautionary addition.* Fixed username         with space problem for initial login opon upgrade from a version         before 5.25 to one after 5.25.* Fixed bug           affecting resetting of last post times (using new check box on           general variables page)- last post time was not always retrieving           the last post time (only affected the overall general variables           checkbox resetting, not last post setting used in UBB elsewhere).  Version 5.25 - 2/10/99 A major upgrade, affecting nearly every CGI file and a few of the NON CGI files, with several new files added (including ubbmail.cgi).  New in 5.25:   * New format   for storage of Member records. Old member files are automatically   converted to the new format when you upgrade to 5.25. This new   format allows non alphanumeric characters in user names (useful   for non English names).* Email Ban     List added: you can ban whole domains (all hotmail emails, for     example) or specific emails (example@thisdomain.com).* UBB On/Off       switch added- useful for when you upgrade your UBB. You can now       turn your UBB off while you are upgrading or performing maintenance.       Visitors receive a notice that your UBB is temporarily down when       UBB is off.* UBBFriend         feature added. Allows visitors to email a recommended topic page         to a friend.* IP Log/Display:           allows you to log and/or display IP numbers for all posted messages.* Adjusted             User Permissions area of control panel so that records are returned             in maximum groups of 50 at a time.* Added Prune               By User option to control panel- useful for pruning all posts               by a particular user in one or all forums.* New Posting                 Restriction options- new settings allow for greater flexibility                 in posting permissions. For instance, you can now designate a                 forum so that only admins and moderators can post new topics,                 while anyone can reply.* Private                   Forum Option- now you may designate a forum as completely private,                   meaning that its topics may not be read or posted to by anyon                   other than admins, moderators, and users you have given express                   permission to do so. You grant user's permission to access private                   forums through the User Permission are of the control panel.* Added Anonymous                     Posting Option- now you can allow non registered visitors to post                     notes in a forum, if you desire. Set this option in the Forum                     Variables section of your control panel.* Reverse                       Thread Option- now you can have posts in a topic displayed newest                       to oldest, rather that the default oldest to newest. Set this                       in the general variable section of the control panel.* Added censor                         check to usernames* Added email                           validation to registration* Added check                             to ensure that unregistered users posting on forums that allow                             unregistered postings do not use names already reserved by registered                             users* Daily Active                               Topic List added to opening page- displays topics in all open                               (non private) forums that have been posted to that day.* Added "search                                 All Posts By User" link to profile view* Added table                                   border color option and active link color to Styles variables* Added new                                     UBB Code called [code]* Added means                                       to navigate to next and previous topic threads from topic pages                                       themselves.* Added private                                         forums search* Added message                                           to the email received by moderators when moderator notify is turned                                           on* Added Mail                                             Users option to control panel- way to email all registered users                                             in forum (except those that do not want to receive such mailings).* Other smaller                                               changes...  Version 5.20 - 1/30/99 A bug fix only, affecting ubb\_library.pl, postings.cgi,ubb\_library2.pl, and cplinks.html. Thanks to Alex Krohn, of [Gossamer Threads](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207100935/http%3A//www.gossamer-threads.com/), for spotting a couple of holes. One could allow someone to hack their way into posting a reply to a closed thread. The other could allow someone to cause some trouble using a phoney thread number. Version 5.19 - 1/3/99 A bug fix only, affecting Ultimate.cgi, postings.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, ubbmisc.cgi, ubb\_library.pl. ubb\_library2.pl. and cplinks.html. There was bug in one line of code relating to the setting of long-term cookies with javascript. This was preventing cookies from being stored properly after the new year. Did not affect any major functions of the UBB, but it did prevent the lightbulbs and folder colors from displaying properly. Version 5.18 - 11/30/98 A minor bug fix, affecting edit.cgi. The prune function was not properly updating the lastnumber.file. This was resulting in empty/false numbers for pruned forums (on the forum summary page). To upgrade from 5.17, replace edit.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, and cplinks.html. Also not that you can easily fix any forums that were pruned incorrectly before by simply running another prune (after you upgrade to 5.18 of course) on the affected forum(s)- even if you only prune 1 thread. Version 5.17 - 11/27/98 A MAJOR bug fix, but the bug only exists for those currently using 5.15-5.16. Affected ubbmisc.cgi... caused some profiles to not be updated properly. Also updated: ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, and cplinks.html. Version 5.16 - 11/25/98 A very minor upgrade. Repaired bug affecting new random number variables. SOm ecode was left out of 5.15 that prevented the random numbers from being add to HTML pages during the Update Threads function. This has been added in 5.16. Affected cpanel2.cgi, ubb\_library.pl, ubb\_library2.pl, postings.cgi, and cplinks.html. Version 5.15 - 11/22/98 A minor upgrade, but includes a sucurity bug fix that should be considered necessary (especially is you currently use Version 5.12 - 5.14). Affected most CGI directory files, as well as cplinks.html. As usual, make suer you reset general and style variables and update threads after upgrading!   * Fixed security-related   bug in cpanel2.cgi that affected general and style variable setup.* Added category-ony     view option for intro page, for sites with very many categories     and forums. In this mode, users will see only a list of categories     when first entering the UBB. Clicking on a specific category name     takes the user to a summary of forums within that category. This     is a configurable option in the control panel.* Fixed a       small bug related to profile updating on NT servers.* Added two         random variables for use in header or footer (ideal for banner         ads). To insert/generate a random number in your header or footer,         use either UBBrandomX or UBBandomY (not case-sensitive) anywhere         in your header or footer. A random number will be generated by         the UBB and replace the variables each time the header/footer         is called. Note that HTML pages are not dynamically genereated         everytime a user calls them- thus the random number will only         be created each time the HTML changes (or is updated). All other         pages (the non HTML pages) will have a new random number generated         each time someone calls a page. Note that         UBBrandomX and UBBrandomY are two different random numbers (thus,         you could use one for your header, and the other for your footer).         These are 7-digit, completely numeric numbers.  Also note         that these two random numbers can only be used in the header         or footer variables.  Version 5.14 - 11/18/98 A minor upgrade, but includes a couple of small bug fixes- worth upgrading for! Affected cpanel2.cgi, cpanel3.cgi, ubb\_library2.pl, ubb\_library.pl, and cplinks.html.   * Fixed small   bug in general variables setup routine of cpanel2.cgi. Wouldn't   affect most users, but could prevent proper setup for some.* Fixed small     bug in cpanel3.cgi file- prevented ANNC directory from being directed     with new forums.  Version 5.13 - 11/16/98 A minor upgrade. Affected cpanel.cgi, edit.cgi, ubbmisc.cgi, Ultimate.cgi, forumdisplay.cgi, search.cgi, cpanel2.cgi, ubb\_library2.pl, ubb\_library.pl, postings.cgi and cplinks.html.  Note- version 5.13a fixed a bug in 5.13 affecting cpanel2.cgi.  Note: make sure you reset both general variables and style variables in this update AND Update Threads.   * Added BOLD   tags to table header column on main forum summary page.* Added new     Style color variable- TimeColor. This is used to differentiate     the time on the main forum summary page and on the forum pages.     It also is used for the "posted" line for each thread     on the thread pages.* Added truncate       feature. Words that are more than 60 characters long will be automatically       broken up into 60-word maximum words. Thus, a word that is 100       characters long (no spaces) will be broken down into two separate       words (one 60 characters, the other 40 characters). This will       prevent tables from becoming hyperextended.* Moved META         tages above javascript tags in HEAD or HTML pages. There is a         bug in Netscape 4.5 that was preventing pages from being properly         forwarded when the META refresh tags were listed below any javascript.         Moving this seems to have solved the problem.* Fixed TimeZone           Offset problem for thread displays (affected change-of-day updating).* Added new             Date format to general variables section of control panel. Now             you can have the actual month name appear on your dates.  Version 5.12 - 11/11/98 A minor upgrade. Affected cpanel2.cgi, ubb\_library2.pl, ubb\_library.pl, postings.cgi and cplinks.html.   * Adjusted   some code on the Update Threads routine, bacause it seemed some   NT users were having some thread files not being created in the   process. These files were thus turningup missing.* Streamlined     the first time install process. Also adjusted the Freeware version,     incidentally, in this regard. Now, first time installers will     nothave to manually create the first 9 Forum directories, as was     previously required. In addition, for those installing UNIX servers,     permission do not have to be set on the NONCGI, CGI, and Members     directories (though permissions on the CGI directory files themselves     will still need to be performed). First-time install instructions     have been modfied to reflect the improved setup.* Added pipestem       conversion to all messages to prevent "eating" of pipes.  Version 5.11 - 11/5/98 A very minor upgrade. Affected postings.cgi. ubb\_library2.pl, ubb\_library.pl, ubbmisc.cgi, and cplinks.html.   * Added check   for none to moderator notify code. In 5.10, code was added to   prevent server errors when posting messages to forums with moderator   notification turned on, but with no moderator assigned to the   forum. Additional code was added in 5.11 that also checked for   "none".* Fixed minor     smiley bug that affected users posting anchor tags with a closing     parenthesis. Kind of obscure, but it is not fixed.* Added tightened       code for preventing images in signature blocks.* Added additional         code to improve Update Threads routine. Very minor.  Version 5.10 - 11/2/98 Major upgrade, but not in terms of new features. Much of the code was tightened and/or reorganized in an attempt to improve the processing speed for users with very active sites. Ultimate.cgi no longer controls all primary UBB processing- that file was broken down into some smaller files to reduce the overhead required each time a Perl process is started. Thus, many new files were created- forumdisplay.cgi, postings.cgi, ubbmisc.cgi, ubblibrary2.pl, and cpanel3.cgi. In addition, cgi-lib.pl is no longer required (this will make life easier for users on Hiway servers). IMPORTANT: Be sure to UPDATE YOUR THREADS and reset your General Variables and Style variables when upgrading!  Aside from code reorganization, the following specific changes were made:   * Added HTML   4.0 ACRONYM tags to clarify the "profile", "prefs",   "register", "faq", and "search"   links.* Added clickable     link on pages with auto-forwards for users that either do not     want to wait to be forwarded or for whom the page doens not automatically     forward.* Added thread       topic to top of table on HTML thread pages.* Fixed bug         affecting deletion of messages within a thread. If message to         be deleted was in the middle of the thread, the other files were         not being properly renamed, which was throwing off the last date/time         returns.* Allowed           background colors to be set to nothing.* Significantly             improved processing of Forum Display pages. New files are generated             by the UBB (files end in ".thread" and will appear in             the indeivisual Forum directories) that will store thread info             for faster processing of threads in forums.* Added new               Signature feature. Now users may store signatures to be displayed               with each post. Admins may disable this feature, if they prefer.               Signatures may not contain HTML, but may contain UBB Code (except               the UBB Code for images).  Version 5.09 - 8/21/98 Very minor upgrade that added some additional code to prevent certain users from experiencing problems with the "Hop To" menus. Most users are not affected by these changes. Version 5.08 - 8/17/98 Affected search.cgi, ubb\_html.pl, ubb\_library.pl, and Ultimate.cgi.Fixed minor bug related to 24-hour time display.Improved edit funtion so that code will be converted from HTML to UBB Code when editing (on forums that have UBB on, but HTML off).Improved search function so that results will be limited to maximum of 500 matches. This will prevent the program from crashing if someone does a a very vague search that could produce thousands of matches. Version 5.07 - 8/14/98 Streamlined many internal processes, which resulted in some processing improvements. Though this release may not have any obvious improvements from the outside, it is a major enhancement "under the hood". The following changes were also made:   * fixed the   000000 footer bug* fixed Page     Background call up in Styles area of control panel* Improved       Topics page generation* changed         META tag links to full URL, rather than relative links on some         "wait two/three second pages"* refined           thread routine on reply form* fixed some             index-related bugs in the control panel edit/prune area* broke down               the re-indexing routine into smaller chunks so that those with               many messages can more easily index their site* fixed alternating                 table colors in control panel* added new                   Version Update option in control panel so that users can easily                   see what the latest version of the UBB is and compare it to their                   own version. Thanks to Mark at AuctionWatch for coming up with                   this idea and providing most of the code!* fixed some                     internal bugs that may have been slowing processing down* Added separate                       NT version: you will notice that there are two different "versions"                       available. One is recommended for Win32/NY servers, the other                       for every one else. I did this because I wasn't sure if the new                       eval functions that were added in 5.06n for NT users would have                       any affect on all other servers. To be on the safe side, I released                       separate editions. Eventually, if things prove to be okay on all                       servers through further testing, I may return it back to a single                       version for all servers.  Version 5.06a - 8/7/98 Corrects time-related bug created by new WebTen-friendly extensions. Affected Ultimate.cgi and ubb\_library.pl. Version 5.06 - 8/7/98 Minor update that adds complete support for WebTen users. Also, adds new code (thanks to Johnny Hughes!) that will make life easier for NT users- no more manual updating of require statements! Also fixed a small bug in the index routine- the display page kept refreshing. Affected 7 files. Version 5.05a - 8/6/98 Only one thing- fixed Ultimate.cgi file. There was a typo that was preventing the Lost Password feature from working properly. Version 5.05 - 8/5/98 Fixed some typos and some small bugs, reverted back to old way of storing member profiles (the new way was causing problems for certain users). Affected numerous files.   * Fixed typoes   in FAQ.* Fixed moderator     notify radio button* Improved       edit/prune fucntions* Added new         variable- VariablesPath. This variable should be the same as the         CGI Path for most users, but for those users who cannot have writeable         fiels in their CGI directories, this new variable allows them         to moce these variable files to a new directory and simply set         the new location using this variable. The variable files are:         UltBB.setup, mods.file, Styles.file, and forums.cgi.* Fixed bug           that was allowing for threads in closed forums to be searchable.* Fixed centering             on Topic page.* Added "Update               Threads" as control panel option.* Added nee                 Search functionality- ability to search usernames exactly or by                 partial match. Also limited search display to 30 matches per page.  Version 5.02 - 7/31/98 Fixed a number of small bugs. Affected cp.html, cpanel.cgi, memberconverter.cgi, Ultimate.cgi, ubb\_html.pl, ubb\_library.pl, and ubbcode.html.   * Fixed name   space problem for new registrations.* Fixed moderator     email bug.* Fixed header/footer       variable bug- script was converting carriage returns to HTML codes.* Fixed folder         color notication bug on Topic pages.* Fixed index           bug that was adding posts from closed forums to the index, thus           making them searchable.* Added new             feature- posts in closed threads can no longer be edited.* Adjusted               cp.html file so that top frame is not truncated.* Added a                 check in the memberconverter.cgi file that will prevent members.cgi                 files from being overwritten is someone has already converted                 their members.  Version 5.01 - 7/30/98 Fixed bug related to new member registrations. Basically, if you tried to update user registrations through the control panel, the program was creating some extra carriage returns, which threw off the registrations. Only affected ubb\_library.pl. If you downloaded 5.0 and updated permissions, you should re-run the memberconverter.cgi file after you upload the new ubb\_library.pl file (be sure to replace your current members.cgi file with the members.cgi file that came with 5.00 or 5.01 before you run the conversion, however). Version 5.00 - 7/29/98 Major upgrade, adding the following new features and changes. Affected most old files, added several new files.   * NEW- Moderator   notification. Set in control panel, allows forum moderators to   receive email notification every time someone posts new note in   forum.* NEW- Header     and Footer variables, set in control panel. Allows admins to include     customized code (HTML, banner ad code, graphics, etc.) on most     UBB pages.* NEW- Custom       title graphics for each forum. Set in the control panel, under       forums.* NEW - Announcements.         These are one-way communications from admins or moderators. Users         can not post replies. Options include, start and end date for         the announcement (how long the announcement will be visible),         and the ability to post to multiple forums at once.* NEW- Search           Engine. Users can now search by word, username, date, and forum.           Utilizes a new indexing feature that allows for very fast searches.* NEW- Email             View option for each registered user. Users can "turn off"             their email addresses so that they are not viewable on the bulletin             board (they are still visible to admins in the control panel).* NEW- additional               UBB Codes for bold and italics.* NEW- date                 stamp added to edite post wording.* NEW - added                   option to turn off UBB Code IMAGES tag (all other UBB Codes would                   still function).* Fixed SMTP                     [from] field in sockets email subroutine.* Improved                       minimum member code.* Added preferences                         to registration page.* Added means                           to access individual forums directly (bypassing main entry point).                           Just use the URL forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics=X=here as your                           URL, with X being the forum number you want to provide a direct                           link to. Using this URL will ensure proper cookie storage of access                           times.* Upgraded                             FAQ, which is now a separate HTML file.* Added indexing                               function, which is used to speed searches.* Changed                                 registration file system. Registration profiles are no longer                                 stored as separate files; rather they are stored in a single file                                 called members.cgi. If upgrading from a previous version, you                                 will need to convert your previous registrations to the new format                                 by running the memberconverter.cgi script.* Many other                                   minor improvements.

  funny enough, on the page they state that they're running Ultimate Bulletin Board \
Version 5.47a

  quick fix perhaps? (the authentication fails..)

  Ultimate Bulletin Board - Private forums security hole, by tdf (tdf@linuxbr.com.br)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, i can see any open topic inside a private forum (password protected) \
WITHOUT have the password.  How? It's simple! Using the quote feature of the Ultimate \
Bulletin Board!

    Look this example:

    <http://www.scriptkeeper.com/cgi-bin/postings.cgi?action=reply&forum=tdf&number=21&topic=000004.cgi&TopicSubject=tdf&replyto=0>

    Hmm, it's a Infopop's help forum, using the last version of UBB (5.73)
    This session of the forum is reserved for moderators only, and protected with a \
password.

    Put this url in your web browser and see it with your own eyes!
    I can see all open threads in this session of the forum just changing the number \
of the xxxxx.cgi, and all its replies changing replyto=XX

    You noted that I can quote a msg without give the password... The problem is \
there :)

    c-ya!
