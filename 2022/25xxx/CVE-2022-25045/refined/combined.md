# Home Owners Collection Management System in PHP/OOP Free Source Code

 [![](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/oretnom23/hocms_dashbaord.png?itok=7GF8b6GF)](/sites/default/files/images/oretnom23/hocms_dashbaord.png)

## **Introduction**

This is a **Simple PHP** entitled **Home Owners Collection Management System**. This simple project is a web-based application developed in PHP and MySQL Database. It provides the **Subdivisions/Villages Homeowners Association** an automated platform for efficient and effective managing and recording of the collections. The application stores the collection records of the homeowners association members along with some relevant data. It has a simple and pleasant user interface. It is easy to use and has user-friendly features and functionalities.

## **About the Home Owners Collection Management System**

I developed this project using the following:

* **[XAMPP v3.3.0](https://apachefreinds.org)** as my local webserver that has a **PHP Version 8.0.7**
* **PHP Language**
* **MySQL Database**
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**
* **jQuery**
* **Ajax**
* **Bootstrap**
* **AdminLTE**
* and more...

The **Home Owners Collection Management System Project** requires the management to log in their system user credentials in order to access the features and functionalities of this system. The system users are composed of 2 types of roles which are the **Administrators** and **Staff** users. The **Administrators** have the privilege to access all the features and functionalities of the system while the **Staff Users** have only limited access. The management is required to populate the Collection Categories and Phase List first in using the system for the first time. The system also generates printable monthly collection reports.

Note: Due to the size or complexity of this submission, the author has submitted it as a .zip file to shorten your download time. After downloading it, you will need a program like Winzip to decompress it.

Virus note: All files are scanned once-a-day by SourceCodester.com for viruses, but new viruses come out every day, so no prevention program can catch 100% of them.

FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, PLEASE:

1. Re-scan downloaded files using your personal virus checker before using it.

2. NEVER, EVER run compiled files (.exe's, .ocx's, .dll's etc.)--only run source code.

| [CVE-2022-25045](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fx79-mjmf-224h "CVE-2022-25045") Exploit Title: Home Owners Collection Management System — Use of Hard-coded Credentials in Source Code Leads to Admin Panel Access  Exploit Author: VIVEK PANDAY  Vendor Homepage: <https://www.sourcecodester.com/>  Software Link: <https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15162/home-owners-collection-management-system-phpoop-free-source-code.html>  Tested on Windows10  Linkedln Contact: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-panday-796768149>  Hardcoded Credentials:  Hardcoded Passwords, also often referred to as Embedded Credentials, are plain text passwords or other secrets in source code. Password hardcoding refers to the practice of embedding plain text (non-encrypted) passwords and other secrets (SSH Keys, DevOps secrets, etc.) into the source code. Default, hardcoded passwords may be used across many of the same devices, applications, systems, which helps simplify set up at scale, but at the same time, poses a considerable cybersecurity risk.  [Attack Vectors]  An attacker can gain admin panel access using default credentials and do malicious activities  Proof Of Concept  1 Download source code from <https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15162/home-owners-collection-management-system-phpoop-free-source-code.html>  2 Now unzip it and go to the Database folder here we can see one SQL file.  3 Now open that file using Notepad and there we can see admin credentials. but the password is encrypted .from pattern I identified that this is MD5 hash. so we can easily decrypt using crackstation.net or any hash cracker tools like Hashcat, John the ripper. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
