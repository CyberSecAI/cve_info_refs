Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-25882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `external_data` field within a tensor proto in ONNX models was not properly validated, allowing a path to a file outside the model's directory or user-provided directory. This could be exploited by using relative paths like `../../../etc/passwd`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. The lack of proper validation of the `external_data` path allows an attacker to specify paths that reach outside the intended model directory.
- **Path Manipulation**: The vulnerability can be exploited by using "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences or absolute file paths in the `external_data` field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read arbitrary files on the system, including sensitive information like application source code, configuration files, and other critical system files.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing arbitrary files through this vulnerability (e.g., overwriting an executable or configuration file with malicious code), it could lead to arbitrary code execution. This is similar to a "Zip-Slip" vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker crafts a malicious ONNX model file where the `external_data` field of a tensor contains a path to a file outside the model's directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide or control the ONNX model that is loaded by the vulnerable ONNX runtime. The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by normalizing the relative path inside the tensor and checking that the normalized path does not start with a "../" sequence.
- The fix implements a `clean_relative_path` function based on Go's `path.Clean()` function but simplified for relative paths.
- The fix also included additional checks on POSIX systems to prevent symlinks and directories from being loaded as external data.
- The fix also include a check for symlinks only on POSIX systems, as windows doesn't use symlinks in the same way.

The provided files also include a Proof of Concept (POC) ONNX model and python script, demonstrating how this vulnerability can be exploited with a crafted ONNX model file.

The vulnerability is fixed in onnx version 1.13.0 and higher.
