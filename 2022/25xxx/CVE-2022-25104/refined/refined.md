Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an arbitrary file download issue in HorizontCMS v1.0.0-beta-2.
*   The application allows users to download files via the `/admin/file-manager/download` endpoint.
*   The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper input sanitization/validation of the `file` parameter, which is used to specify the path to the file to be downloaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal due to the ability to use `../` sequences in the `file` parameter to navigate outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary file download:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, database files, or system files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/admin/file-manager/download` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated `file` parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `file` parameter in the GET request to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **No authentication required for download (likely)**: The provided exploit does not mention authentication, which implies that the `/admin/file-manager/download` endpoint is accessible without prior authentication.
