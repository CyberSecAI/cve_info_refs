Security

The following security issues are fixed in this release. Thanks to the
Polish Financial Supervision Authority IT Security Department (UKNF)
for reporting the first two issues below.

* RT is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) when displaying
attachment content with fraudulent content types. This vulnerability
is assigned [CVE-2022-25802](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25802).

* RT 5.0 is vulnerable to unvalidated, or open, redirects in ticket
searches. This vulnerability is assigned [CVE-2022-25803](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25803).

* RT did not perform full rights checks on accesses to file or image type
custom fields, possibly allowing access to these custom fields by users
without rights to access to the associated objects (like the ticket it
is associated with).

As an additional security note, RT 5.0.3 also updates jQuery to
version 3.6.0 and that includes a security fix ([CVE-2020-11022](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11022)).
