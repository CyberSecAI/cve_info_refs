- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The handling of arguments such as IP addresses in the CLI of affected devices is prone to buffer overï¬‚ows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, remote attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device.
