- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the handling of POST requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform actions on the application as a user, potentially leading to unauthorized changes to user settings, data modification or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTML form and tricking a user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML form and convince a victim to submit it while the victim is logged in to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable system itself.
