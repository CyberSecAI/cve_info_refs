| I tested Your above html - code ([pushstate](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6193983/how-does-pushstate-protect-against-potential-content-forgeries)) with Edge (and newest Firefox) at one of my 5.2-sites .../User with result after klick at the button : Not found - The requested page does not exist. Please use the website navigation to reach the existing pages. Opera gives already before a long warning. ( Typesetter5.2+ has now a different ajax and form : < form action="/User" method="post" class="well">< input type="hidden" name="nonce" value="fafcc029e5642290ef1c4c8f8e7fc93eb2205a05142c84db2ce30c6c88ed856aeedb4001ec4f926f1647e52e36b001fbd24342059d2b0b802bf178f61b6a12e3">< div class="form-group">Email Address< /label>....)   * For purists is [this site](http://www.hakoniemi.net/tricky/basic_xss.js) - add to some init.JS in the template - modify the reaction. * You may also look at [githubs's solution](https://github.blog/2010-12-07-the-tree-slider/). |

| That's correct, but only available as a beta. Betaversions are generally not suitable for production usage.  I know you are working on a PHP8-ready version, but this repository (from the origin maintainer) is outdated. I am sorry to say that, but that's a fact.  I like Typesetter, its a lightweight, easy to use and fast CMS, but I only want to use releases (which are not in alpha or beta status).  If the maintainer doesn't continuing the work and nobody adopted this project to proceed the engineering - the CMS is dead. This is what it looks like for me. Sorry. |

| The only known possibility was in the download of plugins and templates (has been fixed in the php8-version in common.php <http://www.typesettercms.com>' to **https**://www.typesettercms.com') for web-installation. But thats only a theoretical possibility because the hacker must watch the source which tries to download such zips (and the download has a special interface). - and : I never had such problems ! The fix was because of php8. |

| Sorry : You are riding on a dead horse : We use Typesetter 5.2+. Of course it would be possible to prevent compromised packages by adding hashes etc.. I have no control over Typesettercms.com - sorry (yes : the download-version there is 5.1 (...) and should be updated to the github - master.. |

| Good for you.  The official release yet on the OFFICIAL Typesetter releases page is 5.1 - Kindly visit <https://github.com/Typesetter/Typesetter/releases>  This issue was created for those who do follow the officially released versions \*which is 5.1 as the latest and is eventually vulnerable to Cross-site request forgery. |
