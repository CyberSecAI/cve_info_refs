- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `id` parameter in the `mtms/admin/?page=transaction/view_details` URL, allowing an attacker to inject SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive data from the database, modify data, or perform other malicious actions. The provided proof of concept shows that a malicious user can extract the current database user by injecting SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable page with a malicious SQL query in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
