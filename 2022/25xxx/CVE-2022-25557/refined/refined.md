Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-25557 (Based on the content description)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the `saveParentControlInfo` function of the Tenda AX1806 router's firmware. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy data from the `urls` parameter of an HTTP POST request into a heap buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the use of `strcpy` to copy an attacker-controlled string into a fixed-size buffer allocated on the heap.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the length of the `urls` parameter before copying it into the buffer. This allows an attacker to provide a string larger than the buffer, resulting in a heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a POST request to `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` with a large string in the `urls` parameter, an attacker can trigger a heap overflow leading to a crash of the device, thus causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/saveParentControlInfo`.
- **`urls` parameter:** The `urls` parameter within the POST request's body is the vector of the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Tenda AX1806 router, typically this would involve being on the same network as the router or having access through a compromised device on the same network.
- **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft a POST request with a large `urls` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to trigger the denial of service vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Tenda Router AX1806 v1.0.0.1 and potentially other versions.
- The vulnerability is located in the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` page.
- The vulnerability occurs in the `saveParentControlInfo` function which calls the sub\_60CFC function.
- The vulnerable `strcpy` call occurs in sub\_60CFC function.
