#### Introduced: 6 Jun 2022

[CVE-2022-25851  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25851) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.webjars.npm:jpeg-js` to version 0.4.4 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) where a particular piece of input will cause to enter an infinite loop and never return.

## PoC

1. Create a npm workspace `npm init`
2. Install the `jpeg-js` library
3. Create a JS file with the following code:

```
const jpeg = require('jpeg-js');

let buf = Buffer.from( 'ffd8ffc1f151d800ff51d800ffdaffde', 'hex' );
jpeg.decode( buf );

```

4. Run the file and observe that the code never stops running
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

| The following input can create a infinite loop inside jpeg-js causing it to never return:  ``` const jpeg = require('jpeg-js');  let buf = Buffer.from( 'ffd8ffc1f151d800ff51d800ffdaffde', 'hex' ); jpeg.decode( buf );  ```  Based on some preliminary debugging it appears to be related to the following code:   [jpeg-js/lib/decoder.js](https://github.com/jpeg-js/jpeg-js/blob/b58cc11b29a66f853b4195d31e9e2de6080fcd7a/lib/decoder.js#L579-L589)  Lines 579 to 589 in [b58cc11](/jpeg-js/jpeg-js/commit/b58cc11b29a66f853b4195d31e9e2de6080fcd7a)   |  | var maxH = 0, maxV = 0; | | --- | --- | |  | var component, componentId; | |  | for (componentId in frame.components) { | |  | if (frame.components.hasOwnProperty(componentId)) { | |  | component = frame.components[componentId]; | |  | if (maxH < component.h) maxH = component.h; | |  | if (maxV < component.v) maxV = component.v; | |  | } | |  | } | |  | var mcusPerLine = Math.ceil(frame.samplesPerLine / 8 / maxH); | |  | var mcusPerColumn = Math.ceil(frame.scanLines / 8 / maxV); |      Here `maxH` and `maxV` are initialized to zero, but since there are no components, the values are never modified, leading to a divide by zero error in the last two line (which set `mcusPerLine` and `mcusPerColumn` to `Infinity`).  These values are later used inside the `decodeAsScan()` function, where the following loop condition never evaluates to false since `mcuExpected` is set to `frame.mcusPerLine * frame.mcusPerColumn` (i.e. `Infinity * Infinity`) at line 292 in `/lib/decoder.js`.   [jpeg-js/lib/decoder.js](https://github.com/jpeg-js/jpeg-js/blob/b58cc11b29a66f853b4195d31e9e2de6080fcd7a/lib/decoder.js#L297)  Line 297 in [b58cc11](/jpeg-js/jpeg-js/commit/b58cc11b29a66f853b4195d31e9e2de6080fcd7a)   |  | while (mcu < mcuExpected) { | | --- | --- |      found using [jsfuzz](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/fuzzers/jsfuzz) |

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

| Also fixed failing tests  There shouldn't be failing tests. Can you elaborate? <https://github.com/jpeg-js/jpeg-js/runs/3080117536?check_suite_focus=true>  The max resolution and max memory tests kept hitting the sampling factor error (which I added in the current patch) before the respective errors that were being tested causing both of those tests to fail.  The changes wrt to the old tests just replace the old binary blobs with ones that do not hit the sampling factor error but rather only the specific errors being tested.  Wrt to the fix itself, I was basing it on how the libjpeg-turbo and libjpeg libraries handled this particular scenario: <https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/blob/1f55ae7b0fa3acc348a630171617d0e56d922b68/jdinput.c#L64-L78>  Based on their documentation, the sampling rate must be between 1 and 4 according to the JPEG standard (thus side-stepping the divide by zero issue). <https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/blob/9abeff46d87bd201a952e276f3e4339556a403a3/libjpeg.txt#L1138-L1146> |
