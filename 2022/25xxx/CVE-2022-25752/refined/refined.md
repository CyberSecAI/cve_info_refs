- **Root Cause:** The webserver of affected devices calculates session IDs and nonces in an insecure manner.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Use of insufficiently random values when generating session IDs and nonces.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can brute-force session IDs and hijack existing sessions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the device.
- **Attack Vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated, remote, and needs to induce a victim user to initiate a session.
