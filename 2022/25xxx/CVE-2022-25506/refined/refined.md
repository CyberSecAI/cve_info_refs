- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `/AuthenticateUser` API endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/AuthenticateUser` API endpoint. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `username` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information, including usernames, user IDs, and clear-text passwords from the `SystemUser` table in the SQLite3 database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious payload within the `username` parameter of the `/AuthenticateUser` API request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a valid API key to exploit this vulnerability. This key could be obtained through a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on an end-user device or may be available to a UAV operator.
