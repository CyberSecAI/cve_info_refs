  "cve": "CVE-2022-25883",
  "description": "The semver package versions before 5.7.2, from 6.0.0 before 6.3.1, and from 7.0.0 before 7.5.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the function `new Range` when untrusted user data is provided as a range.",
  "affected_versions": "<5.7.2, >=6.0.0 <6.3.1, >=7.0.0 <7.5.2",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a poorly constructed regular expression used in the `new Range` function of the semver package. When provided with a crafted string, the regular expression engine can enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, leading to excessive CPU consumption.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
  ],
  "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) by excessively consuming CPU resources, making the system inaccessible to legitimate users.",
  "attack_vectors": "Providing a specially crafted string as input to the `new Range` function. This input is typically user-provided data that is used to define a version range.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide input that is processed by the vulnerable function. No specific privileges are required.",
   "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located in the `new Range` function, specifically in how whitespace is handled when parsing a version range string. The regex `re[t.CARETTRIM]` was vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking due to greedy whitespace matching. The fix involves trimming whitespace and collapsing it into a single space. This was resolved in commit 717534e. Versions 5.x and 6.x are also affected but no fix has been backported to these versions. A PoC is included."
