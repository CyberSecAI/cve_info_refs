- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A type-check exception in V8 occurs when verifying the type of the second argument to the `.powm` function. Specifically, when the second argument is `undefined`, V8 crashes, bypassing Node.js try/catch blocks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Denial of Service (DoS) due to the type-check error in the `.powm` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The V8 engine crashes, leading to a denial of service. This crash occurs regardless of Node.js's try/catch blocks, making the application unstable.
- **Attack vectors**: By calling the `.powm` function with `undefined` as the second argument.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute code that calls the `.powm` function with a specific input (`undefined`). This can occur if an attacker can control the input to the `.powm` function.
