The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25026.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the application not properly validating user-supplied URLs used for HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can induce the application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain.
- Unauthorised access to internal services within the organization's infrastructure.
- Potential for further attacks against internal services or back-end systems.
- Access to the Instance Metadata Service in cloud environments like AWS, potentially allowing the retrieval of temporary credentials.
- Exposure of sensitive information from internal web pages such as Git, Confluence, or SharePoint.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker sends a crafted URL to the vulnerable page: `https://example.com/trufusionPortal/upDwModuleProxy?upDwUrl={url}`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable URL format.
- The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the SSRF vulnerability itself, but a valid session cookie gained by exploiting the authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2022-25027) can be used.
