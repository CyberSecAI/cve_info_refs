[CVE-2022-25295  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25295) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-601  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## Amendment

This was deemed not a vulnerability.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The Open Redirect vulnerability exists in the `next` query parameter. The application uses `url.Parse(r.FormValue("next"))` to extract path and eventually redirect user to a relative URL, but if `next` parameter starts with multiple backslashes like `\\\\\\example.com`, browser will redirect user to `http://example.com`.

### @Kirill89 **[Kirill89](/Kirill89)** commented [Jul 14, 2021](#issue-944866275)

This PR fixes Open Redirect vulnerability in `next` query parameter of login and reset password pages.

To reproduce this issue you need to open `https://localhost:3333/login?next=\\\\\\example.com` and then login. You are going to be redirected to `https://example.com`.

[@jordan-wright](https://github.com/jordan-wright) and I had a discussion about this vulnerability in email.

Sorry, something went wrong.
