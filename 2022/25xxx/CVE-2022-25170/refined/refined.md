The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25170.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that occurs while processing project files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting malicious project files that, when opened by the vulnerable software, trigger the buffer overflow, out-of-bounds write, or out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious project file.
- The user needs to open the malicious project file.
- The attack is local.
- Low attack complexity is noted.
