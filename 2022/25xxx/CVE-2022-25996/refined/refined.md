The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25996.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `confsrv addTimeGroup` function of the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi firmware. This is due to the usage of `strcpy` without proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `strcpy` function copies the content of the `week` field from a TimeRule protobuf into a fixed-size stack buffer without checking the length of the input string, leading to a buffer overflow if the string exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite stack memory by sending a specially crafted network packet, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The crash information shows the program crashing with the return address overwritten, indicating a successful stack-based buffer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious network packet to port 9003 on the LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi device.
- The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network provided by the LinkHub Mesh device to send the malicious packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability
- The attacker must be able to craft and send specific protocol buffer messages with oversized 'week' string in a TimeRule structure
