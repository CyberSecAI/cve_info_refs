Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-25181:

**CVE-2022-25181**

*   **Root Cause:** The Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin uses the same workspace directory for all checkouts of Pipeline libraries with the same name, regardless of the SCM being used and the source of the library configuration.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Sandbox bypass due to shared workspace directories for Pipeline libraries.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission can execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM through crafted SCM contents if a global Pipeline library already exists.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with Item/Configure permission can craft malicious SCM content in a Pipeline library.
    *   If a global pipeline library already exists the attacker can leverage this to inject their malicious code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs Item/Configure permission.
    *  A global Pipeline library needs to already exist.

**Affected Plugin:**

*   `workflow-cps-global-lib` (Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin) versions up to and including 552.vd9cc05b8a2e1.

**Fixed Plugin Version:**

*   `workflow-cps-global-lib` (Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin) version 561.va\_ce0de3c2d69 uses distinct checkout directories per SCM for Pipeline libraries.
