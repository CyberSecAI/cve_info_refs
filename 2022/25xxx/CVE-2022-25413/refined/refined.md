{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input before storing it in the database, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code through the `f_tags` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to phishing sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the `f_tags` parameter in the admin page (`~/admin/page_edit/`) when creating or editing a page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin panel to create or edit pages."
