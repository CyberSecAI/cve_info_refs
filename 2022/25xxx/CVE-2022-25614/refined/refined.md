**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-25614

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress eRoom â€“ Zoom Meetings & Webinar Plugin

**Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.3.7

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing malicious actors to potentially force higher-privileged users to execute unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to make changes or perform actions in the name of the targeted user, without the user's consent or awareness. The specific impact would depend on the actions available within the plugin's interface to a higher privileged user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a malicious webpage or link that, when accessed by an authenticated user, sends unauthorized requests to the vulnerable WordPress plugin on behalf of that user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user (especially higher privileged users) into visiting a malicious page or clicking on a malicious link.
*   No specific user privileges are required for the attacker.
