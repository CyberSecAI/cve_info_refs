The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) standard, collectively named TETRA:BURST. CVE-2022-25332 is not explicitly mentioned, however, the content contains descriptions for CVE-2022-24400, CVE-2022-24401, CVE-2022-24402, CVE-2022-24403 and CVE-2022-24404.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**CVE-2022-24401:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Air Interface Encryption (AIE) keystream generator relies on the network time, which is publicly broadcast without authentication.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication on network time allows manipulation
*   **Impact:** Decryption oracle attacks, leading to loss of confidentiality and authenticity.
*   **Attack Vector:** Active attacker.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to manipulate network time broadcasts

**CVE-2022-24402:**

*   **Root Cause:** The TEA1 algorithm contains a backdoor that drastically reduces the effective key size.
*   **Weakness:** Intentionally weakened cryptographic algorithm
*   **Impact:**  Full break of the cipher, leading to loss of confidentiality and authenticity as the key can be easily brute-forced
*   **Attack Vector:** Passive or active attacker.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to intercept and potentially inject traffic on TETRA networks

**CVE-2022-24404:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of ciphertext authentication on AIE.
*   **Weakness:** Missing integrity checks on encrypted data
*   **Impact:** Malleability attacks, allowing attackers to modify encrypted messages without detection leading to loss of authenticity.
*   **Attack Vector:** Active attacker.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to inject traffic on TETRA networks.

**CVE-2022-24403:**

*   **Root Cause:** Weak design in the cryptographic scheme used to obfuscate radio identities.
*  **Weakness:** Weak obfuscation of radio identities
*   **Impact:**  User deanonymization and tracking.
*   **Attack Vector:** Passive attacker.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to intercept TETRA communications

**CVE-2022-24400:**

*   **Root Cause:** Flaw in the authentication algorithm.
*  **Weakness:** Vulnerability in the authentication process
*   **Impact:** Attackers can set the Derived Cypher Key (DCK) to 0, leading to loss of authenticity and partial loss of confidentiality, also allows for uplink interception and access to post-authentication protocol functionality
*   **Attack Vector:** Active attacker.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to inject traffic on TETRA networks
