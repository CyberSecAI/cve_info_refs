Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `formSetSysToolDDNS` function within the Tenda AX1806 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsafe String Copy:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the value of the `ddnsEn` HTTP request parameter into a stack-allocated buffer (`v15`) without any bounds checking.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate the length of the `ddnsEn` parameter before copying it into the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a long `ddnsEn` parameter, an attacker can cause a stack overflow, leading to a crash and subsequent denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` endpoint.
- **Malicious Payload:** The malicious payload is embedded in the `ddnsEn` parameter of the HTTP request, consisting of an overly long string designed to overflow the buffer `v15`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically implies the attacker being on the same network as the router.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` endpoint and the vulnerable parameter `ddnsEn`.
