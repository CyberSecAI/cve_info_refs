**CVE-2022-25192**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Snow Commander Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation and also does not require POST requests for these methods.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Missing permission check**: The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the form validation methods.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The form validation methods do not require POST requests which makes them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit the missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability by crafting a malicious request that executes the vulnerable form validation method.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs Overall/Read permission to access the vulnerable form validation methods. They also need to obtain valid credentials IDs through another method.

**Summary of vulnerability:**
The Snow Commander Plugin has a vulnerability where it doesn't properly check user permissions for form validation methods, and it lacks CSRF protection. This allows an attacker with 'Overall/Read' permission to send requests to an attacker controlled server using credentials stored in Jenkins. This can result in the capture of these credentials.
