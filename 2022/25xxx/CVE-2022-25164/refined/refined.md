Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-25164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312):** The software stores sensitive information in a way that is not encrypted or protected, making it accessible to unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is the insecure storage of sensitive data in cleartext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information can be disclosed to unauthorized users.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to MELSEC iQ-R/F/L series CPU modules and MELSEC iQ-R series OPC UA server modules.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable over a network (`AV:N`).
*   The attack complexity is low (`AC:L`), meaning it's relatively easy to exploit.
*   No privileges are required for exploitation (`PR:N`), and there's no need for user interaction (`UI:N`).
* The scope is changed (`S:C`), impacting other components/systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers need to be able to communicate over the network with the affected system.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   GX Works3: Versions 1.000A to 1.011M, 1.015R to 1.087R, 1.090U, and 1.095Z.
*   MX OPC UA Module Configurator-R: Version 1.08J and prior.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is described as an "Information disclosure vulnerability."
*   The vulnerability has a high CVSS v3 base score of 8.6.
*   Mitigation includes updating to fixed versions of the software, and ensuring network security (making project files inaccessible via untrusted network).

This information provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-25164, its potential impact, and the necessary steps to mitigate it.
