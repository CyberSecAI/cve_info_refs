### @jaredhanson **[jaredhanson](/jaredhanson)** commented [May 20, 2022](#issue-1242490139)

This PR addresses session fixation concerns. Anytime a user logs in or logs out, the session is regenerated (resulting in a new session ID).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| changelog was updated after the version was released. and finding that medium blog link from repo or npm module is not possible or easy.  I appreciate your efforts and response, but for such a popular module making it difficult for people to find changes and breaking changes feels reckless. You can also add some contributors from community, I think many people are ready to help in this. I am also ready to help if possible. |

| [@sushiljainam](https://github.com/sushiljainam) honestly it's on you for upgrading a non stable package without checking what changed first, don't come at the maintainer like that when you're clearly the one in the wrong  <https://semver.org/#spec-item-4>  Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable. |

| I agree to you [@tgroutars](https://github.com/tgroutars), but this module has gained so much popularity in its life of 11 years to still be in 0.y.z format. And you can see in Issues section of this repo, that many people are concerned about this same breaking change.  Also my suggestion, maintainer should add few more maintainers who can welcome community contributions faster as he gets less time, which is completely okay.  Anyway, I learned this new thing about version starting with 0 (0.y.z), So yeah, I'll take care in future. Thanks.  And Respect for [@jaredhanson](https://github.com/jaredhanson) for creating and maintaining such a popular OSS. |

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

#### Introduced: 20 May 2022

[CVE-2022-25896  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25896) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-384  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/384.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `passport` to version 0.6.0 or higher.

## Overview

[passport](https://www.npmjs.org/package/passport) is a Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Session Fixation. When a user logs in or logs out, the session is regenerated instead of being closed.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

4.8 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
