  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The software does not properly control the search path used to load resources, potentially allowing a malicious user to insert a crafted library or executable.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Escalation of privilege, enabling an attacker to gain higher level of access on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated user with local access and the ability to manipulate the search path."
