Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25188:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Fortify Plugin does not sanitize the `appName` and `appVersion` parameters of its Pipeline steps. These parameters are used to construct filenames for writing files in build directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of sanitization allows attackers to manipulate `appName` and `appVersion` to write files to arbitrary locations within the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers can write or overwrite `.xml` files on the Jenkins controller's file system. The content of these files is not directly controlled by the attacker, however this could be leveraged to cause disruption or other impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the use of the Fortify plugin's Pipeline steps, specifically through the `appName` and `appVersion` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs "Item/Configure" permission, which allows them to configure Pipeline jobs that use the Fortify Plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is fixed in Fortify Plugin version 20.2.35, which sanitizes the `appName` and `appVersion` parameters.
