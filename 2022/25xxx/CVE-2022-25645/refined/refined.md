{
  "CVE-2022-25645": {
    "description": "All versions of `dset` prior to 3.1.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via `dset/merge` mode. The `dset` function checks for prototype pollution by validating if the top-level path contains `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype`. By crafting a malicious object, it is possible to bypass this check and achieve prototype pollution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check for prototype pollution in the `dset/merge` function. It only validates the top-level path for `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`, allowing bypass via a crafted object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321)"
    ],
    "impact": "Prototype pollution can lead to denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it can tamper with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution. Property injection can also occur, where an attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious object, which may be done via a network request or similar, to the vulnerable function using the `dset/merge` mode. No privileges or user interaction is required.",
    "vulnerable_code": "The vulnerable code is located in the `src/merge.js` file of the dset library, specifically around line 9, where the recursive merge logic does not properly handle `__proto__` properties within nested objects.",
    "poc": [
      "```javascript\n// poc.js contains:\n\nconst {dset} = require(\"dset/merge\")\n\nvar a = {b:{c:1}}\n\nconsole.log(\"a.polluted:\",a.polluted)\nconsole.log(\"{}.polluted:\",({}).polluted)\n\ndset(a,\"b\", JSON.parse('{\"proto\":{\"polluted\":\"Yes!\"}}') ) //Needs to craft payload with JSON.parse to keep the object key proto\n\nconsole.log(\"a.polluted:\",a.polluted)\nconsole.log(\"{}.polluted:\",({}).polluted)\n\n// Running node poc.js give the output:\n\na.polluted: undefined\n{}.polluted: undefined\na.polluted: Yes!\n{}.polluted: Yes!\n```"

    "remediation": "Upgrade `dset` to version 3.1.2 or higher.",
