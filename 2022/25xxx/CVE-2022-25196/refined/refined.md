The provided content includes information about multiple vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins. Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-25196:

**CVE-2022-25196**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** GitLab Authentication Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.13 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin records the HTTP `Referer` header as part of the URL query parameters when the authentication process starts. After successful authentication, it redirects users to the URL specified in the `Referer` header.
*   **Weakness:** The plugin uses the `Referer` header without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that redirects users to an attacker-controlled site after they log in to Jenkins. This could potentially lead to phishing attacks or other forms of malicious activity.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a URL that includes a malicious redirect in the `Referer` header. When a user clicks on this link, the authentication process starts, and upon successful login, the user is redirected to the attacker-controlled URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs access to Jenkins to craft the malicious URL, which can then be delivered to a victim user via a separate channel (e.g., email, chat).
*   **Additional Information:** This vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for a previous security issue (SECURITY-796). There is no fix available at the time of the advisory publication.
