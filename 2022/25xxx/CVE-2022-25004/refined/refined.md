**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `id` parameter of the `/patients/view_patient.php` file in the Hospital Patient Record Management System v1.0.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed via the `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   Lack of Input Validation: The application uses the `id` parameter directly in SQL queries without validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Account Takeover: An attacker can potentially gain administrative control over the system through SQL injection
    *   Data Exfiltration: An attacker could download all information about this system via SQL injection.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET request: The `id` parameter in the `/patients/view_patient.php` URL is used as the injection point.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No further privilege is specified beyond that.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also contains links to GitHub repositories and to exploit details on 0day.today and vulners.com. It also mentions that an exploit for this vulnerability is for sale.
*   The vulnerability allows for both time-based blind SQL injection and error-based SQL injection.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

CVE-2022-25004 identifies a SQL injection vulnerability in the Hospital Patient Record Management System v1.0, specifically in the `/patients/view_patient.php` file's handling of the `id` parameter. This lack of input sanitization enables attackers to potentially gain full control over the application's database and sensitive information via SQL injection.
