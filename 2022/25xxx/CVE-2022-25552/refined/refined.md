Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function. The function copies a user-controlled string from the HTTP request parameter `ssid` to a stack buffer using `cmsUtl_strcpy` without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `cmsUtl_strcpy` function directly uses `strcpy` without checking the size of the input `ssid` parameter, allowing a larger-than-allocated string to overwrite the stack, leading to a stack overflow.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate the length of the `ssid` parameter received via the HTTP request before copying it into a stack buffer.
- **Insecure Function Usage:** Using `strcpy` without length checks is known to be an insecure practice, vulnerable to buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By sending a POST request to `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` with a long `ssid` parameter, an attacker can trigger the stack overflow and cause the device to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint.
- **`ssid` Parameter Manipulation:** The `ssid` parameter within the POST request body is the vector for the attack. By providing a long string for the `ssid` parameter, the stack overflow is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
-  The attacker needs to know the target endpoint `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` and the vulnerable parameter `ssid`.
- No specific authentication or prior access to the router is mentioned as a requirement to exploit the vulnerability in the provided information.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Tenda Router AX1806 v1.0.0.1.
- The vulnerable function is `form_fast_setting_wifi_set`.
- The vulnerable copy function is `cmsUtl_strcpy` which internally calls `strcpy`.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided in the form of an HTTP POST request.
