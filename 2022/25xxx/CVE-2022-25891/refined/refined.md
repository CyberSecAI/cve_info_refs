{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `util.PartitionMessage` function in github.com/containrrr/shoutrrr is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to an out-of-bounds read when processing messages of specific lengths (2000, 4000, or 6000 characters).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Denial of Service (DoS)",
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack can cause the service using the shoutrrr library to crash, leading to a denial of service. The service becomes unavailable to legitimate users.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted message of exactly 2000, 4000, or 6000 characters to the discord service, which utilizes the vulnerable `util.PartitionMessage` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send messages to a service that uses the vulnerable shoutrrr library and specifically uses the discord service."
