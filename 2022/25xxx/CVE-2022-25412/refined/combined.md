### **[fuzzyap1](/fuzzyap1)** commented [Feb 17, 2022](#issue-1141600693)

| Description of Vulnerability Multiple Arbitrary File Deletion vulnerabilities in maxsite cms v 180 targeted towards web admin through admin/plugins/admin\_page/all-files-update-ajax.php at the parameter dir and deletefile affected source code: at 15~34 in admin/plugins/admin\_page/all-files-update-ajax.php [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95869214/154530001-6fe62921-88d4-41e2-b6d0-261a3b6c041b.png)  when the unlink() function is called and user input might affect portions of or the whole affected parameter, which represents the path of the file to remove, without sufficient sanitization. Exploiting the vulnerability allows an attacker to delete any file in the web root (along with any other file on the server that the PHP process user has the proper permissions to delete). Proof of concept (Poc)  1. in <http://cms108.com/admin/page_edit/3> select file to delete and Send the request directly through burp    [image-20220216112514661](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95869214/154527950-1f72768e-2ce2-4ebd-b9e3-ffac8061ec90.png)    [image-20220216111841180](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95869214/154527978-c47b769c-5e38-450d-a36d-dd4fcb715356.png) 2. .You can traverse the directory to delete any file    [image-20220216112230772](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95869214/154528001-3cd15497-4c5e-4083-89db-98b8adfdd2f8.png) 3. (Poc)    `dir=../&deletefile=del-test.php`  Additional The same problem occurs in /cms-108/application/maxsite/admin/plugins/admin\_files/admin.php at the parameter f\_check\_files |
