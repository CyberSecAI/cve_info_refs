How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Blocks

This plugin provides 1 block.

* Spiffy Calendar Block

## Installation

1. Install the plugin from the WordPress repository in the usual way.
2. Activate the plugin on your WordPress plugins page
3. Configure Calendar using the following pages in the admin panel:

   Spiffy Calendar -> Events

   Spiffy Calendar -> Categories

   Spiffy Calendar -> Options
4. Edit or create a page on your blog which includes one of the shortcodes:

[spiffy-calendar] for the monthly calendar

[spiffy-minical] for the mini version of the monthly calendar

[spiffy-upcoming-list] for the upcoming events list

[spiffy-todays-list] for the list of today’s events

Add one of the spiffy widgets to your theme widget areas.

All of the shortcodes and widgets accept a comma separated list of category IDs, such as *cat\_list=’1,4′*. The category list must be a numeric list of the category number, not the category name.

The list shortcodes and widgets also accept an optional *limit* and *style* selection (Popup or Expanded). Popup is the default, classic style.

You can use the spiffy-upcoming-list expanded style shortcode in your MailPoet newsletter, with the following format (including arguments if needed):

[custom:spiffy-upcoming-list limit=4 …]

> If you are upgrading from Version 2 you will need to re-add your widgets after upgrading to Version 3.

## FAQ

### How do I change the starting day of week on my calendar?

The WordPress sitewide setting is used. See “Settings > General > Week starts on”.

### I updated/added/deleted an event and it is not reflected in my calendar. Why is this?

If you have a caching plugin, or if your theme has built-in caching, then you need to clear your cache for the areas where the calendar is displayed.

To replace a recurring event for one day. Simply create an event in the same category and date of the one being replaced and set it to ‘hide’. All events in the category selected will be hidden for the date(s) selected.
I put that first because apart from the fact that I couldn’t figure out how to suspend an event for a day I loved Spiffy Calendar. I love being able to set different colours to different categories and to add information (available on mouse hover) including pictures and web addresses.
Thanks Spiffy team. Thankyou support for responding so quickly too.
