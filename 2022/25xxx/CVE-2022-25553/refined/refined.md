Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack buffer overflow in the `formSetSysToolDDNS` function when handling the `ddnsPwd` parameter in the `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `ddnsPwd` parameter into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). By overflowing the stack buffer, the attacker can crash the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` page with an overly long `ddnsPwd` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Tenda router's web interface. This generally means they need to be on the same network as the router, or have a means of reaching it remotely.
- No authentication is mentioned, so it might be unauthenticated or exploitable even after authentication if the vulnerable code is reachable after login.
