- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unauthorized PAM user can access PAM configuration endpoints with read and write permissions when multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation due to insufficient access controls on PAM configuration endpoints.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious unauthorized user can access and modify the PAM administration configuration data, potentially leading to complete compromise of the PAM system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the PAM system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unauthorized PAM user, meaning they would have an account in the PAM system, but lack the necessary permissions.
