```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of `strdup` to copy the executable path obtained from `QStandardPaths::findExecutable`. If findExecutable returns an empty string, the code was previously handling it correctly. However, the modified code still calls strdup on empty string which leads to a crash.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code now unconditionally calls `strdup` on the result of `QFile::encodeName`. If `findExecutable` returns an empty path, the code will call `strdup` on an empty `QByteArray`. The behavior of `strdup` on an empty string is undefined and can lead to a crash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash when starting a process with an invalid program name, resulting in a denial-of-service.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by trying to start a process with a program name that cannot be found in PATH or is not an absolute path and passing an empty string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to control the program name passed to the `QProcess` object and the program name needs to not be present in `$PATH` or be an absolute path."
