Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25185:

**CVE-2022-25185: Stored XSS vulnerability in Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin does not properly escape the build cause for webhooks. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the build cause field.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input (the build cause), before displaying it on the web page. This lack of sanitization leads to the execution of malicious scripts when the page containing the unsanitized data is viewed.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view a build triggered by the malicious webhook. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies).
    *   Defacement of the Jenkins UI.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can exploit this by triggering a build with a malicious build cause via webhook. The injected malicious script is then stored and executed when the build details page is viewed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger builds using the webhook. This would likely involve having access to the Jenkins server or control over the system that is configured to send webhook events to the Jenkins server. The attacker requires at least Item/Configure permission. The impact requires user interaction (viewing the build page), making it a reflected XSS

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin versions 1.81 and earlier.
*   The fix is implemented in version 1.82 of the plugin.
* The vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.314 and earlier, LTS 2.303.1 and earlier.
