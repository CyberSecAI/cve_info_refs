Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-25173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `Pipeline: Groovy Plugin` (versions 2648.va9433432b33c and earlier) reuses the same workspace directory for checkouts of distinct SCMs (Source Code Management) when reading the script file (typically `Jenkinsfile`) for Pipelines. This means that if a job uses different SCMs, the plugin doesn't create a separate workspace per SCM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Workspace Sharing:** Reusing the same workspace for different SCM checkouts creates an opportunity for an attacker to influence the content of the workspace by manipulating an SCM.
- **OS Command Injection:** By controlling the contents of an SCM, an attacker can craft malicious scripts that are then executed on the Jenkins controller when the Pipeline reads the `Jenkinsfile` in that workspace.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the Jenkins controller. This is a critical vulnerability, as it allows the attacker to gain complete control over the Jenkins server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **SCM Content Manipulation:** The attacker needs to modify the contents of the SCM repository being used by the pipeline.
- **Pipeline Configuration:** The attacker needs the ability to configure a Jenkins Pipeline job to use a malicious SCM repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Item/Configure Permission:** The attacker needs "Item/Configure" permission for the specific Jenkins job to configure the SCM source to point to their malicious repository.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities affecting multiple Pipeline-related plugins.
- The fix for this vulnerability is in `Pipeline: Groovy Plugin` version 2656.vf7a_e7b_75a_457, which now uses distinct checkout directories per SCM.
