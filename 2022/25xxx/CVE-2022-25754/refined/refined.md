- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The integrated web server of the affected device is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of requests, which allows an attacker to perform actions on the device with the permissions of a victim user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to perform actions with the same privileges as the victim user, including potentially impacting the system.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can induce a victim user with an active session to trigger a malicious request, leading to the execution of actions with the victim's privileges on the targeted device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious request to a victim user, and the victim user needs to have an active session on the affected device. The attacker must also be adjacent to the affected device.
