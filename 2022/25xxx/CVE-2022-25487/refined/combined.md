| Thank you for taking the time to write this Issue for the project. It's very helpful for new users to understand some of the common problems they can face while developing a website on any platform.   ---   This is a very dangerous vulnerability, thanks for bringing it up.  I have found this [reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38712921/3808139) which I believe has good information on how to deal with uploads on PHP, but it's a very difficult topic so I'll recommend some more digging.  Remember that Atom.CMS is **not** meant to be used in production, and it should be used solely for learning PHP in a controlled environment.   ---   *I'm not the author or maintainer of this project, just someone who learned a lot from the YouTube series and is willing to help.* |
