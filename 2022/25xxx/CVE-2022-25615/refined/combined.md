How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

Hands down the best solution to integrate Zoom on your wp site. The support is phenomenal, they went above and beyond to fix PHP compatibility issue we were facing.

It is nice to have the possibilities to add zoom meetings directly in Wordpress. But actually the pro plugin offers very poor functionalities for the price. There is no possibility to add meetings automatically to a calendar. Also the layout of the meetings is not adaptable or very poor options to adjust to a corporate ID. Hopefully the eroom plugin team will add some new features, especially the automatization should be considered as this is what our clients want.
