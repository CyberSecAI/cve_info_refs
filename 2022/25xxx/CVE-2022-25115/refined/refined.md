Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of file extensions during profile picture uploads. The system does not correctly validate the type of file being uploaded allowing a malicious user to upload and execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files without proper validation of their content, specifically the file extension.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By uploading a file with a malicious extension and content (e.g. a PHP file), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize or validate file extensions, creating a pathway for malicious files to be uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This can lead to a full system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
- **System Manipulation:** The attacker can manipulate the system according to their malicious goals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Functionality:** The primary attack vector is through the user profile picture upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account:** An attacker needs an account (employee/user) on the system to access the profile picture upload functionality.
- **Malicious File:**  The attacker must possess or be able to create a file containing malicious code, disguised with a valid extension, but containing exploitable content (e.g. a PHP file for RCE).

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text references a specific system: "Home Owners Collection Management System 1.0".
