The provided content is related to several vulnerabilities in CentOS Web Panel, including those that lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Account Takeover, but doesn't directly reference CVE-2022-25046. Therefore, it's difficult to assess if it's the same vulnerability without further context of the CVE description.

However, based on the provided information, the following vulnerabilities are described:

**1. Pre-Auth RCE:**

*   **Root Cause:** Chaining a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability with a Command Injection vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** LFI and Command Injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution as root without prior authentication.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to the web panel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the web panel.
*  **Affected Versions:**  WebPanel Versions <= 0.9.8.1120

**2. Account Takeover:**

*   **Root Cause:** Predictable reset token generation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insecure password reset process.
*   **Impact:** Ability to reset the password of any user (except root) given their username and email, leading to account takeover.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Sending crafted password reset request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Knowledge of username and email address.

**3. Internal API Exposure:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of access control on internal API.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Exposed API functionalities without proper authentication.
*   **Impact:**  Ability to list, modify, and create accounts via API access.
*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the unprotected API via a crafted request or uploaded file
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A user account with the ability to host files (e.g. through the file manager).

**4. User Auth RCE:**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection in the `userlang` parameter during login.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution as root.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting commands in the userlang parameter during login.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Valid username and password (can be chained with the account takeover vulnerability).

**5. User Modules RCE:**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerabilities in multiple modules
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: Multiple command injection vulnerabilities in various modules.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution as root by leveraging module specific command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted POST requests to specific vulnerable modules.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Valid user credentials (can be chained with the account takeover vulnerability).
*  **Affected Versions:** WebPanel Versions <= 0.9.8.1124
**Vulnerable modules:**
    *   `mysql_manager&acc=optimizerdb`
    *   `disk_usage&acc=load_directory`
    *   `letsencrypt&acc=infomodal`
    *   `error_log&acc=select`

**Additional Information:**

*   The repository provides example scripts for exploiting these vulnerabilities.
*   Shodan search query provided to identify potentially vulnerable servers.

Given that the content provides information about multiple vulnerabilities in CentOS Web Panel, but doesn't contain specific details about CVE-2022-25046, it's difficult to establish if this information is relevant without a CVE description.
