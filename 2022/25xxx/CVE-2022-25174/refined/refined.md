The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25174.

**CVE-2022-25174** is associated with **SECURITY-2463** and is described as an OS command execution vulnerability in the Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries plugin.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries plugin, in versions 552.vd9cc05b8a2e1 and earlier, reuses the same workspace directory for checkouts of distinct SCMs when handling Pipeline libraries. This means that if a user checks out code from one source control repository and then checks out from another, the second check out will potentially overwrite the code from the first checkout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Workspace Reuse:** The plugin's failure to create distinct workspace directories for different SCM checkouts creates a vulnerability.
- **OS Command Execution:** This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands on the controller through carefully crafted SCM content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Jenkins controller with the same privileges as the Jenkins process. This can lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted SCM Content:** An attacker with "Item/Configure" permission can create or modify a Pipeline configuration to checkout from a malicious source control repository. The malicious repository could contain files that contain specially crafted code that allows command execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Item/Configure Permission:** The attacker must have "Item/Configure" permission for at least one Jenkins Pipeline job to modify the SCM settings.

**Affected Plugin and Versions:**
- **Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin:** Versions up to and including 552.vd9cc05b8a2e1 are affected.

**Fix:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 561.va\_ce0de3c2d69, which uses distinct checkout directories per SCM for Pipeline libraries.
