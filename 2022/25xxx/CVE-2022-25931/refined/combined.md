## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `easy-static-server`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to missing input sanitization and sandboxes being employed to the `req.url` user input that is passed to the server code.

## Details

A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:

* **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.

`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Ast%3A20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.

If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

```

**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

* **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.

One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```
2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

Path traversal vulnerability in easy-static-server@0.1.1

 [Raw](/lirantal/fdfbe26561788c8194a54bf6d31772c9/raw/9af21662798db9a2cd379cd593e69f410333b750/path-traversal-in-easy-static-server.md)

# Path traversal vulnerability in easy-static-server@0.1.1

`easy-static-server` is an HTTP file server, or as is it describes itself: `an easy server for static files`.

Observation:

* Virtually zero downloads, so no considerable impact.
* It was last published 6 years ago

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/cunjieliu/easyServer>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/easy-static-server>

## Background on exploitation

This file server library is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks due to
no input sanitization or other checks and sandboxes are employed to the
`req.url` user input that is passed to the server code.

Line 27 in `index.js`, as shown below, joins the `root` path of the
public directory with that of the path requested to access on the server
yet fails to resolve the path for any directory traversals and implement
security checks for the root directory bounds.

index.js (of easy-static-server@0.1.1):

```
		var file = path.join(root, url.parse(req.url).pathname);
		console.info(Date() + ": GET file:" + file);
		fs.exists(file, function(exists){
```

This vulnerability should probably be classified as a
[CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html): Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').

## Proof of Concept exploit

1. Install the latest version of `easy-static-server` (`npm install --save easy-static-server@0.1.1`)
2. Make sure you have a `public/` directory with files in it
3. Have an `server.js` file which uses this package API to serve files (see contents below)
4. Run the server `node server.js`
5. Confirm the server started on the default port of 3000
6. Send a request for files outside the static directory and confirm it is successful to employ a path traversal attack: `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../package.json` and observe the contents of the file returned back in the response

```

├── public
│   └── index.html

```
const server = require('easy-static-server');
server('./public');
