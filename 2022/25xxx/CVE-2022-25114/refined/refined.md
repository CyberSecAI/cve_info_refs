{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The system Event-management v1.0 is vulnerable to XSS-Reflected PHPSESSID hijacking because the parameter `full_name` from `register.php` is not sanitizing correctly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "XSS-Reflected, Improper Input Sanitization",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can take a `PHPSESSID` and use it to manipulate an already created login session of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `full_name` parameter of the `register.php` page. This code, when reflected back in the response, can be used to capture the victim's `PHPSESSID`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable `register.php` page with a malicious script in the `full_name` parameter. The attacker must then trick a victim into visiting the crafted URL and extract the session ID.",
