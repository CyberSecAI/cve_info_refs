Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-25590:

**CVE-2022-25590 is RELATED to the content provided.**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the logout logic of the SurveyKing application. Specifically, when a user logs out, the backend does not invalidate or delete the user's session. Instead, it only redirects the user to the login page. The user's session, including the JWT token, remains active and stored in the browser cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Persistence After Logout:** The primary weakness is that the user's session remains active even after clicking the logout button. The server does not invalidate the session token.
- **JWT Token Storage in Cookies:** The application uses JWT tokens which are stored in browser cookies. Since these cookies are not cleared during logout, they can be used to re-access the system.
- **Browser Cache Exploitation:** Attackers can leverage the browser's cache to reuse the previous user's JWT cookie to bypass login and gain access to the system if the user does not clear their browser data or the session times out.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to a user's account if they have access to the user's machine and the user has recently logged out without clearing their browser data.
- **Data Exposure:** The attacker could potentially access and modify sensitive data by gaining access to a user's session.
- **Session Hijacking:** A user's active session can be hijacked which can lead to more harmful attacks and impact the integrity and confidentiality of user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Cookie Reuse:** An attacker with access to the user's browser or system could directly reuse the JWT cookie from the browser to access the application.
- **Browser Cache Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit the browser cache, especially on shared computers, to reuse the token and log in as the previous user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to User's Machine or Browser:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the user's machine or browser that recently accessed the application and logged out.
- **Basic Browser Understanding:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of how browser cookies work and how they can be reused to access applications.

**Mitigation:**

The issue was resolved by removing the token cookie from the server side during logout, as stated by the developer in the issue comments.
```
The backend uses JWT. Currently, I don't want to use additional storage, such as a blacklist mechanism, just delete the token cookie from server now.
```
This ensures that the session is invalidated and the token is no longer valid after logout, preventing unauthorized access through cached cookies.
