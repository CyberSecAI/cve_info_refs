Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `id` parameter in `admin/maintenance/manage_branch.php` and `admin/maintenance/manage_fee.php` files. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code.
- Unauthenticated Access: The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users, meaning no login is required to exploit it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can potentially access sensitive data from the database. The provided exploit focuses on extracting user credentials but the impact is not limited to that
- Data Manipulation: Although not directly demonstrated in the exploit, the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries could also allow modification or deletion of database records.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No other special access is required.
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Money Transfer Management System".
- The exploit provided demonstrates how to extract data by constructing boolean-based SQL queries.
- The exploit uses a dictionary of characters to determine the length of the data and then extracts the actual data character by character.
- The vulnerability was discovered on 2022-02-15 and publicly disclosed on 2022-03-15
