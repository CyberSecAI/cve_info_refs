Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding within the Price Table plugin for WordPress, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, meaning an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious script injection:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to:
  - **Redirects:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - **Advertisements:** Displaying unwanted advertisements.
  - **HTML payload injection:** Injecting other harmful HTML content.
  - **Data theft:** Potentially stealing user cookies or session data
  - **Site takeover:** In some cases, successful XSS can be used to completely takeover a website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a page containing a vulnerable element.
- The attacker injects malicious scripts via user-supplied input or configuration settings of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to inject the malicious scripts. This might be through a vulnerable user-facing input or by manipulating plugin settings if they have sufficient privilege. 
- A user would then need to visit a page with the injected scripts to trigger the vulnerability.
-  The content indicates that "Contributor" privilege is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
