Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21802:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of the class name within the `Selector Manager` of the `grapesjs` library. This lack of proper sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which occurs because the application doesn't adequately sanitize user-provided input (class names) before rendering them on a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Stealing cookies:** Attackers can potentially steal cookies, which can be used to hijack user sessions.
- **Exposing sensitive information:** XSS can be used to expose sensitive information to the attacker.
- **Access to privileged services/functionality:** Exploitation could grant access to privileged services or functionalities that the attacker wouldn't normally have access to.
- **Malware delivery:** XSS can be used to deliver malware to users.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- The attacker can inject malicious code through the class name field in the `Selector Manager`, which is then rendered without proper sanitization, leading to XSS.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the crafted class names, which executes the malicious script in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker does not require any prior privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
-   The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious class name into the application's `Selector Manager`. This could be achieved through direct input into the application, or through other means that allow the attacker to manipulate this data.
- The user interaction is required in order to trigger the execution of the malicious script.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `grapesjs` versions prior to 0.19.5 and the fix was included in version 0.19.5.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the class names in `Selector Manager` to prevent XSS attacks.
*   The Snyk analysis highlights that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low complexity and no privileges required, however user interaction is required.
*   The provided GitHub commit (`13e85d152d486b968265c4b8017e8901e7d89ff3`) shows the specific changes made to address the XSS vulnerability, including changes in `src/selector_manager/view/ClassTagView.ts` and `src/selector_manager/view/ClassTagsView.ts` which indicates the sanitization was achieved by using template literals with html tags (html``)
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
