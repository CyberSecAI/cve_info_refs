JDK-8293429: [11u] minor update in attribute style ## Major Changes ###
[JDK-8278067](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8278067>): Make
HttpURLConnection Default Keep Alive Timeout Configurable Two system properties
have been added which control the keep alive behavior of HttpURLConnection in
the case where the server does not specify a keep alive time. Two properties are
defined for controlling connections to servers and proxies separately. They are:
\* `http.keepAlive.time.server` \* `http.keepAlive.time.proxy` respectively. More
information about them can be found on the [Networking Properties
page](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc->
files/net-properties.html). ### JDK-8286918: Better HttpServer service The
HttpServer can be optionally configured with a maximum connection limit by
setting the jdk.httpserver.maxConnections system property. A value of `0` or a
negative integer is ignored and considered to represent no connection limit. In
the case of a positive integer value, any newly accepted connections will be
first checked against the current count of established connections and, if the
configured limit has been reached, then the newly accepted connection will be
closed immediately. ###
[JDK-8281181](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8281181>): CPU Shares Ignored
When Computing Active Processor Count Previous JDK releases used an incorrect
interpretation of the Linux cgroups parameter "cpu.shares". This might cause the
JVM to use fewer CPUs than available, leading to an under utilization of CPU
resources when the JVM is used inside a container. Starting from this JDK
release, by default, the JVM no longer considers "cpu.shares" when deciding the
number of threads to be used by the various thread pools. The
`-XX:+UseContainerCpuShares` command-line option can be used to revert to the
previous behaviour. This option is deprecated and may be removed in a future JDK
release. ### [JDK-8269039](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8269039>):
Disabled SHA-1 Signed JARs JARs signed with SHA-1 algorithms are now restricted
by default and treated as if they were unsigned. This applies to the algorithms
used to digest, sign, and optionally timestamp the JAR. It also applies to the
signature and digest algorithms of the certificates in the certificate chain of
the code signer and the Timestamp Authority, and any CRLs or OCSP responses that
are used to verify if those certificates have been revoked. These restrictions
also apply to signed JCE providers. To reduce the compatibility risk for JARs
that have been previously timestamped, there is one exception to this policy: -
Any JAR signed with SHA-1 algorithms and timestamped prior to January 01, 2019
will not be restricted. This exception may be removed in a future JDK release.
To determine if your signed JARs are affected by this change, run: ~~~ $
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs` ~~~ on the signed JAR, and look for instances
of "SHA1" or "SHA-1" and "disabled" and a warning that the JAR will be treated
as unsigned in the output. For example: ~~~ Signed by "CN="Signer""
Digest algorithm: SHA-1 (disabled) Signature algorithm: SHA1withRSA
(disabled), 2048-bit key WARNING: The jar will be treated as unsigned,
because it is signed with a weak algorithm that is now disabled by the security
property: jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024, DSA
keySize < 1024, SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01 ~~~ JARs affected by these new
restrictions should be replaced or re-signed with stronger algorithms. Users
can, \*at their own risk\*, remove these restrictions by modifying the
`java.security` configuration file (or override it by using the
`java.security.properties` system property) and removing "SHA1 usage SignedJAR &
denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms` security
property and "SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms`
security property. ###
[JDK-8267880](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8267880>): Upgrade the default
PKCS12 MAC algorithm The default MAC algorithm used in a PKCS #12 keystore has
been updated. The new algorithm is based on SHA-256 and is stronger than the old
one based on SHA-1. See the security properties starting with `keystore.pkcs12`
in the `java.security` file for detailed information. The new SHA-256 based MAC
algorithms were introduced in the 11.0.12 release. Keystores created using this
newer, stronger, MAC algorithm cannot be opened in versions of OpenJDK 11
earlier than 11.0.12. A 'java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException' exception will
be thrown in such circumstances. For compatibility, use the
`keystore.pkcs12.legacy` system property, which will revert the algorithms to
use the older, weaker algorithms. There is no value defined for this property.
### [JDK-8261160](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8261160>): JDK Flight
Recorder Event for Deserialization It is now possible to monitor deserialization
of objects using JDK Flight Recorder (JFR). When JFR is enabled and the JFR
configuration includes deserialization events, JFR will emit an event whenever
the running program attempts to deserialize an object. The deserialization event
is named `jdk.Deserialization`, and it is disabled by default. The
deserialization event contains information that is used by the serialization
filter mechanism; see the ObjectInputFilter API specification for details.
Additionally, if a filter is enabled, the JFR event indicates whether the filter
accepted or rejected deserialization of the object. For further information
about how to use the JFR deserialization event, see the article "[Monitoring
Deserialization to Improve Application
Security](<https://inside.java/2021/03/02/monitoring-deserialization-activity-in->
the-jdk/)". For reference information about using and configuring JFR, see the
"[JFR Runtime Guide](<https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-5/jfr-runtime->
guide/preface\_jfrrt.htm#JFRRT165)" and "[JFR Command
Reference](<https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-5/jfr-command->
reference/command-line-options.htm#JFRCR-GUID-
FE61CA60-E1DF-460E-A8E0-F4FF5D58A7A0)" sections of the JDK Mission Control
documentation. ### [JDK-8139348](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8139348>):
Deprecate 3DES and RC4 in Kerberos The `des3-hmac-sha1` and `rc4-hmac` Kerberos
encryption types (etypes) are now deprecated and disabled by default. Users can
set `allow\_weak\_crypto = true` in the `krb5.conf` configuration file to re-
enable them (along with other weak etypes including `des-cbc-crc` and `des-cbc-
md5`) at their own risk. To disable a subset of the weak etypes, users can list
preferred etypes explicitly in any of the `default\_tkt\_enctypes`,
`default\_tgs\_enctypes`, or `permitted\_enctypes` settings.

4.4.1 - JDK-8290334: Update FreeType to 2.12.1 ## Major Changes ###
[JDK-8278067](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8278067>): Make
HttpURLConnection Default Keep Alive Timeout Configurable Two system properties
have been added which control the keep alive behavior of HttpURLConnection in
the case where the server does not specify a keep alive time. Two properties are
defined for controlling connections to servers and proxies separately. They are:
\* `http.keepAlive.time.server` \* `http.keepAlive.time.proxy` respectively. More
information about them can be found on the [Networking Properties
page](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc->
files/net-properties.html). ### JDK-8286918: Better HttpServer service The
HttpServer can be optionally configured with a maximum connection limit by
setting the jdk.httpserver.maxConnections system property. A value of `0` or a
negative integer is ignored and considered to represent no connection limit. In
the case of a positive integer value, any newly accepted connections will be
first checked against the current count of established connections and, if the
configured limit has been reached, then the newly accepted connection will be
closed immediately. ###
[JDK-8281181](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8281181>): CPU Shares Ignored
When Computing Active Processor Count Previous JDK releases used an incorrect
interpretation of the Linux cgroups parameter "cpu.shares". This might cause the
JVM to use fewer CPUs than available, leading to an under utilization of CPU
resources when the JVM is used inside a container. Starting from this JDK
release, by default, the JVM no longer considers "cpu.shares" when deciding the
number of threads to be used by the various thread pools. The
`-XX:+UseContainerCpuShares` command-line option can be used to revert to the
previous behaviour. This option is deprecated and may be removed in a future JDK
release. ### [JDK-8269039](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8269039>):
Disabled SHA-1 Signed JARs JARs signed with SHA-1 algorithms are now restricted
by default and treated as if they were unsigned. This applies to the algorithms
used to digest, sign, and optionally timestamp the JAR. It also applies to the
signature and digest algorithms of the certificates in the certificate chain of
the code signer and the Timestamp Authority, and any CRLs or OCSP responses that
are used to verify if those certificates have been revoked. These restrictions
also apply to signed JCE providers. To reduce the compatibility risk for JARs
that have been previously timestamped, there is one exception to this policy: -
Any JAR signed with SHA-1 algorithms and timestamped prior to January 01, 2019
will not be restricted. This exception may be removed in a future JDK release.
To determine if your signed JARs are affected by this change, run: ~~~ $
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs` ~~~ on the signed JAR, and look for instances
of "SHA1" or "SHA-1" and "disabled" and a warning that the JAR will be treated
as unsigned in the output. For example: ~~~ Signed by "CN="Signer""
Digest algorithm: SHA-1 (disabled) Signature algorithm: SHA1withRSA
(disabled), 2048-bit key WARNING: The jar will be treated as unsigned,
because it is signed with a weak algorithm that is now disabled by the security
property: jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024, DSA
keySize < 1024, SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01 ~~~ JARs affected by these new
restrictions should be replaced or re-signed with stronger algorithms. Users
can, \*at their own risk\*, remove these restrictions by modifying the
`java.security` configuration file (or override it by using the
`java.security.properties` system property) and removing "SHA1 usage SignedJAR &
denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms` security
property and "SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms`
security property.

[JDK-8278067](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8278067>): Make
HttpURLConnection Default Keep Alive Timeout Configurable Two system properties
have been added which control the keep alive behavior of HttpURLConnection in
the case where the server does not specify a keep alive time. Two properties are
defined for controlling connections to servers and proxies separately. They are:
\* `http.keepAlive.time.server` \* `http.keepAlive.time.proxy` respectively. More
information about them can be found on the [Networking Properties
page](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc->
files/net-properties.html). ### JDK-8286918: Better HttpServer service The
HttpServer can be optionally configured with a maximum connection limit by
setting the jdk.httpserver.maxConnections system property. A value of `0` or a
negative integer is ignored and considered to represent no connection limit. In
the case of a positive integer value, any newly accepted connections will be
first checked against the current count of established connections and, if the
configured limit has been reached, then the newly accepted connection will be
closed immediately. ###
[JDK-8281181](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8281181>): CPU Shares Ignored
When Computing Active Processor Count Previous JDK releases used an incorrect
interpretation of the Linux cgroups parameter "cpu.shares". This might cause the
JVM to use fewer CPUs than available, leading to an under utilization of CPU
resources when the JVM is used inside a container. Starting from this JDK
release, by default, the JVM no longer considers "cpu.shares" when deciding the
number of threads to be used by the various thread pools. The
`-XX:+UseContainerCpuShares` command-line option can be used to revert to the
previous behaviour. This option is deprecated and may be removed in a future JDK
release. ### [JDK-8269039](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8269039>):
Disabled SHA-1 Signed JARs JARs signed with SHA-1 algorithms are now restricted
by default and treated as if they were unsigned. This applies to the algorithms
used to digest, sign, and optionally timestamp the JAR. It also applies to the
signature and digest algorithms of the certificates in the certificate chain of
the code signer and the Timestamp Authority, and any CRLs or OCSP responses that
are used to verify if those certificates have been revoked. These restrictions
also apply to signed JCE providers. To reduce the compatibility risk for JARs
that have been previously timestamped, there is one exception to this policy: -
Any JAR signed with SHA-1 algorithms and timestamped prior to January 01, 2019
will not be restricted. This exception may be removed in a future JDK release.
To determine if your signed JARs are affected by this change, run: ~~~ $
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs` ~~~ on the signed JAR, and look for instances
of "SHA1" or "SHA-1" and "disabled" and a warning that the JAR will be treated
as unsigned in the output. For example: ~~~ Signed by "CN="Signer""
Digest algorithm: SHA-1 (disabled) Signature algorithm: SHA1withRSA
(disabled), 2048-bit key WARNING: The jar will be treated as unsigned,
because it is signed with a weak algorithm that is now disabled by the security
property: jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024, DSA
keySize < 1024, SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01 ~~~ JARs affected by these new
restrictions should be replaced or re-signed with stronger algorithms. Users
can, \*at their own risk\*, remove these restrictions by modifying the
`java.security` configuration file (or override it by using the
`java.security.properties` system property) and removing "SHA1 usage SignedJAR &
denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms` security
property and "SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms`
security property.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 370 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2900500.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/). A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Database Server Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Database Products.  1 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Database Server installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2022verbose.html#DB)

Oracle has released client Database fixes for CVEs which we believe are not exploitable in the context of the Database. The Database server includes a full copy of all the client bits, so any patch that is client applicable, also has to be applied on the server side.

JDK-8293429: [11u] minor update in attribute style ## Major Changes ###
[JDK-8278067](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8278067>): Make
HttpURLConnection Default Keep Alive Timeout Configurable Two system properties
have been added which control the keep alive behavior of HttpURLConnection in
the case where the server does not specify a keep alive time. Two properties are
defined for controlling connections to servers and proxies separately. They are:
\* `http.keepAlive.time.server` \* `http.keepAlive.time.proxy` respectively. More
information about them can be found on the [Networking Properties
page](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc->
files/net-properties.html). ### JDK-8286918: Better HttpServer service The
HttpServer can be optionally configured with a maximum connection limit by
setting the jdk.httpserver.maxConnections system property. A value of `0` or a
negative integer is ignored and considered to represent no connection limit. In
the case of a positive integer value, any newly accepted connections will be
first checked against the current count of established connections and, if the
configured limit has been reached, then the newly accepted connection will be
closed immediately. ###
[JDK-8281181](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8281181>): CPU Shares Ignored
When Computing Active Processor Count Previous JDK releases used an incorrect
interpretation of the Linux cgroups parameter "cpu.shares". This might cause the
JVM to use fewer CPUs than available, leading to an under utilization of CPU
resources when the JVM is used inside a container. Starting from this JDK
release, by default, the JVM no longer considers "cpu.shares" when deciding the
number of threads to be used by the various thread pools. The
`-XX:+UseContainerCpuShares` command-line option can be used to revert to the
previous behaviour. This option is deprecated and may be removed in a future JDK
release. ### [JDK-8269039](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8269039>):
Disabled SHA-1 Signed JARs JARs signed with SHA-1 algorithms are now restricted
by default and treated as if they were unsigned. This applies to the algorithms
used to digest, sign, and optionally timestamp the JAR. It also applies to the
signature and digest algorithms of the certificates in the certificate chain of
the code signer and the Timestamp Authority, and any CRLs or OCSP responses that
are used to verify if those certificates have been revoked. These restrictions
also apply to signed JCE providers. To reduce the compatibility risk for JARs
that have been previously timestamped, there is one exception to this policy: -
Any JAR signed with SHA-1 algorithms and timestamped prior to January 01, 2019
will not be restricted. This exception may be removed in a future JDK release.
To determine if your signed JARs are affected by this change, run: ~~~ $
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs` ~~~ on the signed JAR, and look for instances
of "SHA1" or "SHA-1" and "disabled" and a warning that the JAR will be treated
as unsigned in the output. For example: ~~~ Signed by "CN="Signer""
Digest algorithm: SHA-1 (disabled) Signature algorithm: SHA1withRSA
(disabled), 2048-bit key WARNING: The jar will be treated as unsigned,
because it is signed with a weak algorithm that is now disabled by the security
property: jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024, DSA
keySize < 1024, SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01 ~~~ JARs affected by these new
restrictions should be replaced or re-signed with stronger algorithms. Users
can, \*at their own risk\*, remove these restrictions by modifying the
`java.security` configuration file (or override it by using the
`java.security.properties` system property) and removing "SHA1 usage SignedJAR &
denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms` security
property and "SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms`
security property. ###
[JDK-8267880](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8267880>): Upgrade the default
PKCS12 MAC algorithm The default MAC algorithm used in a PKCS #12 keystore has
been updated. The new algorithm is based on SHA-256 and is stronger than the old
one based on SHA-1. See the security properties starting with `keystore.pkcs12`
in the `java.security` file for detailed information. The new SHA-256 based MAC
algorithms were introduced in the 11.0.12 release. Keystores created using this
newer, stronger, MAC algorithm cannot be opened in versions of OpenJDK 11
earlier than 11.0.12. A 'java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException' exception will
be thrown in such circumstances. For compatibility, use the
`keystore.pkcs12.legacy` system property, which will revert the algorithms to
use the older, weaker algorithms. There is no value defined for this property.
### [JDK-8261160](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8261160>): JDK Flight
Recorder Event for Deserialization It is now possible to monitor deserialization
of objects using JDK Flight Recorder (JFR). When JFR is enabled and the JFR
configuration includes deserialization events, JFR will emit an event whenever
the running program attempts to deserialize an object. The deserialization event
is named `jdk.Deserialization`, and it is disabled by default. The
deserialization event contains information that is used by the serialization
filter mechanism; see the ObjectInputFilter API specification for details.
Additionally, if a filter is enabled, the JFR event indicates whether the filter
accepted or rejected deserialization of the object. For further information
about how to use the JFR deserialization event, see the article "[Monitoring
Deserialization to Improve Application
Security](<https://inside.java/2021/03/02/monitoring-deserialization-activity-in->
the-jdk/)". For reference information about using and configuring JFR, see the
"[JFR Runtime Guide](<https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-5/jfr-runtime->
guide/preface\_jfrrt.htm#JFRRT165)" and "[JFR Command
Reference](<https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-5/jfr-command->
reference/command-line-options.htm#JFRCR-GUID-
FE61CA60-E1DF-460E-A8E0-F4FF5D58A7A0)" sections of the JDK Mission Control
documentation. ### [JDK-8139348](<https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8139348>):
Deprecate 3DES and RC4 in Kerberos The `des3-hmac-sha1` and `rc4-hmac` Kerberos
encryption types (etypes) are now deprecated and disabled by default. Users can
set `allow\_weak\_crypto = true` in the `krb5.conf` configuration file to re-
enable them (along with other weak etypes including `des-cbc-crc` and `des-cbc-
md5`) at their own risk. To disable a subset of the weak etypes, users can list
preferred etypes explicitly in any of the `default\_tkt\_enctypes`,
`default\_tgs\_enctypes`, or `permitted\_enctypes` settings.
