Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-21747:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `imgsensor` component. This leads to a potential out-of-bounds read.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation (CWE-20) due to the lack of bounds checking on input data within the `imgsensor` component. This enables an out-of-bounds read.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could result in a local denial of service (DoS).
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is local, meaning the attacker needs to have a local presence on the device.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have System execution privileges to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is not required for exploitation.
*   **Affected Chipsets**: MT6771, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6833, MT6853, MT6873, MT6885, MT6893, MT8167, MT8167S, MT8168, MT8173, MT8362A, MT8365, MT8765, MT8766, MT8768, MT8786, MT8788, MT8789, MT8797
*   **Affected Software Versions:** Android 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, and 12.0.
