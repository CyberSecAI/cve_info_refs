- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write due to a missing bounds check when decoding GPRS Packet Neighbour Cell Data (PNCD) with improper neighbouring cell size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Decoding a malformed GPRS Packet Neighbour Cell Data (PNCD) with an improper neighboring cell size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No additional execution privileges or user interaction needed. Exploitation can occur remotely by sending a crafted GPRS packet.
