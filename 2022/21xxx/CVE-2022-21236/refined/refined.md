- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A web server misconfiguration in the Reolink RLC-410W camera places the TLS private key within the document root, and there are insufficient access controls, allowing unauthorized access to the key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Information Disclosure: The TLS private key is directly accessible via an HTTP request due to being located in the web server's document root.
    - Insufficient Access Control: The web server does not prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files within the document root.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Impersonation: An attacker can use the exposed TLS private key to impersonate the camera.
    - Decryption of HTTPS Traffic: An attacker can decrypt HTTPS traffic, potentially stealing authentication tokens.
    - Privilege Escalation: Stealing authentication tokens can lead to an attacker gaining admin privileges.
    - Device compromise: With admin access, an attacker can affect the integrity and availability of the device using the Reolink API.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the camera's web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the camera on the network.
