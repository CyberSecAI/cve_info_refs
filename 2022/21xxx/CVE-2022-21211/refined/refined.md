**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `toString` method of an object passed to a `posix` function is not checked if it's a function before being invoked. If it is not a function, it falls back to a `0x0` value. This leads to a type-check crash when that value is used in operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper type checking of the `toString` method leading to a type-check error, causing the application to crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The application crashes, becoming unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Passing an object with a non-function `toString` method to a `posix` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the arguments passed to a vulnerable posix function call, where they can provide an object with a non-function `toString` property. This could potentially be exploited remotely if the input of the vulnerable function is controlled by the attacker through a network interface.
