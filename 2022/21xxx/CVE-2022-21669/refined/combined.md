# Pudding

Welcome to [@PuddingBot](https://t.me/puddingbot), my AGPL3 licensed group management bot.

More information and a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) powered manual will be added at a later date.

## Why not just use Rose?

There are certain things bothering me about the design philosophy of Rose that I seek to avoid.

* It's closed source.
* Rose never warns that a filter has already been set, instead replacing it silently.
* Rose's anti-flooding is broken. It doesn't allow an admin to set the time frame between messages that are considered flooding, and the default setting isn't sensible.
* "Disables" are non-admin only. There should be a functionality to disable parts of the bot entirely.
* No way to query the reason a user was banned/muted. Rose support suggests running a log channel for that, which is additional hassle.
* Some other gimmicks like conveniently displaying a chat's basic information (title, description, ID, @ and invite link) or querying the bot's uptime are
  absent.

| Bot token was accidentally exposed in [main.py](https://github.com/PuddingBot/pudding-bot/blob/a66822767018a09d305cce0da45fa912cd3d57f8/main.py#L180).  Resolution:   * Revoke token and generate a new one. * Remove comment line with old, now non-functional token. * Implement a mechanism to prevent accidentally sharing credentials in the future. * ~~Replace *file\_id* in [about.py](https://github.com/PuddingBot/pudding-bot/blob/a66822767018a09d305cce0da45fa912cd3d57f8/about.py#L6).~~   + Use [pudding-bot-assets](https://puddingbot.github.io/pudding-bot-assets/About.gif) instead. |

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
