- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within DirectComposition, leading to a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information and escalate privileges, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access and the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
