## 0.17.0

Mark Text is now MarkText! We'd like to thank all contributors and users that have been using MarkText and worked on this release.

**‚ö†Ô∏èBreaking Changes:**

* Changed multiple default key bindings.
* Changed key binding handling: all key bindings are now mapped to the corresponding US key bindings. E.g. `Ctrl+Shift+7` on a German keyboard will now produce `Ctrl+/` because `Shift+7` is equivalent to `/`.
* Image uploader: SM.MS was removed, GitHub uploader is deprecated and will be replaced by PicGo in our next release.

**üåµFeature**

* Added support for image path variables.
* Added command-line image uploader and reworked settings.
* Added regular expression group replacement to searcher.
* Added PlantUML diagram support.
* Added support for chemical equations in math mode.
* Added automatic call to search for find-in-file when the pane is opened.
* Open local non-markdown files in default application.
* Added support to use all menu entries for key binding.
* Added window zoom via default mouse event.
* Zoom level is now restored on startup.
* Added PicGo to upload images.
* Ability to invalidate image cache on demand.
* Added settings page to configure key bindings.

**ü¶ãOptimization**

* Improved inline markdown autocomplete support.
* Improved preference design.
* Relative image paths are now converted to forward slashes on Windows for better compatibility.
* Center sidebar image when no search results are available.
* Updated emoji database.
* Improved sidebar file handling UX by providing more error messages.

**ü™≤Bug fix**

* Fixed an issue with code block cursor positioning.
* Fixed invalid mermaid diagram representation when exporting as PDF.
* Fixed rendering issue with LaTeX formulas
* Fixed an issue that may caused editor flickering while pressing `Enter`.
* Fixed Table of Contents sidebar display issue.
* Fixed editor overflow when the sidbar is open.
* Fixed a crash that occurred due to a bug in the markdown footnote parser.
* Fixed issue with shortcuts that included `Alt`.
* Fixed multiple issues on non-US keyboards.
* Normalized source-code editor cursor.
* Fixed preference scaling issue and added missing scrollbar.
* Fixed a rendering issue when multiple elements were selected via keyboard.
* Fixed preference migrations were always executed on start-up.
* Fixed scrolling and search match positing with high DPI scaling.
* Fixed slow startup on Windows due to a blocking call.
* Fixed an issue that caused the paste handler to insert only HTML content if HTML rendering was disabled.
* Fixed file rename with editor dialog.
* Fixed URL open handler when clicking a link in the editor.
* Fixed an issue that prevented to unindent a list item.
* Fixed multiple XSS issues on language selector and data input.
