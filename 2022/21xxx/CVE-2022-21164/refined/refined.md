Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-21164

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper type checking when handling the `toString` property within the `node-lmdb` library. Specifically, the `putString` function within a transaction does not validate if the provided `toString` property is a function. If the property is not a function, it leads to a crash due to a type mismatch during data processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect Type Handling:** The code assumes the existence of a valid `toString` function without proper verification.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The library fails to validate the type of the `toString` property of an object being passed to `putString`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation results in a crash, rendering the affected service or application unavailable to legitimate users. This is explicitly noted as a Denial of Service vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted Input:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted object with a non-function `toString` property when calling the `putString` method of a transaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to interact with the `node-lmdb` library and call the `putString` function with a crafted object. No special privileges are required. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable as the library may be used in network facing applications.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `putString` function of the `txn.cpp` file, as shown in the provided GitHub commit diff.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by creating a database environment, opening a database, starting a transaction and then attempting to store a string value with the `toString` property set to a non-invokable value (integer 1), resulting in a crash.
*   The fix (from the Github commit) adds a check to ensure the value to be put is a string, avoiding this crash

**Additional Notes:**
* The Snyk information provides additional context including CVSS scores, EPSS score, and references to the Github commit fixing the vulnerability.
*   The Snyk report also categorizes this as a crash type DoS, and explains more generally what DoS attacks are, and some common variants
*   The CVSS score from Snyk (3.7 low) differs from the NVD score (7.5 High)
