- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ucloud_add_node_new` function in the `confsrv` service of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `serialNumMd5` field of a protobuf message into a system command without proper sanitization or escaping.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-78). The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through the `serialNumMd5` field.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution on the affected device. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device, allowing for data theft, malware installation, denial-of-service attacks, or other malicious activities.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to send a specially crafted network packet to port 9003 of the LinkHub Mesh Wifi, while being on the Wi-Fi network provided by the device. The packet must contain a `ManualNodeInfo` protobuf message with a malicious `serialNumMd5` string.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the vulnerable TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi device. They also need the capability to craft and send network packets to the device's port 9003.
