{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `num_threads` argument in the `ThreadPoolHandle` implementation was not properly validated, allowing for an excessively large number of threads to be specified which would result in excessive memory allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unbounded resource allocation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to excessive memory allocation, leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `tf.raw_ops.ThreadPoolHandle` with a large `num_threads` argument.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to execute TensorFlow code and call `tf.raw_ops.ThreadPoolHandle` with a large number of threads."
