- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the power service due to a missing bounds check when copying data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where data is written past the allocated buffer. Specifically, a "buffer copy without checking size of input" occurs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to local escalation of privilege. This means an attacker can gain elevated permissions on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited locally through the power service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the device with System execution privileges, but user interaction is not required for exploitation.
