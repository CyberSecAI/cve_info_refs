Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21727:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the shape inference implementation of the `Dequantize` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the `axis` attribute of the `Dequantize` op is not properly validated against the dimensions of the input tensor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates `axis + 1` without checking if `axis` is close enough to `INT_MAX`. This allows an attacker to provide a large `axis` value, causing an integer overflow.
- **Missing Upper Bound Check:** The code checks if `axis < -1`, but doesn't check for a maximum allowed value based on the input tensor's rank, thus leading to a potential overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The integer overflow could lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access during shape inference.
- The provided code example implies that it's possible to trigger the overflow during graph construction.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a crafted TensorFlow graph using the `Dequantize` operation with a large value for the `axis` parameter, such that `axis + 1` overflows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to define and execute TensorFlow graphs or have the ability to influence the parameters of the `Dequantize` operation.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the file `tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc`.
- The fix involves adding an additional check to ensure that the `axis` value is less than the number of input dimensions, as well as adding an explicit check to prevent integer overflow at kint32max
- The fix is available in TensorFlow versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1, and 2.8.0 and later.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.
