Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-21209

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing FPJ files within Fatek Automation's FvDesigner software. Specifically, the software does not properly check the length of the provided data before using it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to read data from a memory location beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer. The software reads past the end of an allocated buffer due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.
*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (mentioned in one advisory, but not for CVE-2022-21209):** One of the advisories mentions a stack-based buffer overflow. It arises due to the lack of proper length validation of user-supplied data before copying it to a stack buffer. This is described for CVE-2022-25170. This is different from out-of-bounds read that is described for CVE-2022-21209

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running FvDesigner, which could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious FPJ File:** The attacker crafts a malicious FPJ file. The user has to open it using the vulnerable software.
*   **Malicious Page:** The advisory mentions that user interaction is required, such as visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create or deliver a malicious FPJ file to the target user.
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in FvDesigner versions 1.5.100 and prior.
*   FATEK has released an update to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely
*   The vulnerability is considered to have low attack complexity.
*   CVSS score is 7.8 with vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   Multiple researchers are credited with reporting different vulnerabilities in the software.
