Hey People,
this release is fixing 4 security problems with 2.10 and you should
update your installations as fast as possible.
## Fixed Issues
1. Fix XML external entity (XXE) injection with xmlhash gem (CVE-2022-21949)
One of the Ruby gems we are using to parse XML was susceptible to this
kind of attack.
[https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML\_External\_Entity\_(XXE)\_Pr...](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing)
This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of
service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective
of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.
2. Fix a privilege escalation issue in ProjectDoProjectReleaseJob.
<https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/12407>
This has only minor impact as an attacker would have to time job
scheduling, which is next to impossible.
3. Fix heap memory corruption in the yajl-ruby gem
For details see
[https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-jj47-x69x-m...](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-jj47-x69x-mxrm)
4. Fix excessive backtracking in the nokogiri gem
For details see
[https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-crjr-9rc5...](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-crjr-9rc5-ghw8)
## Ruby 2.7
We have changed the ruby interpreter which requires a manual step when
updating from a previous OBS version via packages:
1) Change Passenger to use ruby2.7
edit /etc/apache2/conf.d/mod\_passenger.conf:
PassengerRuby "/usr/bin/ruby.ruby2.7"
2) Setup the rake alternative if you have multiple rake versions
installed
update-alternatives --set rake /usr/bin/rake.ruby.ruby2.7
3) Restart apache2 service
systemctl restart apache2
## How to Update
Package updates are available from the 2.10 repositories
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/OBS:Server:2.10](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/OBS%3AServer%3A2.10)

| [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c8)  Victor Pereira   2022-04-04 18:56:21 UTC  ``` Coolo created a fix for that <https://github.com/coolo/xmlhash/commit/544e614e2674ad26b97a234baa013723c829b751>  We updated our codebase and deployed it already. Next step is to check if it was the only necessary change and then apply the changes to the branch 2.10 too. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c9)  Adrian Schröter   2022-04-05 06:15:52 UTC  ``` it is not a bug in libxml2 per se, it is a long standing poor default. But you would break tooling (not OBS related) if behaving different now and disable external entities by default. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c10)  Stephan Kulow   2022-04-05 06:31:43 UTC  ``` It's not even the default - it's very bad API documentation that not only I fell over. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2022-04-05 06:56:39 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-21949. For now just one CVE, I might split this up later on to track individual cases. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c12)  Johannes Segitz   2022-04-05 14:34:25 UTC  ``` I can extract the secret.key with this to alter the session cookies. Still working on a full exploit for this ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c13)  Victor Pereira   2022-04-06 08:50:37 UTC  ``` Could you please check if the issues are still present on master or production Johannes? With the patches applied with the commit 68a0e354193b3b9da513676d20fbf3a28ceac0ff all the issues reported in this bug are gone. The patches are already in production, and in the repository 2.10 (used by our appliance), however we still didn't release a new version for that. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c15)  Johannes Segitz   2022-04-06 11:23:20 UTC  ``` Who's responsible for releasing the appliances? Also we should sent out an advisory to notify build service admins of the issue since it's pretty severe. I can help draft it if needed ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c17)  Adrian Schröter   2022-04-06 11:25:30 UTC  ``` appliances get released together with the packages usually, they are part of testing and building inside of the same project. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c19)  Victor Pereira   2022-04-06 12:17:57 UTC  ``` After some further research, the REXML doesn’t support expanding SYSTEM entity. So REXML doesn’t have vulnerability related external content. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c20)  Johannes Segitz   2022-04-07 13:09:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adrian Schröter from [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c17)) okay good thanks. Do we have a good communications channel to inform downstream users of the issue? I think we should do more instead of just mentioning this in the changes ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c21)  Hendrik Vogelsang   2022-04-08 10:28:22 UTC  ``` Downstream users are supposed to use our releases. We are going to do a release of 2.10. As usual they are announced on our blog & mailing list. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c22)  Johannes Segitz   2022-04-08 11:20:46 UTC  ``` please make sure to make clear in the announcement how import this update is ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c23)  Hendrik Vogelsang   2022-04-19 15:32:14 UTC  ``` Release is on it's way....  <https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/12455> ``` [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c24)  Marcus Meissner   2022-04-20 12:18:18 UTC  ``` is now public  [https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/buildservice@lists.opensuse.org/thread/JN52NSNX4QBD2SRYPGWBA5LEVCCDISQG/](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/buildservice%40lists.opensuse.org/thread/JN52NSNX4QBD2SRYPGWBA5LEVCCDISQG/) ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c25)  Ruediger Oertel   2022-04-20 12:34:42 UTC  ``` b.s.c updated. ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c26)  Marcus Meissner   2022-04-20 15:39:10 UTC  ``` I rated CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1197928#c27)  Johannes Segitz   2022-05-03 07:47:09 UTC  ``` published the CVE ``` |  |
