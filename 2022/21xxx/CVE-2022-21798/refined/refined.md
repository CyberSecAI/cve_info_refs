- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of credentials over the network in GE's Proficy CIMPLICITY HMI and SCADA platform.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). This allows an attacker to capture the unencrypted credentials transmitted over the network.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to capture a connection session, which leads to the disclosure of sensitive information, and potentially log in to the system to make operational changes.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity, specifically via a network adjacent to the affected system. An attacker can eavesdrop on network traffic to intercept the cleartext credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network (adjacent) where the vulnerable CIMPLICITY system is running to eavesdrop and capture the traffic containing the cleartext credentials. No special privileges are required.
