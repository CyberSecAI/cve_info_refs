Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21730:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` implementation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code doesn't validate input tensors, particularly the `row_pooling_sequence` and `col_pooling_sequence`. When negative values are present in these sequences, it can lead to out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap out-of-bounds (OOB) read:** The core weakness is the possibility of reading data from outside the allocated memory region on the heap. This is triggered when negative values are supplied in the pooling sequences.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code fails to check if the values in `row_pooling_sequence` and `col_pooling_sequence` are valid (non-negative) before using them to access memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary memory contents from the heap. This could expose sensitive information, including potentially other data in the same process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to craft malicious input tensors that contain negative values in either `row_pooling_sequence` or `col_pooling_sequence` and pass them to the `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` operation.
- The provided python code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply crafted input to the vulnerable `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` operation, suggesting the attacker is able to interact with a tensorflow model that uses this operation.
- There is no need for the attacker to be in a privileged position.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1 and will be included in 2.8.0.
- The provided GitHub commit ([002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9)) introduces checks to ensure that the values in the sequence tensors are not negative, and also includes tests that reproduce the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.
- The severity is rated as moderate.
