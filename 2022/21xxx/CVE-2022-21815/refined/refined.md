- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A NULL pointer dereference in the kernel. This dereference is created within user mode code, during the handling of private IOCTLs in the `nvlddmkm.sys` kernel mode layer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of user-mode input leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service in the form of a system crash.
- **Attack vectors:**  Local attacker, using user-mode code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction is required.
