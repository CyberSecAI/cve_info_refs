The provided content is related to CVE-2022-21650.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Convos application did not properly handle HTML file uploads, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, while SVG files were blocked, HTML files could be uploaded and served by the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization/validation on HTML file uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute malicious scripts within the context of the Convos application.
- This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker uploads a malicious HTML file through the file upload functionality of the Convos application.
- When another user views or interacts with the uploaded file, the attacker's malicious script is executed within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the Convos application.
- No specific user privileges beyond file upload are required.
