Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` variable when generating the "Reload" button URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application takes user-controlled input (part of the URL) and reflects it back to the user within the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted URL. This code would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they click the "Reload" button, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking
    - Redirect the user to a malicious website
    - Modify the content of the page
    - Perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted URL that is sent to a user.
- When the user navigates to the page with the malicious URL parameter, the vulnerable code will generate the "Reload" button, which includes the malicious script embedded in the link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking the "Reload" button.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code was located in `ajax/common.tabs.php`.
- The fix involved removing the vulnerable line that was generating the "Reload" link: `echo "<a href='".htmlentities($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])."' class='vsubmit'>Reload</a>";`.
- This was addressed in version 9.5.7 of GLPI.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a reflected XSS where a malicious URL can be used to inject Javascript code via the reload button of the GLPI interface.
