Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization within the `WP_Meta_Query` class in WordPress. Specifically, the code does not adequately sanitize input when generating SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious SQL code into the query. This means an attacker can manipulate the database queries being executed.
- Improper sanitization of input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The vulnerability can lead to blind SQL injection, where an attacker may not see the results of their queries directly but can infer information through the response behavior of the server.
- Potential data exfiltration, unauthorized data modification, or other database-related attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is processed by the `WP_Meta_Query` class. The specific way to trigger this vulnerability was not detailed in the provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to pass user-controlled input that interacts with the vulnerable `WP_Meta_Query` functions.
- Authenticated users with specific roles/capabilities that interact with meta queries could be a possible attack position, but the content doesn't specify the specific requirements.
- The attacker does not necessarily need direct access to the database server, but rather to manipulate SQL queries via the WordPress application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in WordPress versions 4.1 to 5.8.2.
- It was patched in WordPress version 5.8.3 and backported to older versions, down to 4.1.34.
- The fix involves improved sanitization within `WP_Meta_Query` to prevent the injection of malicious SQL code.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Moderate" severity.
