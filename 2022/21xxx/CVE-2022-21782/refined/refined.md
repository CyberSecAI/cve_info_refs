- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the WLAN driver leading to an out-of-bounds write due to a missing bounds check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write due to missing bounds check
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the vulnerability through the WLAN driver
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: System execution privileges are needed. No user interaction is needed.
