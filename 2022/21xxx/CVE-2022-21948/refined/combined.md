* **Checklist item** changed from [ ] paste.opensuse.org, [x] release-tools.opensuse.org (could be moved to cloud foundry), [x] yast.opensuse.org (could be moved to cloud foundry) to [ ] paste.opensuse.org
* **Subject** changed from *handle non-opensuse.org hosted instances*  to *Migrate paste.o.o to local infrastructure*

Availability of software for pastes is terrible, so we are working on adapting modern-paste in a fork <https://github.com/postmodern-paste/postmodern-paste>

That does allow us to keep pictures as attachments btw, so we could keep full functionality

If you know python and bootstrap, have a look at <https://github.com/postmodern-paste/postmodern-paste/issues>

### We don’t have enough data to show anything useful.

It usually takes about a week to populate this graph.

### There are too many commits to generate this graph.

More information about this data can be found in the
[activity documentation](https://docs.github.com/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/analyzing-changes-to-a-repositorys-content).

We need at least one non-empty commit with an email to generate this graph.

We tried our best, but the graph wouldn’t load. Try reloading the page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1197930#c0)  Victor Pereira   2022-04-01 12:34:13 UTC  ``` I would like to request a CVE for the paste <https://github.com/openSUSE/paste>  An attacker could upload a crafted SVG file and trigger a javascript execution. a PoC cann be found here: <https://paste.opensuse.org/images/25863829.svg>   The source code used in the PoC:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "<http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd>"> <svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="<http://www.w3.org/2000/svg>">    <polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>    <script type="text/javascript">       alert("xss");    </script> </svg> ```  Please note that, because of missing security flags in the tokens, the script is able to access the user access token. Therefore an attack could weaponize this script to gain access to other resources protected behind the same OpenID/IDP. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1197930#c2)  Victor Pereira   2022-04-01 15:42:34 UTC  ``` Actually the upstream of paste lives here: <https://github.com/openSUSE/paste>.   The Stikked was forked into paste. The issue was introduced by SUSE, probably in the commit <https://github.com/openSUSE/paste/commit/cfc881f91bf34c2b96878945dbca394c93361f2e>, so Stikked isn't affected by this issue, just the paste code offered by openSUSE official git. IMO, that's kind of the same relationship between ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick.  We can see in the git log, that SUSE employees still pushing changes to the git repository and we still have this service up and running in our infrastructure, connected to our IDP. so I guess we can find the "maintainers" and we should definitely assign a CVE for that, otherwise at least disable the service and drop the package from github?  We definitely have an internal instance, running by infra. Strange that now, <http://paste.suse.de/> leads me to our internal CA.   How should we proceed? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1197930#c3)  Victor Pereira   2022-04-01 16:00:15 UTC  ``` it used to have its own "roadmap" of features <https://michal.hrusecky.net/2010/08/opensuse-paste-update/> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1197930#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2022-04-04 09:35:13 UTC  ``` As it is a hosted app by us, CVE assignment guidance is mixed. and it might not get a CVE.  it seems unlikely it is used by others too.   It still needs to be fixed. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1197930#c5)  Victor Pereira   2022-04-04 10:38:33 UTC  ``` > As it is a hosted app by us, CVE assignment guidance is mixed. and it might not > get a CVE.  Why shouldn't it get a CVE? An attacker could paste a link to the XSS page in any openSUSE platform and retrieve the session token that could be use in any other tool behind the same openID. For example, Adding the captured session token I was able to login in the forums.opensuse.org. In my evaluation, it would be a critical vulnerability based on CVSS scoring system <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C>  I don't think we can measure where any of our open source projects hosted on github are being used, right? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1197930#c7)  Johannes Segitz   2022-04-05 06:51:31 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-21948 for this ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1197930#c8)  Gianluca Gabrielli   2022-04-05 11:11:15 UTC  ``` Hi Jonas, would you like to take over this finding and write a patch for that?

# [openSUSE Paste update](/2010/08/opensuse-paste-update/)

So some other things happened with openSUSE Paste so I want to inform you about the current situation. We have <http://susepaste.org> address, right? So from yesterday, we also have <http://paste.opensuse.org>. Same computer, same IP, just different name if you prefer the other one. As it is the same thing as [susepaste.org](http://susepaste.org), links are interchangeable. So you can post something to [susepaste.org](http://susepaste.org) and send link to [paste.opensuse.org](http://paste.opensuse.org) or vise versa. Just replace the first part of the url ð

Other interesting thing to report is that [Pascal Bleser](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com) added support for susepaste to [pastebinit](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=pastebinit&project=network%3Autilities), so if you donât like mine [simple script](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=susepaste&project=openSUSE%3AFactory%3AContrib), you can use more advanced tool ð But this is nothing new, he already [blogged](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/08/pastebinit-with-susepaste-support.html) about that. Next steps on openSUSE Paste includes localization, documentation for the script and getting it to the common menu on all openSUSE sites. But I need to get back to other things for a moment so it has to wait a little bit ð
