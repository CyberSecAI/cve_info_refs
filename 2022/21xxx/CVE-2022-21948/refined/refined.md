  "CVE-2022-21948": {
    "description": "The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the openSUSE paste service, specifically within the image upload functionality.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the paste service. The application allows users to upload SVG files, which can contain embedded JavaScript. When these SVG files are accessed, the embedded scripts execute in the user's browser context, leading to XSS.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
         "Lack of proper handling of SVG files",
        "Stored XSS vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could upload a crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript. When other users view this paste, the embedded script will execute in their browsers. This can lead to session hijacking through access to the user's access token, allowing attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to other resources protected by the same OpenID/IDP, like forums.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves uploading a malicious SVG file via the paste service's image upload functionality.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to upload content to the paste service, requiring no special privileges beyond being a regular user of the service."
    },
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was introduced in a commit that added SVG support to the paste service. The issue was initially reported internally and was later made public. The service has since been migrated to a different codebase and the vulnerable code is no longer in use.  The vulnerability was present in the openSUSE fork of the Stikked pastebin software."
