{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `*Bincount` operations in TensorFlow do not properly validate input arguments, leading to a `CHECK`-fail when the output tensors are allocated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Lack of proper shape inference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service. Malicious users can cause a program crash by providing specific input arguments to the `*Bincount` operations, which will trigger a `CHECK`-fail.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing crafted inputs to the `DenseBincount`, `SparseBincount` and `RaggedBincount` operations in TensorFlow.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to call the affected TensorFlow operations with arbitrary input values."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "TensorFlow versions prior to 2.8.0 are affected.",
    "patched_versions": "The issue was patched in versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1, and will be included in 2.8.0.",
    "example": "The example provided in the advisory shows how to trigger the vulnerability using `tf.raw_ops.DenseBincount` with specific arguments."
