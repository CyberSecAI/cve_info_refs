  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The JDBC driver did not verify if certain classes implemented the expected interface before instantiating the class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unchecked Class Instantiation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). Remote code execution is also possible when an attacker is able to control the JDBC URL or properties.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must control the jdbc URL or properties to instantiate arbitrary classes and execute code."

  "recommended_action": "Upgrade PostgreSQL JDBC Driver to versions 42.2.25 or 42.3.2 or later. NetApp products will be updated with software fixes. Red Hat has provided patches to their products. Debian has provided patches to their libpgjava package.",
  "additional_information": {
    "github_advisory": "pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided via `authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties. However, the driver did not verify if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating the class."
