Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21241:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization when processing CSV files within the CSV+ application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input from the CSV file, particularly within `<a>` tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79:** The application is susceptible to stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored in the CSV file. When a user opens the malicious CSV file, the injected script executes within the context of the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** If a CSV file containing a malicious `<a>` tag is loaded and clicked by a user, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the user's browser session, potentially leading to actions on behalf of the user, information disclosure, or further attacks.
- **OS Command Execution (potential):** The description notes the possibility of OS command execution, suggesting a severe impact if the script can interact with the local system via specific vectors such as browser exploits.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious CSV file:** An attacker crafts a CSV file containing malicious `<a href>` tags with embedded JavaScript.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious CSV file with the vulnerable application (CSV+) and click on a specially crafted link within the CSV file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify CSV files.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious CSV file using the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have any specific access to the user's system initially.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information from the github link confirms a fix was made in version 0.8.1 which includes "sanitizing process".
- The vulnerability is rated as a high severity issue by both CVSS v3 (7.8) and CVSS v2 (6.8).
