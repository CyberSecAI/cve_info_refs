**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper input sanitization in OnionShare's chat functionality. Specifically, the application fails to remove trailing whitespace characters (including invisible whitespace) from usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize usernames, allowing the inclusion of trailing whitespace characters. This can be considered a form of canonicalization issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Impersonation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to impersonate other chat participants by adding trailing spaces to their chosen username. This makes it difficult for other users to distinguish between the legitimate user and the imposter.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be a participant in the OnionShare chat session.
- The attacker utilizes the rename feature in the chat application.
- The attacker adds a trailing whitespace character (or multiple) to the desired username they want to impersonate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the chat environment as a participant.
- The attacker must be able to use the "rename" functionality within the chat.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test conducted by Radically Open Security.
-  The vulnerability is identified as OTF-005.
- The vulnerability has a low severity rating.
- The issue affects OnionShare versions >= 2.3 and is fixed in version 2.5.
- The fix involves removing non-visible characters from the username.
