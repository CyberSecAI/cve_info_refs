Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the custom CSS administration form of GLPI (a free IT and asset management software).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the custom CSS code) before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with entity administrator privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
    - Retrieval of normally inaccessible data from the GLPI database, including sensitive information such as user data, system data, and mysql data.
    - Potential modification or deletion of data within the database.
    - Possible compromise of the entire GLPI system, depending on the database user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the custom CSS administration form accessible to entity administrators.
- By crafting malicious SQL code within the custom CSS field, an attacker can inject the SQL query to be executed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have the privileges of an "Entity administrator" within the GLPI system.
- The attacker must be able to access the custom CSS administration form within the GLPI interface.

**Additional Details**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in GLPI version 9.5.7
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by "bull53y3fl1nch".
- A workaround for this vulnerability is to disable "Entities" update right.
- The fix involves escaping the user-provided `custom_css_code` using `$DB->escape()` before using it in database queries.
