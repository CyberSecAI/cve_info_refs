- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing bounds check in camera isp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure. An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation can be achieved through the camera isp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs system execution privileges. No user interaction is needed.
