Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21938:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content from CISA directly references CVE-2022-21938 in their advisory for Johnson Controls Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers. This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The root cause of CVE-2022-21938 is an **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**. Specifically, this vulnerability is present in the Draft Graphics (MUI Graphics) web interfaces of the affected products.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious code into the web interfaces of the affected products, specifically the Draft Graphics (MUI Graphics).

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

- **Malicious Code Injection:** An attacker can inject and store malicious code within the Draft Graphics (MUI Graphics) web interfaces.
- **Potential for Various Attacks:** This injected code could be used for various malicious purposes, such as:
    - Data theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacement of the web interface.
    - Potentially gaining further access to the system or network.

**5. Attack Vectors**

- **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely if they have access to the affected server's network.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is specifically located in the Draft Graphics (MUI Graphics) web interface of Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS servers.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

- **Network Access:** An attacker must have network access to the affected Metasys server.
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (e.g., administrative or privileged user rights) to interact with the Draft Graphics interface to inject malicious code.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to interact with the malicious code, which could be achieved through clicking a link or performing a specific action within the compromised web interface. This is indicated by the "UI:R" in the CVSS vector.

**Additional Information**

- **Affected Products:**  Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS versions 10 and 11
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.1, with the vector string: AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
-   **Mitigation:** Johnson Controls recommends updating Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Version 10 with patch 10.1.5 and Version 11 with patch 11.0.2.
-   **CISA Recommendations:** CISA provides general recommendations to minimize the risk, including minimizing network exposure, placing control systems behind firewalls, and using secure VPNs for remote access when needed.
