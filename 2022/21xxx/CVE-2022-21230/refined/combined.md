### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `org.nanohttpd:nanohttpd`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure. Whenever an HTTP Session is parsing the body of an HTTP request, the body of the request is written to a `RandomAccessFile` when the it is larger than 1024 bytes. This file is created with insecure permissions that allow its contents to be viewed by all users on the host machine.

**Workaround:** Manually specifying the `-Djava.io.tmpdir=` argument when launching Java to set the temporary directory to a directory exclusively controlled by the current user can fix this issue.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

# Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions in org.nanohttpd:nanohttpd

Moderate

[JLLeitschuh](/JLLeitschuh)
published
GHSA-2r85-x9cf-8fcg
Apr 6, 2022

## Package

maven

org.nanohttpd:nanohttpd
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<=2.3.1

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Patches

No patches are available. The maintainers have been unresponsive. It may be appropriate to consider this project unmaintained at this point.

### Impact

The `org.nanohttpd.protocols.http.tempfiles.DefaultTempFileManager` & `org.nanohttpd.protocols.http.tempfiles.DefaultTempFile` contain a local temporary file information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. As such, files written to that directory without setting the correct file permissions can allow other users on that system to view the contents of the files written to those temporary files.

#### Vulnerability Locations

* <https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd/blob/efb2ebf85a2b06f7c508aba9eaad5377e3a01e81/core/src/main/java/org/nanohttpd/protocols/http/tempfiles/DefaultTempFile.java#L58>
* <https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd/blob/efb2ebf85a2b06f7c508aba9eaad5377e3a01e81/core/src/main/java/org/nanohttpd/protocols/http/tempfiles/DefaultTempFileManager.java#L60>

Whenever an HTTP Session is parsing the body of an HTTP request, the body of the request is written to a RandomAccessFile when the body is larger than 1024 bytes. Unfortunately, RandomAccessFile is created using a temporary file which is created with file permissions that allow it's contents to be viewed by all users on the host machine.

### Workarounds

Manually specifying the `-Djava.io.tmpdir=` argument when launching Java to set set the temporary directory to a directory exclusively controlled by the current user can fix this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
