Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21937:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from CISA explicitly mentions CVE-2022-21937 in its advisory for Johnson Controls Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2022-21937 is **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**. This means the software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in a web page, which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79:** The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for the injection and storage of malicious code within the web interfaces of the affected products.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

*   **Malicious code injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the web interfaces.
*   **Compromised Web Interface:** injected code will execute in the browsers of the users of the web interface, potentially leading to theft of credentials, session hijacking, or further attacks against the server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network, given the vulnerability is present in the web interfaces of the product, making it accessible if the server is reachable.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction by requiring a user to visit a malicious page containing the injected code.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Metasys server.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to inject and store malicious code in the web interfaces.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker must get a user to visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The CISA advisory provides a CVSS v3 base score of 8.7 for this vulnerability with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). This indicates a high-severity vulnerability that is remotely exploitable, has a low attack complexity, requires low privileges, and user interaction, and can have a high impact on confidentiality and integrity.
*   The advisory mentions that Johnson Controls has released patches to address this vulnerability, and users are advised to update their Metasys systems.
*   CISA recommends minimizing network exposure for control systems and using secure methods for remote access.
