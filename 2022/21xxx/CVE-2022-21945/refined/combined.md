| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-02-24 14:04:22 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1196140](show_bug.cgi?id=1196140 "RESOLVED FIXED - AUDIT-TRACKER: cscreen: review of /etc/sudoers.d/cscreen")  The cscreen package uses a fixed path /tmp/cscreen.debug in the script /usr/bin/cscreen_update_config.sh:  ``` function add_window() {     <...snip...>     echo $_host >> /tmp/cscreen.debug     echo $_status >> /tmp/cscreen.debug     if [ -n "$_status" ];then         echo "screen -x $session -X $_status" >> /tmp/cscreen.debug         screen -x $session -X defhstatus "$_status" >>/tmp/cscreen.debug 2>&1     fi     echo "Add Window $TITLE: screen -x $session -X $COMMAND" >>/tmp/cscreen.debug     <...snip...> } ```  Luckily no one seems to be reading from there anymore.  Without symlink protection this could be a local DoS vector against the system. By placing a FIFO in this location it could be a dedicated DoS and information leak against the update script.  Please change the script either to drop this debug file by default, by using an unpredictable temporary file name, or by using a safe location for the file that is not accessible by every user in the system. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c1)  Olaf Hering   2022-02-25 12:19:51 UTC  ``` This script is called by orthos. When do we intend to lift the embargo? I changed the location to /run/cscreen/ ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-02-25 14:47:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to Olaf Hering from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c1)) > This script is called by orthos. > When do we intend to lift the embargo? I changed the location to > /run/cscreen/  It's up to us. I suggest when you have solutions ready for both issues then we can publish it. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c3)  Olaf Hering   2022-02-25 16:01:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 856583](attachment.cgi?id=856583 "bug1196446.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=856583&action=edit "bug1196446.patch") [bug1196446](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2022-21945: cscreen: usage of fixed path /tmp/cscreen.debug").patch  I think this change will fix the issue. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-02-28 12:39:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to ohering@suse.com from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c3)) > Created [attachment 856583](attachment.cgi?id=856583 "bug1196446.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=856583&action=edit "bug1196446.patch") > [bug1196446](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2022-21945: cscreen: usage of fixed path /tmp/cscreen.debug").patch >  > I think this change will fix the issue.  Yes, using the dedicated /run/ directory is good. I'm not quite sure about the kind of debug output generated by these commands, could it be prudent to protect the debug file from world and only allow e.g. members of the same _cscreen group to read them? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c5)  Olaf Hering   2022-02-28 12:49:24 UTC  ``` yeah, I already planned to adjust the mask in tmpfile.conf. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c7)  Johannes Segitz   2022-03-09 10:16:22 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-21945 for this. For the other issue I'm still a bit torn and need to think about it more ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1196446#c8)  Olaf Hering   2022-03-09 10:26:47 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream. <https://github.com/openSUSE/cscreen/commit/e9a698cc317125300ff49d99b841f537a61fe65f> ``` |  |
