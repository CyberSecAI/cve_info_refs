- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect bounds check in the WLAN driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The weakness is an improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to local information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some form of access to the device. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs System execution privileges. User interaction is not required for exploitation.
