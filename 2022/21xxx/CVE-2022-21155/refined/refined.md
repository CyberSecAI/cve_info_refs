- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially crafted packet sent to the Fernhill SCADA Server may cause an exception, leading the server process (FHSvrService.exe) to exit.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400). The server does not properly handle specific packets, leading to an exception and process termination.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the SCADA server unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. A remote attacker can send a malicious packet to the Fernhill SCADA Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated (no prior access or credentials required) and needs to have network access to the SCADA server. The attack complexity is low.
