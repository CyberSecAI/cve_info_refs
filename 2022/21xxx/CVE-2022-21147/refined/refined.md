Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `coen.aym` module of ESTsoft Alyac during PE file scanning. Specifically, the code iterates through section headers in a PE file to find the `.text` section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The code does not validate if the provided PE file is large enough to contain the number of section headers specified in its header. It uses the `NumberOfSections` field from the PE header for loop control, but it does not verify that the file is big enough to accommodate all the section headers, leading to out-of-bounds reads if the section count is high and the file size is small.
- **Lack of Size Validation:** The core issue is the absence of a check to ensure the validity of the section table based on the declared number of sections and file size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a crash of the Alyac scanning process due to an access violation when reading out of bounds. This effectively disables the antivirus scan function.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PE File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted PE (Portable Executable) file to Alyac. This file would have a valid PE header but a number of declared sections that, when iterated through, goes beyond the actual size of the PE file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Submit a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious PE file to be scanned by ESTsoft Alyac. This can happen via the local file system scan or real-time scanning of newly downloaded files, for instance.
- **No Specific Privilege:** The exploit is triggered by the scanning process itself and doesn't require any specific user privilege beyond what is needed to execute the anti-virus.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is in the `coen.aym` module, specifically in the `sub_180086C30` function.
- The code iterates through section headers using a loop counter (`RBX`).
- The `NumberOfSections` field from the PE header is used for loop control.
- The offset of each section header is added to `RCX` register for lookup of the section name, using `_strnicmp` function to compare against ".text"
- There is no check to confirm the file size prior to accessing the section headers.
- The crash occurs during the `_strnicmp` call due to an out-of-bounds read, which leads to an access violation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor was notified and patched the vulnerability in version 2.5.7.7
- The CVSS score is 5.0 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H), indicating a local attack vector, low complexity, low privileges needed, user interaction required, no impact to confidentiality or integrity, and high impact to availability.
