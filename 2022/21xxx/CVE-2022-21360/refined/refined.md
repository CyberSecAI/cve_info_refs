Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-21360:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the `ImageIO` component of the OpenJDK Java runtime. This indicates a potential flaw in how Java handles image input and output operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The specific vulnerability is not described in detail, but the presence of the issue in `ImageIO` suggests a flaw related to parsing, processing, or handling image data.
*   The documents mention that the vulnerability might allow for a bypass of deserialization restrictions. This implies a potential issue with how the system handles data that is supposed to be restricted or serialized.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS), where the application or system becomes unavailable due to a crash or hang.
*   The vulnerability can allow for the bypass of deserialization restrictions, which can allow an attacker to execute code, gain access to sensitive data or cause a denial of service.
*   The vulnerability could lead to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is primarily network-based, as indicated by the "AV:N" (Network) in the CVSS vector strings. 
*   The NetApp advisory states the vulnerability could allow a compromise of Java SE via network access.
*   The Oracle advisory states the vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
*   The attacker does not need any prior privileges to exploit the vulnerability, as indicated by "PR:N" (No privileges required) in CVSS.
*   No user interaction is required for exploitation, as indicated by "UI:N" (No user interaction required) in CVSS.
*   The attack is on the application itself.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of OpenJDK, including versions 8, 11 and 17.
*   Multiple vendors like Debian, Gentoo, and NetApp have issued advisories for this CVE, indicating it affects many systems that utilize OpenJDK.
*   The vulnerability is considered of medium severity, with a CVSS score of 5.3.
*   The vulnerability is also listed in the January 2022 Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory.
*   The vulnerability is listed in the NetApp advisory NTAP-20220121-0007.
*   The vulnerability was credited to Fabian Meumertzheim of Code Intelligence.
*   NetApp's advisory states that successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the compromise of Java SE via network access, lead to unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (DoS) of Java SE, or allow unauthorized read, update, insert or delete access to some Java SE accessible data.
*   Patches have been released to address this vulnerability in OpenJDK, NetApp products and other vendor's products.

The information provided across the documents is consistent with a vulnerability that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service or information disclosure on systems running vulnerable versions of OpenJDK. The vulnerability resides in the ImageIO component, and the lack of specific details suggests a parsing or handling error with image data that can cause the application to crash or disclose sensitive data.
