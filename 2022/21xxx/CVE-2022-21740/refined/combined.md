# Heap overflow in `SparseCountSparseOutput`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-44qp-9wwf-734r
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

The [implementation of `SparseCountSparseOutput`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L168-L273) is vulnerable to a heap overflow:

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(
  indices=[[-1,-1]],
  values=[2],
  dense_shape=[1, 1],
  weights=[1],
  binary_output=True,
  minlength=-1,
  maxlength=-1,
  name=None)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commits [2b7100d6cdff36aa21010a82269bc05a6d1cc74a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2b7100d6cdff36aa21010a82269bc05a6d1cc74a) and [adbbabdb0d3abb3cdeac69e38a96de1d678b24b3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/adbbabdb0d3abb3cdeac69e38a96de1d678b24b3).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Faysal Hossain Shezan from University of Virginia.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-21740

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Cleanup and remove duplicate validation in `SparseCount`.

```
We have valdiation that is duplicated, checking different conditions, in different formats and failing to capture all cases. This should fix all the previous bugs.
