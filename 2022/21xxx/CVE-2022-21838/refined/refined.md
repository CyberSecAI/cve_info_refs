- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `SilentCleanup` scheduled task. An attacker can exploit this by creating a symbolic link to manipulate the task into deleting a folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation. It involves the abuse of the `SilentCleanup` scheduled task through symbolic link manipulation, leading to arbitrary file system deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. The vulnerability is exploited by creating a symbolic link that misdirects the `SilentCleanup` task.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target Windows system. They also need to be able to create symbolic links.
