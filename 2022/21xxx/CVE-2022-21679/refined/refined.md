Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of the new Envoy API introduced in Istio 1.12 with the old (1.11) data plane. Specifically, Istio 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 control planes generate configurations for proxies which use the new Envoy API, but this configuration is then used by older proxies of version 1.11. This causes the `hosts` and `notHosts` fields to be evaluated incorrectly, regardless of the actual value of the host header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect API usage:** The core issue is the mismatch between the control plane (1.12.0/1.12.1) using a new Envoy API and the data plane (1.11) using an old one.
- **Authorization Policy Bypass:**  The `hosts` and `notHosts` fields within the authorization policies are not correctly evaluated. This leads to bypasses for ALLOW actions and unexpected rejections for DENY actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass Authorization:** The main impact is a potential bypass of intended authorization policies. This could allow unauthorized access to services or resources.
- **Unexpected Rejections:** Conversely, legitimate requests might be denied when using DENY action due to the policy being matched incorrectly, causing disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network based, as requests can be crafted with specific host headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected service.
- **Understanding of Authorization Policies:** It is necessary that the attacker understands the existing authorization policies to exploit it properly and bypass them.
- **Mixing Control/Data Plane Versions**: The vulnerability is exposed only when mixing a 1.12.0/1.12.1 control plane with a 1.11 data plane, during an upgrade.
