# Authorization Policy For Host Rules During Upgrades

Moderate

[howardjohn](/howardjohn)
published
GHSA-rwfr-xrvw-2rvv
Jan 19, 2022

## Package

gomod

istio.io/istio
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

1.12.0-1.12.1

## Patched versions

1.12.2

## Description

**Impact**

The authorization policy with `hosts` and `notHosts` might be accidentally bypassed for ALLOW action or rejected unexpectedly for DENY action during the upgrade from 1.11 to 1.12.0/1.12.1.

Istio 1.12 supports the `hosts` and `notHosts` fields in authorization policy with a new Envoy API shipped with the 1.12 data plane. A bug in the 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 incorrectly uses the new Envoy API with the 1.11 data plane. This will cause the `hosts` and `notHosts` fields to be always matched regardless of the actual value of the host header when mixing 1.12.0/1.12.1 control plane and 1.11 data plane.

**Workarounds**

* Upgrade to the latest 1.12.2 or;
* Do not mix the 1.12.0/1.12.1 control plane with 1.11 data plane if using `hosts` or `notHosts` field in authorization policy.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Security Update

* **[CVE-2022-21679](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2CVE-2022-21679i])**:
  Istio versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 contain a vulnerability where configuration for proxies at version 1.11 is generated incorrectly, affecting the `hosts` and `notHosts` field in the authorization policy.
* **[CVE-2022-21701](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2CVE-2022-21679i])**:
  Istio versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 are vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`.
