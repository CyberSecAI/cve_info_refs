Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the `key` tensor in the `MapStage` and `OrderedMapStage` operations within TensorFlow.  Specifically, the code didn't enforce the requirement that the `key` tensor must be a scalar (single element) int64 value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Input Validation:** The `MapStage` and `OrderedMapStage` ops were not validating that the input `key` tensor was a scalar int64 as required by documentation. This allowed non-scalar tensors to be passed, leading to a `CHECK`-failure.
- **Missing Type/Shape Enforcement:** The code did not explicitly check if the key was an int64 scalar.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Providing a non-scalar `key` tensor to the `MapStage` or `OrderedMapStage` ops would cause a `CHECK`-fail, crashing the program. This could be leveraged for a denial-of-service attack, making the TensorFlow model unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft a TensorFlow model that calls `MapStage` or `OrderedMapStage` with a non-scalar `key` tensor.
- **Model Manipulation:** An attacker with access to model definition could modify it to include the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide inputs to a TensorFlow model or modify its definition to include a non-scalar key tensor passed to the vulnerable ops.
- No special system level privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `tensorflow/core/kernels/map_stage_op.cc`.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in commit `f57315566d7094f322b784947093406c2aea0d7d`.
- The fix includes adding the check `OP_REQUIRES(ctx, key_tensor->NumElements() == 1, ...)` to ensure that the key is a scalar.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.8.0 and is patched in versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3 and 2.7.1.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
