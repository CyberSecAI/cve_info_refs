*   The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) meaning that a user needs to perform some action, such as opening a malicious file.
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable Fuji Electric Alpha5 servo drive system.
*  The attacker needs to induce a user to perform a certain action.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected product is the Fuji Electric Alpha5 servo drive system, all versions prior to 4.3
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   There are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability
*   The provided CVSS v3 base score is 3.3 with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
*   The vendor, Fuji Electric, recommends upgrading to Alpha5 v4.4 to remediate the vulnerability.
