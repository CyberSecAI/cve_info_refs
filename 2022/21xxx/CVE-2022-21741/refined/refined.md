Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21741:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing check for positive values of dilation height and width factors in the `depthwise_conv.cc` file within the TensorFlow Lite library.
- Specifically, the code calculates padding sizes using these dilation factors in a division operation without ensuring these factors are strictly positive, leading to a potential division-by-zero error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Division by zero:** The primary vulnerability is the possibility of a division-by-zero error in the padding calculation within the depthwise convolution operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Floating Point Exception (FPE):** An attacker can craft a malicious TFLite model with dilation factors set to zero which would trigger a division-by-zero error, resulting in a floating-point exception (FPE). This would likely cause the application processing the TFLite model to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted TFLite Model:** The attack vector involves creating a specially crafted TFLite model where the parameters for depthwise convolution are set to values that would result in a division by zero when the padding is computed.
- The attacker can control the dilation height and width factors, parameters used in the division.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TFLite model to the targeted application. This could be achieved in scenarios where the application loads user-provided TFLite models, or potentially via supply chain attacks where a malicious model gets distributed through a compromised update.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/lite/kernels/depthwise_conv.cc` file, specifically in the Prepare function where the padding calculation occurs.
- The fix involves adding validation checks to ensure the dilation height and width factors are strictly greater than zero.
- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3, and 2.7.1, and will be included in the 2.8.0 release.
- The vulnerability was reported by Wang Xuan of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.
