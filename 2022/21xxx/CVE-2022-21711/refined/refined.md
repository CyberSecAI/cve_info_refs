Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21711:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the parsing component of the `elfspirit` tool when analyzing ELF files. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when accessing the section header string table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code reads data from an address that is outside the allocated buffer for the ELF file, due to an unchecked offset from the section header string table. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow/out-of-bounds read.
- **Lack of proper bounds checking:** The code fails to validate the offset of the section name within the ELF file boundaries, which allows for reading data beyond the file's allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** By crafting a malicious ELF file with a specific offset, an attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from memory by reading data at arbitrary addresses.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can lead to a segmentation fault (SEGV) and crash the `elfspirit` application, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious ELF File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted ELF file containing manipulated section header table information. This file needs to be provided to the `elfspirit` tool for parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply the malicious file to `elfspirit`:** The attacker needs to have the ability to provide the crafted ELF file to the vulnerable tool. This could be through user interaction or other means.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `parse.c` file of the `elfspirit` project.
- The issue is triggered during the processing of the section header string table when the section name offset is not validated.
- The fix involves adding a `validated_offset` function to check that the memory address is legal and is within the allocated memory range of the ELF file. The code uses the `validated_offset` function to validate the `name` offset.
