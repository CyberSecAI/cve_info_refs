{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `QuantizedMaxPool` implementation did not properly handle cases where the `min_input` or `max_input` tensors were empty, leading to a reference binding to a null pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of empty input tensors",
      "Potential null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability results in an undefined behavior, which may lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior due to a null pointer dereference.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing empty lists for the `min_input` or `max_input` parameters to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMaxPool` operation.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to construct and execute a TensorFlow graph using the affected operation. No special privileges are required."
