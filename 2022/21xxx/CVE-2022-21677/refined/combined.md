# Group advanced search option may leak group and group's members visibility

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-768r-ppv4-5r27
Jan 14, 2022

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.7.12; beta <= 2.8.0.beta10; tests-passed <= 2.8.0.beta10

## Patched versions

stable > 2.7.12; beta > 2.8.0.beta10; tests-passed > 2.8.0.beta10

## Description

### Impact

Groups can be configured with varying visibility levels for the group as well as the group members. By default, a newly created group has its visibility set to public and the group's members visibility set to public as well. However, a group's visibility and the group's members visibility can be configured such that it is restricted to logged on users, members of the group or staff users. A vulnerability has been discovered where the group advanced search option does not respect the group's visibility and members visibility level. As such, a group with restricted visibility or members visibility can be revealed through search with the right search option.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.

### Workarounds

None.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-21677
