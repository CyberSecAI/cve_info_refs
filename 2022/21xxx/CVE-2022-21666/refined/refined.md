Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `useredit.php` file. Specifically, the code uses unsanitized user input within SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the direct inclusion of user-provided data (`$_GET["Name"]`, `$_GET["Mail"]`, `$_GET["Id"]`, `$_POST["N"]`) within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to bypass security restrictions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive database information like user credentials and other data.
- Although the advisory mentions that the vulnerability is in `usersearch.php`, the code snippets and the advisory itself mention `useredit.php` as the affected file. The commit diff also shows modifications to `usersearch.php`. It seems that SQL Injection is present on both files with the advisory naming the vulnerable file wrongly, this needs to be verified.
- The provided content notes that access to the vulnerable file is limited to admin users, which mitigates the impact to some degree. However, it still allows a malicious admin to manipulate data within the system's database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET and POST parameters passed to `usersearch.php` and `useredit.php`.
- Specifically,  `Name`, `Mail`, and `Id` parameters in GET requests to `usersearch.php`, and `N` parameter in the POST request to `useredit.php` are vulnerable to manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have admin-level access to the web application to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version `Pb2.4Bfx3`.
- The provided content indicates that the affected versions are `<Pb1.0Bfx0`, implying versions before 1.0Bfx0 are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was discovered by P0cas.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to update the `admin/pages/useredit.php` file, and most likely the `admin/pages/usersearch.php` file too.

This information provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-21666, including its root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors, and required attacker capabilities.
