Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-21662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It stems from how WordPress handles post slugs (the URL-friendly version of a post title).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** User-supplied data is not properly sanitized when creating post slugs, allowing a malicious script to be injected and stored in the database.
- The injected script is executed when the crafted slug is viewed by other users, which can include high-privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
- **Cross-site scripting:** This can lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or modifying content on the website.
- **Privilege escalation:** Low-privileged authenticated users (like authors) can potentially affect higher-privileged users such as administrators by leveraging the stored XSS vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A low-privileged authenticated attacker can create or edit a post with a specially crafted slug that contains malicious JavaScript code.
- When another user (including high-privileged users) views the post or a page that displays the slug, the malicious JavaScript will be executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create/edit posts (e.g., an author role) in WordPress.
- No other special permissions are required
