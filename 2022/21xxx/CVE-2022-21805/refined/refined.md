- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The php_mailform application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling attached file names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) exists due to unsanitized user input in the attached file name.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user who interacts with the vulnerable application. This could lead to actions performed on behalf of the victim or theft of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a user accessing a website using the vulnerable php_mailform and interacting with a malicious attached file name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to influence or inject a malicious file name. The user needs to visit the website and trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the malicious file name.
