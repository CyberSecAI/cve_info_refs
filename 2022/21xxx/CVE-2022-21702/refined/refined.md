  "CVE-2022-21702": {
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Grafana. Grafana versions prior to 7.5.15 and 8.3.5 are susceptible to vulnerabilities which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data.",
    "root_cause": "An attacker could serve HTML content through the Grafana datasource or plugin proxy and trick a user to visit this HTML page using a specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XSS vulnerability in data source handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data. An attacker could compromise an existing datasource for a specific Grafana instance or either set up its own public service and instruct anyone to set it up in their Grafana instance. Should an existing data source connected to Grafana be compromised, it could be used to inappropriately gain access to other data sources connected to the same Grafana org.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted link pointing at http://host/api/datasources/proxy/\"data source id\"",
      "A specially crafted link pointing at http://host/api/plugin-proxy/\"plugin id\"",
      "A specially crafted link pointing at /api/plugins/\"plugin id\"/resources* or /api/datasources/\"id\"/resources*"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the HTTP server serving the URL of the data source, plugin or backend service. An attacker somehow tricks a user of the Grafana instance to click/visit the link. A user thatâ€™s already authenticated to the Grafana instance must click on/visit the specially crafted link sent/provided by the attacker."
