- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `deep` function in the `deep-get-set` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2020-7715). It allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototypes of JavaScript objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability arises from the way the `deep` function handles path manipulation, specifically when the path includes `__proto__`. By controlling the 'path' value, an attacker can set this value to `__proto__.myValue` and subsequently assign a value to the prototype of the class of the object.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS): Overwriting or modifying properties of the base object prototype, such as `toString` or `valueOf`, can cause JavaScript exceptions and lead to a denial of service.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): If the application evaluates properties of an object and executes that evaluation (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can inject malicious code through prototype pollution.
    - Property Injection: Attackers can inject properties that the codebase relies on, such as security properties (e.g., cookies or tokens), to gain unauthorized access or privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through manipulating the path argument of the `deep` function, specifically by including `__proto__` in the path, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of objects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control the input of the `path` parameter that is passed to the vulnerable `deep` function.
