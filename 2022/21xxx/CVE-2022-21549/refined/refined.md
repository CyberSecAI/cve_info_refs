  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an issue in the `java.util.random` class, which does not correctly sample exponential or Gaussian distributions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper calculation of random distributions"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to incorrect or predictable random numbers, which might have security implications in applications relying on the random number generator for cryptographic purposes, simulation, or other uses.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network (where an application using the flawed random number generator is accessible)"
