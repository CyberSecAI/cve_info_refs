Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-21816:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA vGPU software, specifically in the Virtual GPU Manager (`nvidia.ko`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper handling within the Virtual GPU Manager allows a user in the guest OS to trigger a GPU interrupt storm on the hypervisor host.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) on the hypervisor host due to the interrupt storm.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local, as it requires a user within the guest operating system to initiate the malicious activity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have a user account within the guest operating system to trigger the vulnerability. No user interaction is required.

**Affected software:**
The vulnerability affects NVIDIA vGPU software running on various hypervisors, including Citrix Hypervisor, VMware vSphere, Red Hat Enterprise Linux with KVM, Ubuntu, and Nutanix AHV. Specifically, the Virtual GPU Manager component of the vGPU software is impacted. The following versions and prior are affected:
- 13.1
- 11.6
- 8.9
