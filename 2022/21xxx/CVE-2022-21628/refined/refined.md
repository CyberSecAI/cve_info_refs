Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-21628:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**
  - The vulnerability stems from an unspecified flaw within the `HttpServer` service in OpenJDK. Specifically, the `HttpServer` can be optionally configured with a maximum connection limit by setting the `jdk.httpserver.maxConnections` system property. When a positive integer value is set, a check is performed against established connections, and new connection may be immediately closed if the limit is reached. The details of the bug are not in the documents.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  -  The vulnerability is described as a "Better HttpServer service". While not explicit, this implies an issue with how the `HttpServer` handles connections, particularly in the context of a maximum connection limit.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
   -  The primary impact is a potential denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
   - When the connection limit is reached, instead of properly handling new connections (queue, etc) the new connections are closed.
  - A malicious actor might be able to cause a denial of service by opening more connections than the limit.

**4. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is network-based. 
   - An attacker would need to make multiple connection attempts to the vulnerable `HttpServer` to trigger the vulnerability.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - An attacker would need to be able to connect to the affected `HttpServer` over the network.
   - The attacker does not necessarily need any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information comes from multiple sources, including Fedora update notifications, Gentoo security advisories, and Oracle's Critical Patch Update advisory. These sources confirm that the vulnerability is present in various OpenJDK versions (8, 11, and 17).
* The provided content from oracle.com also shows that this CVE affects multiple Oracle products, beyond just the base Java SE installation.
* The Gentoo advisory lists this CVE along with other OpenJDK vulnerabilities, and confirms it is exploitable remotely.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by applying patches that include a fix for the identified issue within the `HttpServer` service, usually by updating OpenJDK to a version that includes the fix.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "Better HttpServer service" which seems to indicate an issue with connection handling.
* Several NetApp products also use the vulnerable component, and are subject to the same type of attack.
