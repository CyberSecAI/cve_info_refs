Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21700:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `DefaultArgumentConversionContext` in a static context within Micronaut. Specifically, when an invalid `Content-Type` header is sent, it leads to a memory leak because the `DefaultArgumentConversionContext` is used in static state. This is further specified as the commit introducing the vulnerability being [b8ec32c](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/commit/b8ec32c311689667c69ae7d9f9c3b3a8abc96fe3).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Repeatedly sending requests with invalid content-type headers causes a memory leak due to the improper static use of `DefaultArgumentConversionContext`.
- Inefficient resource management: The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The memory leak caused by the vulnerability can eventually exhaust the server's resources, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending HTTP requests with invalid `Content-Type` headers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific prior knowledge of the system is needed other than the endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a workaround:  replacing the default content type binder to properly handle invalid content types.
- The vulnerability is patched in Micronaut version 3.2.7 and above.
- The provided content includes specific commits where the vulnerability was introduced as well as a patch.
