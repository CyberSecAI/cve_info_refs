{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The shape inference implementation for `ReverseSequence` does not properly validate the `batch_dim` value, specifically negative values. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing dimension information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap out-of-bounds read",
    "Insufficient input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger a heap out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a TensorFlow program that uses `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` with a negative `batch_dim` value, specifically a value that is too negative, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability during shape inference.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters of the `ReverseSequence` operation, specifically the `batch_dim` argument. This could be achieved through various means such as a crafted model, or by manipulating data fed into a TensorFlow application."
