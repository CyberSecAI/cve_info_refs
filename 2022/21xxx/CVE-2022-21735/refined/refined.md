Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `FractionalMaxPool` operation in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a division-by-zero error. This occurs when the pooling ratio is greater than the input size for a specific dimension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Division by Zero:** The core issue is a missing check that could lead to a division by zero within the `FractionalMaxPool` implementation, specifically when generating the pooling sequence. The code uses the pooling ratio to determine the output size. If the pooling ratio is larger than the input dimension, this could cause a division by zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash of the TensorFlow process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input tensor and pooling ratio to the `FractionalMaxPool` operation in TensorFlow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to call the `FractionalMaxPool` operation with specific input values, specifically crafting the `pooling_ratio` attribute to be larger than the input dimension.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the file `tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc`.
*   The fix for the vulnerability involves adding a check to ensure that the pooling ratio is not higher than the input dimension size before calculating output size.
*   The fix is included in TensorFlow versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1 and will be in 2.8.0.
* The provided code snippet in the description shows how to trigger the vulnerability.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPool(
  value=tf.constant(value=[[[[1, 4, 2, 3]]]], dtype=tf.int64),
  pooling_ratio=[1.0, 1.44, 1.73, 1.0],
  pseudo_random=False,
  overlapping=False,
  deterministic=False,
  seed=0,
  seed2=0,
  name=None)
```

The fix commit `ba4e8ac4dc2991e350d5cc407f8598c8d4ee70fb` adds a check to ensure that `input_size[i]` is greater than or equal to `pooling_ratio_[i]` for each dimension.

```c++
OP_REQUIRES(
 context, input_size[i] >= pooling_ratio_[i],
 errors::InvalidArgument("Pooling ratio is higher than input "
 "dimension size for dimension ",
 i, ". Input dim size: ", input_size[i],
 " pooling ratio: ", pooling_ratio_[i]));
```
