Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-21194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded default credentials for operating system accounts created during the installation of Yokogawa's CENTUM and Exaopc products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The primary vulnerability is the presence of default, hard-coded passwords for OS accounts.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The system is vulnerable if the default password isn't changed after installation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the computer where the affected product is installed.
- Potential access to files and shared memory within the system.
- Possible system compromise (as suggested by the high impact scores).

**Attack vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network (AV:A):** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target system.
- **High Attack Complexity (AC:H):** Exploitation requires some level of sophistication, likely requiring knowledge of the default credentials and how to access the system.
- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** An attacker doesn't need prior access to the system.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** The attack can be executed without requiring the user to perform any actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target system.
- The attacker must know the default, hard-coded password for the OS account.
- Ability to access the target system via the compromised OS account.

**Additional details from the advisory:**

- The advisory clarifies that the vulnerability is mitigated if the default password for the OS account is changed after installation.
- The advisory identifies specific versions of CENTUM and Exaopc products that are vulnerable, including details on if the vulnerability applies with the CAMS function.
- The advisory strongly recommends users to update the software to remediate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found and reported by Jacob Baines from Dragos, Inc.
