Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-21177:

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** This is one of several vulnerabilities (Vulnerability 4) found in Yokogawa's CAMS for HIS log server.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is triggered when the CAMS for HIS log server receives a malformed packet. This malformed packet exploits an improper output neutralization for logs (CWE-117) and relative path traversal (CWE-23).
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Improper Output Neutralization for Logs (CWE-117):** The log server doesn't properly sanitize input before writing to log files, allowing for malicious content to be injected.
    *   **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The server allows the use of relative path characters in the malformed packet to write log files to arbitrary locations in the server.
    *   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The server can be crashed or made unavailable by providing a malformed packet, which may result in resource exhaustion.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** The CAMS for HIS log server can be crashed.
    *   **Arbitrary File Write:** Arbitrary log files can be created or overwritten at any location within the server's file system, including overwriting valid log files.
   *    **Log Manipulation:** Invalid logs can be created, which can make it difficult to analyze real log data when problems occur.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a malformed network packet to the CAMS for HIS log server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected system (Adjacent Network).
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network packets to the affected server.
    *   User interaction (UI:R) is required as stated in CVSS score.
**CVSS Score:** 5.9
**CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H

**Affected Products:**
*  CENTUM CS 3000 (R3.08.10 - R3.09.00 if LHS4800(CAMS for HIS) is installed)
*  CENTUM VP (R4.01.00 - R4.03.00 if CAMS function is used, R5.01.00 - R5.04.20, R6.01.00 - R6.08.00)
* Exaopc (R3.72.00 - R3.79.00 if NTPF100-S6 "For CENTUM VP Support CAMS for HIS" is installed)

**Countermeasures:**
*  Upgrade to specified versions that address the vulnerability (e.g. R6.09.00 for CENTUM VP and R3.80.00 for Exaopc)
* For end-of-support products (CS 3000), upgrade to the latest revision of CENTUM VP.
