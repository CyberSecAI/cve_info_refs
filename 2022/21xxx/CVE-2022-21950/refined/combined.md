##### Overview

### Request 993737 revoked

canna is out of upstream maintenance for more than 15 years.

openSUSE keeps the latest edition was released in 2004, and there's no user using it now.

At the same time, it will continue to cost M17N team time to maintain and fix errors(eg: build time), because modern Linux will involve more new libraries, which break canna's build env.

In addition, canna also causes many security issues because of the code is too old, and the new security risk has been exposed more and more, These problems could not have been fully predicted or considered 15 years ago, All of these problems required our M17N team to solve with limited manpower.

So I request to delete it, please consider my suggestion. thank you!

Sec team also requested deletion:

<https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/992710>

Problem is:

```
canna-libs provides libcanna.so.1()(64bit) required by mlterm-canna
Error: missing alternative provides for libcanna.so.1()(64bit)
canna is still a build requirement of:

- canna-yubin
- cannadic
- kinput2
- mlterm
- scim-canna
- uim
- xemacs
- xemacs-packages

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1199280#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-05-06 12:49:22 UTC  ``` The canna systemd service uses a publically accessible directory /tmp/.iroha_unix for placing a UNIX domain socket in it. The socket is accessible for all other users in the system.  canna ships a systemd-tmpfiles configuration file to create this directory at boot time:  /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/canna-tmpfiles.conf:  ``` d /tmp/.iroha_unix 0755 root root - ```  This is necessary, because otherwise arbitrary users in the system could pre-create this directory as long as cannaserver is not running, and cannaserver would be using an unsafe directory for placing its socket.  cannaserver itself is attempting to create /tmp/.iroha_unix during startup but tolerates if the directory already exists. It does not run a sanity check on the permissions of this directory, however, so it will happily use an unsafe one. cannaserver does *not* clean up an already existing socket in this directory, however, it will fail to start instead if the socket already exists.  The latter was the cause for [bug 910933](show_bug.cgi?id=910933 "RESOLVED FIXED - Canna can not start") which has been fixed by changing the canna.service unit like this:  canna.service:  ``` ExecPre=/bin/rm -rf /tmp/.iroha_unix ExecStart=/usr/sbin/cannaserver -s -u wnn -r /var/lib/canna ExecStopPost=/bin/rm -rf /tmp/.iroha_unix ```  This counteracts the initial idea of the systemd-tmpfiles configuration, because now there exist time windows again when /tmp/.iroha_unix is *not* existing, allowing other local users an attack.  I tested an exploit and it is easily possible to wait for /tmp/.iroha_unix to be delete via `inotify_wait()` and then create a world-writable directory of mode 777 but owned by the attacker in its stead. cannaserver will then create its socket in the unsafe directory, the attacker can delete the socket again and place its own fake socket there. This means the attacker can intercept client connections and receive their input data and return back manipulated data.  I will suggest a fix for this soon. A proper long-term fix is to to change the directory to /run/canna, there arbitrary users won't be able to stage attacks. For this the Canna.conf file in the build tree would need to be patched to change the UnixSockDir setting appropriately.  In this form this is more like a SUSE specific bug. Upstream has no systemd service files and doesn't seem to suggest any integration for Linux. The default value for UnixSockDir is a bad one, however. Also there could be more hardening like sanity checking the socket directory's permissions at startup. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1199280#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-05-06 13:38:43 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 858707](attachment.cgi?id=858707&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=858707&action=edit) draft patch to move socket directory to /run/canna ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1199280#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-05-06 13:39:24 UTC  ``` The patch in [attachment 858707](attachment.cgi?id=858707&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=858707&action=edit) is a suggestion on how to fix this. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1199280#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2022-05-09 13:25:13 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-21950 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1199280#c4)  Cathy Hu   2022-05-11 09:29:56 UTC  ``` Affected:  - SUSE:SLE-12:Update/canna              3.7p3  - openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP3/canna   3.7p3  - openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP4/canna   3.7p3  - openSUSE:Factory/canna                3.7p3 ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1199280#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-05-12 07:36:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to cathy.hu@suse.com from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1199280#c4)) > Affected: >  - SUSE:SLE-12:Update/canna              3.7p3  I don't think SLE-12 is affected, since the `ExecPre` and `ExecStopPost` lines are missing from the service file there. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1199280#c6)  Cathy Hu   2022-05-12 08:01:04 UTC  ``` Ah thanks, yes you are right.
