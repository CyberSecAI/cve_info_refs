### @blag **[blag](/blag)** commented [Jan 7, 2022](#issue-1095990233)

### Description

This PR moves one line around so the `user.last_login` field is only updated when the user has successfully authenticated.

Without this PR the `user.last_login` field is not very useful, as an attacker trying to brute force a login would continuously update the `last_login` field to the datetime of the latest *unsuccessful* authentication attempt, instead of the datetime of the last successful authentication attempt. I believe that "login" usually refers to a successful authentication attempt, so this keeps the behavior of the code consistent with the semantics of the field name.

I don't have a thorough understanding of what all `user.last_login` could be/is used for, but I can imagine that, when it records the last datetime of successful authentication attempt, it can be combined with `user.fail_login_count` to generate an average "brute force rate" for each user between successful logins. Without this PR, it is impossible to collect that data because the `user.last_login` will almost always be set to the datetime of the latest brute force attempt.

I have expanded the docstring to have a more thorough description of the method, and I have added tests for each line and branch of the `BaseSecurityManager.update_user_auth_stat` method so it is now completely covered by tests.

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

* Has associated issue:
* Is CRUD MVC related.
* Is Auth, RBAC security related.
* Changes the security db schema.
* Introduces new feature
* Removes existing feature

Sorry, something went wrong.
