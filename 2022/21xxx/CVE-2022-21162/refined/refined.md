**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a user with local access to the system.
- The attacker must be authenticated on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious file in a location that will be searched by the vulnerable tool.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Intel® HDMI Firmware Update Tool for NUC before 1.79.1.1.
- The advisory also mentions CVE-2022-40971, which is a separate vulnerability related to incorrect default permissions in the same tool.
- Intel recommends updating to version 1.79.1.1 or later to mitigate both vulnerabilities.
