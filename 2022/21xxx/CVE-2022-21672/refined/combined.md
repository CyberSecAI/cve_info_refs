# /etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs include distrusted certificates

Moderate

[xry111](/xry111)
published
GHSA-m5qh-728v-4xrx
Jan 10, 2022

## Package

make-ca
(BLFS)

## Affected versions

>= 0.9, < 1.10

## Patched versions

1.10

## Description

### Impact

make-ca misinterprets Mozilla certdata.txt and treats explicitly untrusted certificates like trusted ones, causing those explicitly untrusted certificates trusted by the system. The explicitly untrusted certificates were used by some CAs already hacked. Hostile attackers may perform a MIM attack exploiting them.

### Patches

Everyone using the affected versions of make-ca should upgrade to make-ca-1.10, and run `make-ca -r` as the `root` user to regenerate the trusted store immediately.

### Workarounds

Users may delete the untrusted certificates from /etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs manually (or by a script), but this is not recommended because the manual changes will be overwritten next time running make-ca to update the trusted anchor.

### **[xry111](/xry111)** commented [Jan 8, 2022](#issue-1096962233)

| Reported by Robert Bartel via blfs-dev, and it also happens on my system:  Just recently I noticed that the /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt generated by make-ca 1.9 includes two explicitly distrusted certificates as indicated by their comments:  ``` # Explicitly Distrust DigiNotar Root CA # Explicitly Distrusted DigiNotar PKIoverheid G2  ```  It seems to me that p11-kit and OpenSSL can explicitly distrust certificates in their CA stores for various usage purposes while the PEM bundle format (ca-bundle.crt) used mainly by GnuTLS does not support this. So my interpretation is that all applications using the bundles will trust these bad certificates.  As make-ca uses p11-kit's "trust extract" utility to generate the PEM bundles, I looked in trust/extract-pem.c of p11-kit 0.24. Here it looks like it iterates over all certificates in the CA store and the trust status is only indicated by the generated comment line. But I could be wrong.  I'm not wanting to create a GitHub account right now to report the issue to the p11-kit project, so I first ask here if anyone can confirm or reject this?  For the time being I resorted to remove the bad certificates by using the following command line:  ``` for file in /etc/pki/tls/certs/*.crt; do     awk -- '/^# Explicitly Distrust/    { delcert = 1 }         !delcert                        { print }         /^-----END/                     { delcert = 0 }' "${file}" >"${file}.tmp"         mv -vf "${file}.tmp" "${file}"         chmod -v 444 "${file}" done  ```  Thank you for reading this and keep up the good work! |
