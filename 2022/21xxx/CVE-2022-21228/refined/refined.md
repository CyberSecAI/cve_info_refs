- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The advisory does not specify the exact attack vector, but notes that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker needs to convince a user to perform a specific action that triggers the vulnerability, implying a need for user interaction (UI:R).
