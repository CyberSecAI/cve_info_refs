|  |  | \*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects\* |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* access\_log: fix memory leak when reopening an access log fails. Access logs will now try to be reopened on each subsequent flush attempt after a failure. |
|  |  | \* data plane: fix crash when internal redirect selects a route configured with direct response or redirect actions. |
|  |  | \* data plane: fixing error handling where writing to a socket failed while under the stack of processing. This should genreally affect HTTP/3. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable\_features.allow\_upstream\_inline\_write`` to false. |
|  |  | \* eds: fix the eds cluster update by allowing update on the locality of the cluster endpoints. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable\_features.support\_locality\_update\_on\_eds\_cluster\_endpoints`` to false. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
