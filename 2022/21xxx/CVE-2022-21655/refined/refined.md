Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of internal redirects within the Envoy proxy when the route selected after an internal redirect is configured with a "direct response entry".  This leads to a null pointer dereference and a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Logic:** The core issue is in how Envoy handles the selection of routes after an internal redirect, specifically when the chosen route is a "direct response entry" (a route that sends a pre-configured response without going upstream).
*  **Null Pointer Dereference:** The vulnerability manifests as a segmentation fault (segfault) due to a null pointer dereference. The code attempts to access a member of the route entry but fails when it is a direct response entry.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a crash (segfault) of the Envoy proxy, effectively resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network based, meaning an attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely through network requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction.
*   **Ability to send requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Envoy proxy that trigger an internal redirect to a route configured with direct response entry.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Envoy instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Envoy versions 1.21.0 and earlier are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** Fixed in versions 1.18.6, 1.19.3, 1.20.2, and 1.21.1.
*   **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
*   **Workaround:**  A workaround is to disable internal redirects if direct response entries are configured on the same listener.
* The fix involves checking for a direct response entry and using the correct route name.
