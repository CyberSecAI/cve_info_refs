# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1444

## Lansweeper lansweeper AssetActions.aspx SQL injection vulnerability

##### February 28, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-21210

### Summary

An SQL injection vulnerability exists in the AssetActions.aspx functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 9.1.20.2. A specially crafted HTTP request can cause SQL injection. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Lansweeper lansweeper 9.1.20.2

### Product URLs

lansweeper - <https://www.lansweeper.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.6 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

### CWE

CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’)

### Details

Lansweeper is an IT Asset Management solution that gathers hardware and software information of computers and other devices on a computer network for management and compliance and audit purposes.

An exploitable SQL Injection vulnerability is related to an `fieldSelect` parameter passed to : `/AssetActions.aspx` script.
Let us take a close look at the vulnerable source code :

```
LS\WS\AssetActions.cs

Line 743	else if (page.IsPostBack && current.Request["action"] == "assetfieldschange")
Line 744	{
Line 745		User.Current().CheckRoleRedirect(Permission.EditData);
Line 746		General.ValidateCsrf();
Line 747		JsReturnObject jsReturnObject8 = new JsReturnObject();
Line 748		try
Line 749		{
Line 750			string[] array9 = current.Request["fieldselect"].Split(',');
(...)
Line 828					foreach (string text38 in array9)
Line 828				     {
(...)
Line 919           				default:
Line 920                              DB.ExecuteDataset("UPDATE tblAssetCustom SET " + text38 + " = @data, Lastchanged = GETDATE() WHERE AssetID=@aid", DB.NewDBParameter("@data", text41), DB.NewDBParameter("@aid", item10.Key));

```

`fieldSelect` parameter is provided by the user and is not sanitized at all. In `line 920` we can notice that `fieldSelect` is concatenated with the SQL query string in a regular way which leads to SQL injection.
To trigger this vulnerability an attacker must be authenticated and have proper permissions.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

PoC presents abuse of descibed SQL Injection to set `@@version` varabile value to `Comments` field of all assets
