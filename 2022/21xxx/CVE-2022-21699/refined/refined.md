    "CVE-2022-21699": {
      "status": "Relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "IPython executes untrusted files located in the current working directory, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges",
          "CWE-250",
          "CWE-269",
          "CWE-279"
        ],
        "impact": "Arbitrary code execution, allowing one user to run code as another.",
        "attack_vectors": "An attacker places a malicious file in a directory that the victim user will cd into and launch ipython.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create files in a location where the victim user will navigate with `cd` command before running IPython. No special privileges are needed beyond basic user ability to create files and folders.",
           "additional_info": "The vulnerability stems from IPython searching for profiles and configurations in the current working directory. This behavior, which was initially for project-dependent code loading, has become a security risk and was disabled. Proof of concept includes a vulnerable user creates a malicious `profile_default/startup/foo.py` script, a second user will execute the script just by opening `ipython` from the vulnerable directory."
