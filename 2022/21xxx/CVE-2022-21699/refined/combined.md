# Execution with Unnecessary Privileges in ipython

High

[Carreau](/Carreau)
published
GHSA-pq7m-3gw7-gq5x
Jan 19, 2022

## Package

pip

ipython
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

All version prior and including to 8.0.0, 7.31.0, 5.10

## Patched versions

8.0.1, 7.31.1, 7.16.3, 5.11 (source only)

## Description

We’d like to disclose an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in IPython that stems from IPython executing untrusted files in CWD. This vulnerability allows one user to run code as another.

Proof of concept

User1:

```
mkdir -m 777 /tmp/profile_default
mkdir -m 777 /tmp/profile_default/startup
echo 'print("stealing your private secrets")' > /tmp/profile_default/startup/foo.py

```

User2:

```
cd /tmp
ipython

```

User2 will see:

```
Python 3.9.7 (default, Oct 25 2021, 01:04:21)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.29.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
stealing your private secrets

```
## Patched release and documentation

See <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version8.html#ipython-8-0-1-cve-2022-21699>,

Version 8.0.1, 7.31.1 for current Python version are recommended.

Version 7.16.3 has also been published for Python 3.6 users,

Version 5.11 (source only, 5.x branch on github) for older Python versions.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## IPython: Productive Interactive Computing

### Overview

Welcome to IPython. Our full documentation is available on [ipython.readthedocs.io](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and contains information on how to install, use, and
contribute to the project.
IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history.

**IPython versions and Python Support**

Starting after IPython 8.16, we will progressively transition to [Spec-0000](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/).

Starting with IPython 7.10, IPython follows [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)

**IPython 7.17+** requires Python version 3.7 and above.

**IPython 7.10+** requires Python version 3.6 and above.

**IPython 7.0** requires Python version 3.5 and above.

**IPython 6.x** requires Python version 3.3 and above.

**IPython 5.x LTS** is the compatible release for Python 2.7.
If you require Python 2 support, you **must** use IPython 5.x LTS. Please
update your project configurations and requirements as necessary.

The Notebook, Qt console and a number of other pieces are now parts of *Jupyter*.
See the [Jupyter installation docs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
if you want to use these.

### Main features of IPython

Comprehensive object introspection.

Input history, persistent across sessions.

Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated references.

Extensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.

Extensible system of ‘magic’ commands for controlling the environment and performing many tasks related to IPython or the operating system.

A rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).

Session logging and reloading.

Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.

Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.

Easily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.

Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.

### Development and Instant running

You can find the latest version of the development documentation on [readthedocs](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal:

```
$ python -m IPython

```

Or see the [development installation docs](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/install.html#installing-the-development-version)
for the latest revision on read the docs.

Documentation and installation instructions for older version of IPython can be
found on the [IPython website](https://ipython.org/documentation.html)

### Alternatives to IPython

IPython may not be to your taste; if that's the case there might be similar
project that you might want to use:

* The classic Python REPL.
* [bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/)
* [mypython](https://www.asmeurer.com/mypython/)
* [ptpython and ptipython](https://pypi.org/project/ptpython/)
* [Xonsh](https://xon.sh/)

### Ignoring commits with git blame.ignoreRevsFile

As of git 2.23, it is possible to make formatting changes without breaking
`git blame`. See the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile)
for more details.

To use this feature you must:

* Install git >= 2.23
* Configure your local git repo by running:
  + POSIX: `tools\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.sh`
  + Windows: `tools\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.bat`

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-b9e38f8a56
2022-02-12 01:14:11.929209
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : ipython
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 7.20.0
Release : 2.fc34
URL : <http://ipython.org/>

IPython provides a replacement for the interactive Python interpreter with
extra functionality.

Main features:
\* Comprehensive object introspection.
\* Input history, persistent across sessions.
\* Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
references.
\* Readline based name completion.
\* Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.
\* Configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler
than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).
\* Session logging and reloading.
\* Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.
\* Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.
\* Easily embeddable in other Python programs.
\* Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Package        : ipython
Version        : 5.1.0-3+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-21699
Debian Bug     : #1004122

It was discovered that there was a potential arbitrary code execution
vulnerability in IPython, the interactive Python shell.

This issue stemmed from IPython executing untrusted files in the
current working directory. According to upstream:

  Almost all versions of IPython looks for configuration and profiles
  in current working directory. Since IPython was developed before
  pip and environments existed, it was used a convenient way to load
  code/packages in a project dependant way.

  In 2022, it is not necessary anymore, and can lead to confusing
  behavior where for example cloning a repository and starting
  IPython or loading a notebook from any Jupyter-Compatible interface
  that has ipython set as a kernel can lead to code execution.

To address this problem, the current working directory is no longer
searched for profiles or configuration files.

For Debian 9 "Stretch", this problem has been fixed in version
5.1.0-3+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ipython packages.

For the detailed security status of ipython please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ipython>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

|  |  | ============ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | IPython 8.0.1 (CVE-2022-21699) |
|  |  | ------------------------------ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | IPython 8.0.1, 7.31.1 and 5.11 are security releases that change some default |
|  |  | values in order to prevent potential Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Almost all version of IPython looks for configuration and profiles in current |
|  |  | working directory. Since IPython was developed before pip and environments |
|  |  | existed it was used a convenient way to load code/packages in a project |
|  |  | dependant way. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In 2022, it is not necessary anymore, and can lead to confusing behavior where |
|  |  | for example cloning a repository and starting IPython or loading a notebook from |
|  |  | any Jupyter-Compatible interface that has ipython set as a kernel can lead to |
|  |  | code execution. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | I did not find any standard way for packaged to advertise CVEs they fix, I'm |
|  |  | thus trying to add a ``\_\_patched\_cves\_\_`` attribute to the IPython module that |
|  |  | list the CVEs that should have been fixed. This attribute is informational only |
|  |  | as if a executable has a flaw, this value can always be changed by an attacker. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | .. code:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In [1]: import IPython |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In [2]: IPython.\_\_patched\_cves\_\_ |
|  |  | Out[2]: {'CVE-2022-21699'} |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In [3]: 'CVE-2022-21699' in IPython.\_\_patched\_cves\_\_ |
|  |  | Out[3]: True |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Thus starting with this version: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - The current working directory is not searched anymore for profiles or |
|  |  | configurations files. |
|  |  | - Added a ``\_\_patched\_cves\_\_`` attribute (set of strings) to IPython module that contain |
|  |  | the list of fixed CVE. This is informational only. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Further details can be read on the `GitHub Advisory <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/security/advisories/GHSA-pq7m-3gw7-gq5x>`\_\_ |

Important

This documentation covers IPython versions 6.0 and higher. Beginning with
version 6.0, IPython stopped supporting compatibility with Python versions
lower than 3.3 including all versions of Python 2.7.

If you are looking for an IPython version compatible with Python 2.7,
please use the IPython 5.x LTS release and refer to its documentation (LTS
is the long term support release).

# 8.x Series[](#x-series "Link to this heading")

## IPython 8.31[](#ipython-8-31 "Link to this heading")

Small release for this end of december; This release contains only two notable changes:

> * [PR #14594](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14594/) Fix completion in tuples, where the completion was
>   suggesting tuples methods instead of methods and attributes of the current
>   element.
> * [PR #14598](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14598/) Fix pdb issue with Python 3.13.1, this fix is not perfect
>   (see [#14620](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/14620/)) but should be sufficient for now.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.31](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/138?closed=1) milestone.

### Road to 9.0[](#road-to-9-0 "Link to this heading")

The current main branch is now on it’s way to be 9.0; do not expect many new
features but a large codebase refactor, and cleanup with many deprecated code
removed, and more agressive codestyle enforcement.

### For something completely different[](#for-something-completely-different "Link to this heading")

[Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether) was a German
mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and
theoretical physics. Her work on Noether’s theorem, which describes the
relationship between symmetries and conservation laws, has had a profound impact
on the development of modern physics. Noether’s work was largely overlooked
during her lifetime, but her legacy as one of the most important mathematicians
of the 20th century has been recognized and celebrated in recent years.

### Thanks[](#thanks "Link to this heading")

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.30[](#ipython-8-30 "Link to this heading")

Small release for this end of november;

> * [PR #14579](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14579/) improve the documentatation for custom IPython formatters, and how
>   you can register formatters for custom mime types.
> * [PR #14580](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14580/) fix a bug in which commands that were not assigned a shortcut
>   could not be assigned one.
> * [PR #12690](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12690/) fix a bug in which a single `/` on an empty line would not be
>   an error. This is due to the `autocall` behavior that we are thinking of
>   deprecating.

The rest of the PRs are mostly maintenance and documentation improvements.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.30](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/137?closed=1) milestone.

### For something completely different[](#id1 "Link to this heading")

[Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) is considered the
first computer programmer. In the 1840s, she wrote what is recognized as the
first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine - Charles Babbage’s
proposed Analytical Engine. Her notes included what would today be called a
computer program, making her the first programmer in history. She also uniquely
understood that computers could go beyond mere calculation and could be used to
create music or art - a visionary insight that was far ahead of her time.
Despite living in an era when women had limited access to scientific education,
she made groundbreaking contributions that laid the foundation for modern
computing.

### Thanks[](#id2 "Link to this heading")

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.29[](#ipython-8-29 "Link to this heading")

Medium release for this end of october;

> * Misc Python 3.13 compatibility [PR #14536](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14536/), [PR #14559](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14559/)
> * Add a `uv` line magic [PR #14537](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14537/)
> * Add support for WEBP to `IPython.display.Image`. [PR #14526](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14526/)
> * And many more bugfixes and quality of life improvements.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.29](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/136?closed=1) milestone.

### Preparing for 9.0[](#preparing-for-9-0 "Link to this heading")

IPython 3.13 was released earlier this month, and this means that according to
[Spec-0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/), support for 3.10
will end soon.

There have been many minor version of IPython 8.x, so it is likely that one of
the next version will simply bump to 9.0 and remove a lot of code mark as
deprecated, and documentation/examples not relevant for terminal IPython.

The frequency of release and my time reviewing will also likely decrease more
than it has already.

### For something completely different[](#id3 "Link to this heading")

[Rosalind Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin) made
some of the biggest contribution to the discovery of the helix structure of DNA.
Unfortunately her work was [not recognized](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/rosalind-franklin-a-crucial-contribution-6538012/)

### Thanks[](#id4 "Link to this heading")

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.28[](#ipython-8-28 "Link to this heading")

Slight delay of this September release as I was busy at Pydata Paris last week.
Not many user visible changes for this release, a couple of bug fixes and
workaround:

> * [PR #14480](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14480/) AssertionError: assert \_xterm\_term\_title\_saved in WSL – It is
>   unclear why the terminal title is not saved in WSL, if you’ve WSL experience
>   we’d love your feedback and help to not just ignore an error
> * [PR #14510](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14510/) Fix use of pyside6 >= 6.7.0
> * [PR #14518](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14518/) Make values public (\_tb\_highlight & \_tb\_highlight\_style)
> * [PR #14515](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14515/) Use environment variable to identify conda / mamba

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.28](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/135?closed=1) milestone.

### For something completely different[](#id5 "Link to this heading")

One of the first works of Science Fiction ([Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein)), was written by [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley) when she was 18, before being
published in London on 1 January 1818 when she was 20. This is often overlooked,
and the role of founders of science fiction attribute to Edgar Allan Poe and
Jules Verne despite being published later.

### Thanks[](#id6 "Link to this heading")

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.27[](#ipython-8-27 "Link to this heading")

New release of IPython after a month off (not enough changes). We can see a few
important changes for this release.

> * autocall was being call getitem, [PR #14486](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14486/)
> * Only copy files in startup dir if we just created it. [PR #14497](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14497/)
> * Fix some tests on Python 3.13 RC1 [PR #14504](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14504/); this one I guess make this
>   the first IPython release officially compatible with Python 3.13; you will
>   need the most recent `executing` and `stack_data`, we won’t pin to avoid
>   forcing user of older Python version to upgrade.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.27](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/134?closed=1) milestone.

### Thanks[](#id7 "Link to this heading")

Many thanks to [@Kleirre](https://github.com/Kleirre) our June intern for
doing her first contribution to open source, doing the releases notes and
release. I guess you didn’t even notice it was not me who released :-). I wish
her all the best in her future endeavor and look forward for her work in
astrophysics.

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

Mostly internal changes for this end of may release of IPython.

We’ll count about a dozen PRs for this moth, with small bugfixes related to
matplotlib fixes.

Of notable interest,

> * [PR #14426](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14426/) replaces the unicode micro symbol with greek letter mu,
>   visually identical but should fix nfkc normalisations issues.
> * [PR #14444](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14444/) introduces `intersphinx_registry` as a new dependency

The biggest change is the move of the matplotlib backend handling from IPython
to matplotlib. [PR #14371](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14371/) [PR #14403](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14403/).

We will note:

> * Attempt to speed running code under debugger in some cases. [PR #14386](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14386/)
>   [PR #14418](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14418/).
> * Multiple fixes to documentation for ipyparallel, simple\_prompt and emacs
>   [PR #14384](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14384/) [PR #14404](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14404/) [PR #14407](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14407/)

## IPython 8.23[](#ipython-8-23 "Link to this heading")

Super tiny release of IPython on Sunday – a bit later than usual, which is also
[🏳️‍⚧️ International Transgender Day of Visibility🏳️‍⚧️](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Transgender_Day_of_Visibility) –
so a though for you on this day, you matter and you are valid [[1]](#id18).

This is a minuscule release with only 5 Pull requests.

Main change is [PR #14357](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14357/) which improve inference from return type
annotations in completer and the introduction of the optional target
`ipython[matplotlib]` to explicitly request the matplotlib optional
dependencies.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.23](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/130?closed=1) milestone.

Quick release of IPython for this short month of February, with quite a bit of
activity with more than 15 PRs.

I am not going to details all the changes, but among other we have :

> * More compatibility with emscripten [PR #14316](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14316/), [PR #14318](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14318/),

> * Fix issues with multiple call to `matplotlib.pyplot.switch_backend`
> * Fix crashing IPython when some tracebacks encounter dynamically evaluated
>   code.

IPython 8.22.1 increase the minimal traitlets version, and 8.22.2 fix a critical
bug on emscripten preventing to use some magics like `%matplotlib` on
jupyter-light.

### API changes[](#api-changes "Link to this heading")

One of the largest change is the update the mimehooks and inspector API, see
[PR #14342](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14342/). It should be backward compatible, but many hooks now receive a
single object with many fields allowing us flexibility to update the API later.

### Packaging changes[](#packaging-changes "Link to this heading")

Thanks to [@mkoppe](https://github.com/mkoeppe), we are slowly getting rid of
setup.py finally migrating to `pyproject.toml`. There is still quite a bit of
work, and please open an issue if you encounter any problem.

### Deprecation[](#deprecation "Link to this heading")

A number of unused functions have been marked deprecated or pending deprecation.
Please let us know if you encounter any of those deprecation messages for us to
adjust the removal timeline.

### Thanks[](#id13 "Link to this heading")

Many thanks to [@mkoppe](https://github.com/mkoeppe) and [@krassowski](https://github.com/krassowski) for their multiple contributions and codebase
cleanup.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.22](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/129?closed=1) milestone.

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.21[](#ipython-8-21 "Link to this heading")

More substantial release of IPython slightly out of schedule as it was not
possible for me to make a release last Friday.

Few new features are present, but the codebase has been cleaned, and a couple
of API are \_considered\_ for deprecation. They are not deprecated yet, but as
they do not seem to be quite used, they may emit a warning, in which case please
comment on the relevant issue to inform me of \_which\_ project use those feature
and how you use them. Depending on the feedback I might change the timeline for
deprecation.

This release saw 14 PRs, with more outside contribution than usual,
I’ll note in particular PRs related to making IPython work on emscripten.

I also want to point that we are \_trying\_ to keep compatibility with Python 3.13,
but it’s a cat and mouse game. Plus I am low on time, so I would appreciate any
help with that.

### Deprecations[](#deprecations "Link to this heading")

> * [PR #14307](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14307/) Pending Deprecation of
>   `ColorSchemeTable.set_active_scheme(...)`’s `case_sensitive` Parameter.
> * [PR #14305](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14305/) Pending Deprecation of constructing `ColorScheme` via
>   `kwargs`, in favor passing a single dict.

### Fixes[](#fixes "Link to this heading")

> * [PR #14284](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14284/) TerminalIPythonApp’s would warn that `auto_create` option is not
>   recognized.
> * [PR #14286](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14286/) Fix a crash with `NotOneValueFound` when rendering complex
>   tracebacks.
> * [PR #14287](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14287/) Partial Python 3.13 compatibility
> * [PR #14290](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14290/) Docs/Typos.

#### Changes[](#changes "Link to this heading")

> * [PR #14289](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14289/) `ipdb.set_trace()` now accepts `header=` for better
>   compatibility with `pdb.set_trace()`
> * [PR #14300](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14300/) and [PR #14301](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14301/) Add hooking ability to produce
>   mimebundle.

We’ll outline [PR #14300](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14300/), it is now possible to extend the `?/??`
operator to return more mimetypes to render richer help in frontends that
support it. In particular you could send a json representation of the help that
could be displayed in a customizable way.

### Miscellaneous[](#miscellaneous "Link to this heading")

> * [PR #14291](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14291/) Misc Refactor of Color handling
> * [PR #14295](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14295/) Misc test skip on problematic Pypy versions.

#### Thanks[](#id14 "Link to this heading")

Special thanks to all our contributors, and to the Pypy team that was extremely
reactive in helping to investigate a fixing a rare unicode+windows bug.

work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.20[](#ipython-8-20 "Link to this heading")

Quick IPython release in this beginning of 2024, barely 2 weeks after the previous
release.

This is mostly to fix a backward compatibility issue, I would have done a patch
release earlier if I could. As a few other cleanup are also part of this
release, this will get a minor version bump.

The crux of this release is [PR #14274](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14274/) (Inspect continuation prompt
signature and pass only viable arguments), the rest of the changes are mostly
type annotation, and a few compatibility issues with Python 3.13 that are
getting addressed.

Python 3.13 compatibility is still not complete (help welcomed).

## IPython 8.19[](#ipython-8-19 "Link to this heading")

New release of IPython a bit before the end of the month, and end of the year.

Mostly cleanup and deprecation, due to upstream deprecation and removal.

### Remove of Python 3.9 support[](#remove-of-python-3-9-support "Link to this heading")

A bit later than originally plan, IPython 8.19 does not support Python 3.9
anymore, as well as the few conditional code that were executing only on Python
3.9. [PR #14254](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14254/)

We used the opportunity to deprecate `IPython.utils.tz` [PR #14256](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14256/), due
to upstream deprecation of some timezone utilities. It will be removed at a later
date.

We now also run CI on Python 3.12 (what I likely should have done before), but
running on too many Python version uses a lot of CI time.

### Absolute and relative Line Numbers in Prompts[](#absolute-and-relative-line-numbers-in-prompts "Link to this heading")

Thanks to the contribution of `cohml`, IPython CLI now support absolute and
relative line numbers in both vi and emacs prompt, use for example
`c.TerminalInteractiveShell.prompt_line_number_format='{line: 4d}/{rel_line:+03d} | '`
configuration option to display both in a custom format.

### Miscellaneous[](#id15 "Link to this heading")

In addition to various bugfixes, I unpinned pytest, let me know if there are any
issues and we’ll re-pin.

### See you in 2024[](#see-you-in-2024 "Link to this heading")

## IPython 8.17, 8.17.1[](#ipython-8-17-8-17-1 "Link to this heading")

Medium-sized release of IPython that includes some cleanup (backcall, python2 leftovers)
and some refactoring improvements (typing, pathlib) and a fix on completion.

> * [PR #14216](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14216/) remove backcall dependency
> * [PR #14217](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14217/) make pickleshare dependency optional

Reverted in 8.17.1:

> * [PR #14190](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14190/) remove support for python 2 in lexers (reverted in 8.17.1 as it is imported by qtconsole/spyder)

### Mamba and Micromamba magic commands[](#mamba-and-micromamba-magic-commands "Link to this heading")

In addition to the `%conda` magic command for calling `conda` in IPython,
the `%mamba` and `%micromamba` magic commands now
call `mamba` and `micromamba` if they are on `sys.path`.

```
%mamba install pkgname
%micromamba install pkgname
%conda install pkgname

### Support for PEP-678 Exception Notes[](#support-for-pep-678-exception-notes "Link to this heading")

Ultratb now shows [**PEP 678**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/) notes, improving your debugging experience on
Python 3.11+ or with libraries such as Pytest and Hypothesis.

### Native fallback for displaying ExceptionGroup[](#native-fallback-for-displaying-exceptiongroup "Link to this heading")

ExceptionGroups are now displayed with `traceback.print_exc`, as a temporary fix until UltraTB properly supports displaying child exceptions.

We have two larger features:

### AST-based macros[](#ast-based-macros "Link to this heading")

[PR #14100](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14100/) introduce a new and efficient way to modify each execution block
(cell) using an template-ast-based transform. Unlike IPython pre and post code
execution hooks, this actually transform the code that is execute with as
minimal as possible overhead. While it was already technically possible to
register ast transformers for IPython this was far from evident.

This should make it trivial to hook into IPython to implement custom hooks, that
for example time or profile your code, catch exceptions to provide error
messages for students or do any other kind of transformations.

In addition to programmatic API there is also a magic to quickly register
hooks:

```
In [1]: %%code_wrap before_after
   ...: print('before')
   ...: __code__
   ...: print('after')
   ...: __ret__

```

This mean that for any subsequent execution code will be executed.
You can modify the above to print the date, compute the execution time,
retry the code in a for loop….

### Allow IPdb/Pdb to move between chained exceptions[](#allow-ipdb-pdb-to-move-between-chained-exceptions "Link to this heading")

The main change is the addition of the ability to move between chained
exceptions when using IPdb, this feature was also contributed to upstream Pdb
and is thus native to CPython in Python 3.13+ Though ipdb should support this
feature in older version of Python. I invite you to look at the [CPython changes
and docs](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/106676) for more details.

In short, once in post-mortem debugger (`%debug`), you can use the ipdb
`exceptions` command to switch exceptions, for example:

```
In [1]: def foo(x):
    ...:     try:
    ...:         bar(x)
    ...:     except Exception as e:
    ...:         raise ValueError("foo (): bar failed") from e
    ...:
    ...: def bar(x):
    ...:     1 / X
    ...:

In [2]: foo(0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[1], line 3, in foo(x)
      2 try:
----> 3     bar(x)
      4 except Exception as e:

Cell In[1], line 9, in bar(x)
      8 def bar(x):
----> 9     1 / X

NameError: name 'X' is not defined

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[2], line 1
----> 1 foo(0)

Cell In[1], line 5, in foo(x)
      3     bar(x)
      4 except Exception as e:
----> 5     raise ValueError("foo (): bar failed") from e

ValueError: foo (): bar failed

In [3]: %debug
> <ipython-input-1-b0bbdc271ffb>(5)foo()
      3         bar(x)
      4     except Exception as e:
----> 5         raise ValueError("foo (): bar failed") from e

```

In previous ipdb you could not go into the bar error, now from within pdb you
can use `exceptions`:

```
ipdb> exceptions
    0 NameError("name 'X' is not defined")
>   1 ValueError('foo (): bar failed')

ipdb> exceptions 0
> <ipython-input-1-b0bbdc271ffb>(9)bar()
      6
      7
      8 def bar(x):
----> 9     1 / X
     10

ipdb>

```

In particular I want to thank the [D.E. Shaw group](https://www.deshaw.com/)
for suggesting and funding the two largest feature as well as many bug fixes of
this release.

### SPEC 0 and SPEC 4[](#spec-0-and-spec-4 "Link to this heading")

You’ve heard about the NEPs, (NumPy enhancement Proposal), having a NEP for something non-numpy specific was sometime confusing.
Long live the [SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/).

We are now trying to follow SPEC 0 (aka old NEP 29) for support of upstream libraries.

We also now try to follow SPEC 4 (test and publish nightly on a centralized nightly repository).
We encourage you to do so as well in order to report breakage, and contribute to the SPEC process !

### Python 3.12 compatibility ?[](#python-3-12-compatibility "Link to this heading")

Python 3.12 changed its tokenizer to have better support for f-strings and allow arbitrary expression.
This is a great new feature and performance improvement in Python 3.12.

Unfortunately this means the new tokenizer does not support incomplete or invalid Python which will
break many features of IPython. Thus compatibility of IPython with Python 3.12 is not guaranteed.
It is unclear to which extent IPython is affected, and whether we can/should try to still support magics, shell
escape (`! ....`), …, as well as how to do it if we can.

In addition even if we there is technical feasibility to do so, it is no clear we have the resources to do it.
We are thus looking for your help if you can \_test\_ on Python 3.12 to see to which extent this affects users and which
features are critical.

We are not going to pin IPython to Python `<3.12` as otherwise on install pip would downgrade/resolve to IPython 8.13,
so if you plan to update to Python 3.12 after its release, we encourage for extra care.

## IPython 8.13.1, 8.13.2 and 8.12.2[](#ipython-8-13-1-8-13-2-and-8-12-2 "Link to this heading")

3 quick in succession patch release of IPython in addition to IPython 8.13.0
having been yanked.

IPython 8.13.0 was improperly tagged as still compatible with Python 3.8, and
still had some mention of compatibility with 3.8. IPython 8.13.1 is identical to
8.13 but with the exception of being correctly tagged. This release and yank was
mostly done to fix CI.

IPython 8.12.2 and 8.13.2 contain UI fixes, with respect to right arrow not
working in some case in the terminal, and 8.12.2 contain also a requested
backport of [PR #14029](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14029/) (Allow safe access to the `__getattribute__`
method of modules) for tab completion.

## IPython 8.13[](#ipython-8-13 "Link to this heading")

As usual for the end of the month, minor release of IPython. This release is
significant in that it not only has a number of bugfixes, but also drop support
for Python 3.8 as per NEP 29 ([PR #14023](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14023/)).

All the critical bugfixes have been backported onto the 8.12.1 release (see
below). In addition to that went into 8.12.1 you’ll find:

> * Pretty representation for `Counter` has been fixed to match the Python one
>   and be in decreasing order. [PR #14032](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14032/)
> * Module completion is better when jedi is disabled [PR #14029](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14029/).
> * Improvement of `%%bash` magic that would get stuck [PR #14019](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14019/)

We hope you enjoy this release an will maybe see you at JupyterCon in less than
two weeks.

## IPython 8.12.1[](#ipython-8-12-1 "Link to this heading")

This is the twin release of IPython 8.13 that contain only critical UI and bug
fixes. The next minor version of IPython has dropped support for Python 3.8 – as
per Nep 29 and this IPython 8.12.x will now only receive bugfixes.

> * [PR #14004](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14004/) Fix a bug introduced in IPython 8.12 that crash when
>   inspecting some docstrings.
> * [PR #14010](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14010/) Fix fast traceback code that was not working in some case.

>   autosuggestions.
> * [PR #14033](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14033/) add back the ability to use `.get()` on OInfo object for
>   backward compatibility with h5py (this will be re-deprecated later, and h5py
>   will also get a fix).

## IPython 8.12[](#ipython-8-12 "Link to this heading")

Hopefully slightly early release for IPython 8.12. Last Thursday of the month,
even if I guess it’s likely already Friday somewhere in the pacific ocean.

A number of PRs and bug fixes this month with close to 20 PRs merged !

The IPython repo reached [PR #14000](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14000/) !! Actually the PR that create those exact release
note is [PR #14000](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/14000/). Ok, more issues and PR is not always better, and I’d
love to have more time to close issues and Pull Requests.

Let’s note that in less than 2 month JupyterCon is back, in Paris please visit
[jupytercon.com](https://jupytercon.com), and looking forward to see you
there.

Packagers should take note that `typing_extension` is now a mandatory dependency
for Python versions `<3.10`.

Let’s note also that according to [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html), It is soon time to
stop support for Python 3.8 that will be release more than 3 and 1/2 years ago:

```
On Apr 14, 2023 drop support for Python 3.8 (initially released on Oct 14, 2019)

```

Thus I am likely to stop advertising support for Python 3.8 in the next
release at the end of April.

Here are some miscellaneous updates of interest:

> * [PR #13957](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13957/) brings updates to the Qt integration, particularly for Qt6.

We want to thank the D.E. Shaw group for requesting and sponsoring the work on
the following big feature. We had productive discussions on how to best expose
this feature

### Dynamic documentation dispatch[](#dynamic-documentation-dispatch "Link to this heading")

We are experimenting with dynamic documentation dispatch for object attribute.
See [#13860](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/13860/). The goal is to allow object to define documentation for
their attributes, properties, even when those are dynamically defined with
`__getattr__`.

In particular when those objects are base types it can be useful to show the
documentation

```
In [1]: class User:
   ...:
   ...:     __custom_documentations__ = {
   ...:         "first": "The first name of the user.",
   ...:         "last": "The last name of the user.",
   ...:     }
   ...:
   ...:     first:str
   ...:     last:str
   ...:
   ...:     def __init__(self, first, last):
   ...:         self.first = first
   ...:         self.last = last
   ...:
   ...:     @property
   ...:     def full(self):
   ...:         """`self.first` and `self.last` joined by a space."""
   ...:         return self.first + " " + self.last
   ...:
   ...:
   ...: user = Person('Jane', 'Doe')

In [2]: user.first?
Type:            str
String form:     Jane
Length:          4
Docstring:       the first name of a the person object, a str
Class docstring:
....

In [3]: user.last?
Type:            str
String form:     Doe
Length:          3
Docstring:       the last name, also a str
...

```

We can see here the symmetry with IPython looking for the docstring on the
properties:

```
In [4]: user.full?
HERE
Type:        property
String form: <property object at 0x102bb15d0>
Docstring:   first and last join by a space

```

Note that while in the above example we use a static dictionary, libraries may
decide to use a custom object that define `__getitem__`, we caution against
using objects that would trigger computation to show documentation, but it is
sometime preferable for highly dynamic code that for example export ans API as
object.

## IPython 8.11[](#ipython-8-11 "Link to this heading")

Back on almost regular monthly schedule for IPython with end-of-month
really-late-Friday release to make sure some bugs are properly fixed.
Small addition of with a few new features, bugfix and UX improvements.

This is a non-exhaustive list, but among other you will find:

### Faster Traceback Highlighting[](#faster-traceback-highlighting "Link to this heading")

Resurrection of pre-IPython-8 traceback highlighting code.

Really long and complicated files were slow to highlight in traceback with
IPython 8 despite upstream improvement that make many case better. Therefore
starting with IPython 8.11 when one of the highlighted file is more than 10 000
line long by default, we’ll fallback to a faster path that does not have all the
features of highlighting failing AST nodes.

This can be configures by setting the value of
`IPython.code.ultratb.FAST_THRESHOLD` to an arbitrary low or large value.

### Autoreload verbosity[](#autoreload-verbosity "Link to this heading")

We introduce more descriptive names for the `%autoreload` parameter:

* `%autoreload now` (also `%autoreload`) - perform autoreload immediately.
* `%autoreload off` (also `%autoreload 0`) - turn off autoreload.
* `%autoreload explicit` (also `%autoreload 1`) - turn on autoreload only for modules
  whitelisted by `%aimport` statements.
* `%autoreload all` (also `%autoreload 2`) - turn on autoreload for all modules except those
  blacklisted by `%aimport` statements.
* `%autoreload complete` (also `%autoreload 3`) - all the features of `all` but also adding new
  objects from the imported modules (see
  IPython/extensions/tests/test\_autoreload.py::test\_autoload\_newly\_added\_objects).

The original designations (e.g. “2”) still work, and these new ones are case-insensitive.

Additionally, the option `--print` or `-p` can be added to the line to print the names of
modules being reloaded. Similarly, `--log` or `-l` will output the names to the logger at INFO
level. Both can be used simultaneously.

The parsing logic for `%aimport` is now improved such that modules can be whitelisted and
blacklisted in the same line, e.g. it’s now possible to call `%aimport os, -math` to include
`os` for `%autoreload explicit` and exclude `math` for modes `all` and `complete`.

### Terminal shortcuts customization[](#terminal-shortcuts-customization "Link to this heading")

Previously modifying shortcuts was only possible by hooking into startup files
and practically limited to adding new shortcuts or removing all shortcuts bound
to a specific key. This release enables users to override existing terminal
shortcuts, disable them or add new keybindings.

For example, to set the `right` to accept a single character of auto-suggestion
you could use:

```
my_shortcuts = [
    {
        "command": "IPython:auto_suggest.accept_character",
        "new_keys": ["right"]
    }
]
%config TerminalInteractiveShell.shortcuts = my_shortcuts

```

You can learn more in [`TerminalInteractiveShell.shortcuts`](../config/options/terminal.html#configtrait-TerminalInteractiveShell.shortcuts)
configuration reference.

### Miscellaneous[](#id16 "Link to this heading")

> * `%gui` should now support PySide6. [PR #13864](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13864/)
> * Cli shortcuts can now be configured [PR #13928](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13928/), see above.
>   (note that there might be an issue with prompt\_toolkit 3.0.37 and shortcut configuration).
> * Capture output should now respect `;` semicolon to suppress output.
>   [PR #13940](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13940/)
> * Base64 encoded images (in jupyter frontend), will not have trailing newlines.
>   [PR #13941](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13941/)

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.10[](#ipython-8-10 "Link to this heading")

Out of schedule release of IPython with minor fixes to patch a potential CVE-2023-24816.
This is a really low severity CVE that you most likely are not affected by unless:

> * You are on windows.
> * You have a custom build of Python without `_ctypes`
> * You cd or start IPython or Jupyter in untrusted directory which names may be
>   valid shell commands.

You can read more on [the advisory](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/security/advisories/GHSA-29gw-9793-fvw7).

In addition to fixing this CVE we also fix a couple of outstanding bugs and issues.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.10 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/112?closed=1).

In Particular:

> * bump minimum numpy to `>=1.21` version following NEP29. [PR #13930](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13930/)
> * fix for compatibility with MyPy 1.0. [PR #13933](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13933/)
> * fix nbgrader stalling when IPython’s `showtraceback` function is
>   monkeypatched. [PR #13934](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13934/)

As this release also contains those minimal changes in addition to fixing the
CVE I decided to bump the minor version anyway.

This will not affect the normal release schedule, so IPython 8.11 is due in
about 2 weeks.

## IPython 8.9.0[](#ipython-8-9-0 "Link to this heading")

Second release of IPython in 2023, last Friday of the month, we are back on
track. This is a small release with a few bug-fixes, and improvements, mostly
with respect to terminal shortcuts.

The biggest improvement for 8.9 is a drastic amelioration of the
auto-suggestions sponsored by D.E. Shaw and implemented by the more and more
active contributor [@krassowski](https://github.com/krassowski).

* `right` accepts a single character from suggestion
* `ctrl+right` accepts a semantic token (macos default shortcuts take
  precedence and need to be disabled to make this work)
* `backspace` deletes a character and resumes hinting autosuggestions
* `ctrl-left` accepts suggestion and moves cursor left one character.
* `backspace` deletes a character and resumes hinting autosuggestions
* `down` moves to suggestion to later in history when no lines are present below the cursors.
* `up` moves to suggestion from earlier in history when no lines are present above the cursor.

This is best described by the Gif posted by [@krassowski](https://github.com/krassowski), and in the PR itself [PR #13888](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13888/).

![../_images/autosuggest.gif](../_images/autosuggest.gif)

Please report any feedback in order for us to improve the user experience.
In particular we are also working on making the shortcuts configurable.

If you are interested in better terminal shortcuts, I also invite you to
participate in issue [13879](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/13879).

As we follow [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html), next version of
IPython will officially stop supporting numpy 1.20, and will stop supporting
Python 3.8 after April release.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.9 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/111?closed=1).

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.8.0[](#ipython-8-8-0 "Link to this heading")

First release of IPython in 2023 as there was no release at the end of
December.

This is an unusually big release (relatively speaking) with more than 15 Pull
Requests merged.

Of particular interest are:

> * [PR #13852](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13852/) that replaces the greedy completer and improves
>   completion, in particular for dictionary keys.
> * [PR #13858](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13858/) that adds `py.typed` to `setup.cfg` to make sure it is
>   bundled in wheels.
> * [PR #13869](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13869/) that implements tab completions for IPython options in the
>   shell when using `argcomplete <https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete>`. I
>   believe this also needs a recent version of Traitlets.
> * [PR #13865](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13865/) makes the `inspector` class of `InteractiveShell`
>   configurable.
> * [PR #13880](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13880/) that removes minor-version entrypoints as the minor version
>   entry points that would be included in the wheel would be the one of the
>   Python version that was used to build the `whl` file.

In no particular order, the rest of the changes update the test suite to be
compatible with Pygments 2.14, various docfixes, testing on more recent python
versions and various updates.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.8 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/110).

Many thanks to @krassowski for the many PRs and @jasongrout for reviewing and

## IPython 8.7.0[](#ipython-8-7-0 "Link to this heading")

Small release of IPython with a couple of bug fixes and new features for this
month. Next month is the end of year, it is unclear if there will be a release
close to the new year’s eve, or if the next release will be at the end of January.

Here are a few of the relevant fixes,
as usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.7 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?q=milestone%3A8.7).

> * [PR #13834](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13834/) bump the minimum prompt toolkit to 3.0.11.
> * IPython shipped with the `py.typed` marker now, and we are progressively
>   adding more types. [PR #13831](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13831/)
> * [PR #13817](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13817/) add configuration of code blacks formatting.

work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.6.0[](#ipython-8-6-0 "Link to this heading")

Back to a more regular release schedule (at least I try), as Friday is
already over by more than 24h hours. This is a slightly bigger release with a
few new features that contain no less than 25 PRs.

We’ll notably found a couple of non negligible changes:

The `install_ext` and related functions have been removed after being
deprecated for years. You can use pip to install extensions. `pip` did not
exist when `install_ext` was introduced. You can still load local extensions
without installing them. Just set your `sys.path` for example. [PR #13744](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13744/)

IPython now has extra entry points that use the major *and minor* version of
python. For some of you this means that you can do a quick `ipython3.10` to
launch IPython from the Python 3.10 interpreter, while still using Python 3.11
as your main Python. [PR #13743](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13743/)

The completer matcher API has been improved. See [PR #13745](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13745/). This should
improve the type inference and improve dict keys completions in many use case.
Thanks `@krassowski` for all the work, and the D.E. Shaw group for sponsoring
it.

The color of error nodes in tracebacks can now be customized. See
[PR #13756](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13756/). This is a private attribute until someone finds the time to
properly add a configuration option. Note that with Python 3.11 that also shows
the relevant nodes in traceback, it would be good to leverage this information
(plus the “did you mean” info added on attribute errors). But that’s likely work
I won’t have time to do before long, so contributions welcome.

As we follow NEP 29, we removed support for numpy 1.19 [PR #13760](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13760/).

The `open()` function present in the user namespace by default will now refuse
to open the file descriptors 0,1,2 (stdin, out, err), to avoid crashing IPython.
This mostly occurs in teaching context when incorrect values get passed around.

The `?`, `??`, and corresponding `pinfo`, `pinfo2` magics can now find
objects inside arrays. That is to say, the following now works:

```
>>> def my_func(*arg, **kwargs):pass
>>> container = [my_func]
>>> container[0]?

```

If `container` define a custom `getitem`, this \_\_will\_\_ trigger the custom
method. So don’t put side effects in your `getitems`. Thanks to the D.E. Shaw
group for the request and sponsoring the work.

## IPython 8.5.0[](#ipython-8-5-0 "Link to this heading")

First release since a couple of month due to various reasons and timing preventing
me for sticking to the usual monthly release the last Friday of each month. This
is of non negligible size as it has more than two dozen PRs with various fixes
an bug fixes.

Many thanks to everybody who contributed PRs for your patience in review and
merges.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of changes that have been implemented for IPython
8.5.0. As usual you can find the full list of issues and PRs tagged with [the
8.5 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A8.5+).

> * Added a shortcut for accepting auto suggestion. The End key shortcut for
>   accepting auto-suggestion This binding works in Vi mode too, provided
>   `TerminalInteractiveShell.emacs_bindings_in_vi_insert_mode` is set to be
>   `True` [PR #13566](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13566/).
> * No popup in window for latex generation when generating latex (e.g. via
>   `_latex_repr_`) no popup window is shows under Windows. [PR #13679](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13679/)
> * Fixed error raised when attempting to tab-complete an input string with
>   consecutive periods or forward slashes (such as “<file:///var/log/>…”).
>   [PR #13675](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13675/)
> * Relative filenames in Latex rendering :
>   The `latex_to_png_dvipng` command internally generates input and output file
>   arguments to `latex` and `dvipis`. These arguments are now generated as
>   relative files to the current working directory instead of absolute file
>   paths. This solves a problem where the current working directory contains
>   characters that are not handled properly by `latex` and `dvips`. There are
>   no changes to the user API. [PR #13680](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13680/)
> * Stripping decorators bug: Fixed bug which meant that ipython code blocks in
>   restructured text documents executed with the ipython-sphinx extension
>   skipped any lines of code containing python decorators. [PR #13612](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13612/)
> * Allow some modules with frozen dataclasses to be reloaded. [PR #13732](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13732/)
> * Fix paste magic on wayland. [PR #13671](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13671/)
> * show maxlen in deque’s repr. [PR #13648](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13648/)

### Restore line numbers for Input[](#restore-line-numbers-for-input "Link to this heading")

Line number information in tracebacks from input are restored.
Line numbers from input were removed during the transition to v8 enhanced traceback reporting.

So, instead of:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
Input In [3], in <cell line: 1>()
----> 1 myfunc(2)

Input In [2], in myfunc(z)
      1 def myfunc(z):
----> 2     foo.boo(z-1)

File ~/code/python/ipython/foo.py:3, in boo(x)
      2 def boo(x):
----> 3     return 1/(1-x)

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

```

The error traceback now looks like:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In [3], line 1
----> 1 myfunc(2)

Cell In [2], line 2, in myfunc(z)
      1 def myfunc(z):
----> 2     foo.boo(z-1)

File ~/code/python/ipython/foo.py:3, in boo(x)
      2 def boo(x):
----> 3     return 1/(1-x)

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

```

or, with xmode=Plain:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  Cell In [12], line 1
    myfunc(2)
  Cell In [6], line 2 in myfunc
    foo.boo(z-1)
  File ~/code/python/ipython/foo.py:3 in boo
    return 1/(1-x)
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

```

[PR #13560](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13560/)

### New setting to silence warning if working inside a virtual environment[](#new-setting-to-silence-warning-if-working-inside-a-virtual-environment "Link to this heading")

Previously, when starting IPython in a virtual environment without IPython installed (so IPython from the global environment is used), the following warning was printed:

> Attempting to work in a virtualenv. If you encounter problems, please install IPython inside the virtualenv.

This warning can be permanently silenced by setting `c.InteractiveShell.warn_venv` to `False` (the default is `True`).

[PR #13706](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13706/)

## IPython 8.4.0[](#ipython-8-4-0 "Link to this heading")

As for 7.34, this version contains a single fix: fix uncaught BdbQuit exceptions on ipdb
exit [PR #13668](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13668/), and a single typo fix in documentation: [PR #13682](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13682/)

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.3.0[](#ipython-8-3-0 "Link to this heading")

> * [PR #13625](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13625/), using `?`, `??`, `*?` will not call
>   `set_next_input` as most frontend allow proper multiline editing and it was
>   causing issues for many users of multi-cell frontends. This has been backported to 7.33
> * [PR #13600](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13600/), `pre_run_*`-hooks will now have a `cell_id` attribute on
>   the info object when frontend provides it. This has been backported to 7.33
> * [PR #13624](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13624/), fixed `End` key being broken after accepting an
>   auto-suggestion.
> * [PR #13657](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13657/) fixed an issue where history from different sessions would be mixed.

## IPython 8.2.0[](#ipython-8-2-0 "Link to this heading")

IPython 8.2 mostly bring bugfixes to IPython.

> * Auto-suggestion can now be elected with the `end` key. [PR #13566](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13566/)
> * Some traceback issues with `assert etb is not None` have been fixed. [PR #13588](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13588/)
> * History is now pulled from the sqitel database and not from in-memory.
>   In particular when using the `%paste` magic, the content of the pasted text will
>   be part of the history and not the verbatim text `%paste` anymore. [PR #13592](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13592/)
> * Fix `Ctrl-\\` exit cleanup [PR #13603](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13603/)
> * Fixes to `ultratb` ipdb support when used outside of IPython. [PR #13498](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13498/)

I am still trying to fix and investigate [#13598](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/13598/), which seems to be
random, and would appreciate help if you find a reproducible minimal case. I’ve
tried to make various changes to the codebase to mitigate it, but a proper fix
will be difficult without understanding the cause.

All the issues on pull-requests for this release can be found in the [8.2
milestone.](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/100) . And some
documentation only PR can be found as part of the [7.33 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/101) (currently not released).

## IPython 8.1.1[](#ipython-8-1-1 "Link to this heading")

Fix an issue with virtualenv and Python 3.8 introduced in 8.1

Revert [PR #13537](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13537/) (fix an issue with symlinks in virtualenv) that raises an
error in Python 3.8, and fixed in a different way in [PR #13559](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13559/).

## IPython 8.1.0[](#ipython-8-1-0 "Link to this heading")

IPython 8.1 is the first minor release after 8.0 and fixes a number of bugs and
updates a few behaviors that were problematic with the 8.0 as with many new major
release.

Note that beyond the changes listed here, IPython 8.1.0 also contains all the
features listed in [IPython 7.32](version7.html#version-7-32).

> * Misc and multiple fixes around quotation auto-closing. It is now disabled by
>   default. Run with `TerminalInteractiveShell.auto_match=True` to re-enabled

We want to remind users that IPython is part of the Jupyter organisations, and
thus governed by a Code of Conduct. Some of the behavior we have seen on GitHub is not acceptable.
Abuse and non-respectful comments on discussion will not be tolerated.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release, many of the above fixed issues and
new features were done by first time contributors, showing there is still
plenty of easy contribution possible in IPython
. You can find all individual contributions
to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/91).

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring
work on IPython and related libraries. In particular the Lazy autoloading of
magics that you will find described in the 7.32 release notes.

## IPython 8.0.1 (CVE-2022-21699)[](#ipython-8-0-1-cve-2022-21699 "Link to this heading")

IPython 8.0.1, 7.31.1 and 5.11 are security releases that change some default
values in order to prevent potential Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.

Almost all version of IPython looks for configuration and profiles in current
working directory. Since IPython was developed before pip and environments
existed it was used a convenient way to load code/packages in a project
dependent way.

In 2022, it is not necessary anymore, and can lead to confusing behavior where
for example cloning a repository and starting IPython or loading a notebook from
any Jupyter-Compatible interface that has ipython set as a kernel can lead to
code execution.

I did not find any standard way for packaged to advertise CVEs they fix, I’m
thus trying to add a `__patched_cves__` attribute to the IPython module that
list the CVEs that should have been fixed. This attribute is informational only
as if a executable has a flaw, this value can always be changed by an attacker.

```
In [1]: import IPython

In [2]: IPython.__patched_cves__
Out[2]: {'CVE-2022-21699'}

In [3]: 'CVE-2022-21699' in IPython.__patched_cves__
Out[3]: True

```

Thus starting with this version:

> * The current working directory is not searched anymore for profiles or
>   configurations files.
> * Added a `__patched_cves__` attribute (set of strings) to IPython module that contain
>   the list of fixed CVE. This is informational only.

Further details can be read on the [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/security/advisories/GHSA-pq7m-3gw7-gq5x)

## IPython 8.0[](#ipython-8-0 "Link to this heading")

IPython 8.0 is bringing a large number of new features and improvements to both the
user of the terminal and of the kernel via Jupyter. The removal of compatibility
with an older version of Python is also the opportunity to do a couple of
performance improvements in particular with respect to startup time.
The 8.x branch started diverging from its predecessor around IPython 7.12
(January 2020).

This release contains 250+ pull requests, in addition to many of the features
and backports that have made it to the 7.x branch. Please see the
[8.0 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/73?closed=1) for the full list of pull requests.

Please feel free to send pull requests to update those notes after release,
I have likely forgotten a few things reviewing 250+ PRs.

### Dependencies changes/downstream packaging[](#dependencies-changes-downstream-packaging "Link to this heading")

Most of our building steps have been changed to be (mostly) declarative
and follow PEP 517. We are trying to completely remove `setup.py` ([PR #13238](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13238/)) and are
looking for help to do so.

> * minimum supported `traitlets` version is now 5+
> * we now require `stack_data`
> * minimal Python is now 3.8
> * `nose` is not a testing requirement anymore
> * `pytest` replaces nose.
> * `iptest`/`iptest3` cli entrypoints do not exist anymore.
> * the minimum officially ​supported `numpy` version has been bumped, but this should
>   not have much effect on packaging.

### Deprecation and removal[](#deprecation-and-removal "Link to this heading")

We removed almost all features, arguments, functions, and modules that were
marked as deprecated between IPython 1.0 and 5.0. As a reminder, 5.0 was released
in 2016, and 1.0 in 2013. Last release of the 5 branch was 5.10.0, in May 2020.
The few remaining deprecated features we left have better deprecation warnings
or have been turned into explicit errors for better error messages.

I will use this occasion to add the following requests to anyone emitting a
deprecation warning:

> * Please add at least `stacklevel=2` so that the warning is emitted into the
>   caller context, and not the callee one.
> * Please add **since which version** something is deprecated.

As a side note, it is much easier to conditionally compare version
numbers rather than using `try/except` when functionality changes with a version.

I won’t list all the removed features here, but modules like `IPython.kernel`,
which was just a shim module around `ipykernel` for the past 8 years, have been
removed, and so many other similar things that pre-date the name **Jupyter**
itself.

We no longer need to add `IPython.extensions` to the PYTHONPATH because that is being
handled by `load_extension`.

We are also removing `Cythonmagic`, `sympyprinting` and `rmagic` as they are now in
other packages and no longer need to be inside IPython.

### Documentation[](#documentation "Link to this heading")

The majority of our docstrings have now been reformatted and automatically fixed by
the experimental [Vélin](https://pypi.org/project/velin/) project to conform
to numpydoc.

### Type annotations[](#type-annotations "Link to this heading")

While IPython itself is highly dynamic and can’t be completely typed, many of
the functions now have type annotations, and part of the codebase is now checked
by mypy.

### Featured changes[](#featured-changes "Link to this heading")

Here is a features list of changes in IPython 8.0. This is of course non-exhaustive.
Please note as well that many features have been added in the 7.x branch as well
(and hence why you want to read the 7.x what’s new notes), in particular
features contributed by QuantStack (with respect to debugger protocol and Xeus
Python), as well as many debugger features that I was pleased to implement as
part of my work at QuanSight and sponsored by DE Shaw.

#### Traceback improvements[](#traceback-improvements "Link to this heading")

Previously, error tracebacks for errors happening in code cells were showing a
hash, the one used for compiling the Python AST:

```
In [1]: def foo():
...:     return 3 / 0
...:

In [2]: foo()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-c19b6d9633cf> in <module>
----> 1 foo()

<ipython-input-1-1595a74c32d5> in foo()
    1 def foo():
----> 2     return 3 / 0
    3

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

```

The error traceback is now correctly formatted, showing the cell number in which the error happened:

```
In [1]: def foo():
...:     return 3 / 0
...:

Input In [2]: foo()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
input In [2], in <module>
----> 1 foo()

Input In [1], in foo()
    1 def foo():
----> 2     return 3 / 0

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

```

The `stack_data` package has been integrated, which provides smarter information in the traceback;
in particular it will highlight the AST node where an error occurs which can help to quickly narrow down errors.

For example in the following snippet:

```
def foo(i):
    x = [[[0]]]
    return x[0][i][0]

def bar():
    return foo(0) + foo(
        1
    ) + foo(2)

```

calling `bar()` would raise an `IndexError` on the return line of `foo`,
and IPython 8.0 is capable of telling you where the index error occurs:

```
IndexError
Input In [2], in <module>
----> 1 bar()
        ^^^^^

Input In [1], in bar()
      6 def bar():
----> 7     return foo(0) + foo(
                            ^^^^
      8         1
         ^^^^^^^^
      9     ) + foo(2)
         ^^^^

Input In [1], in foo(i)
      1 def foo(i):
      2     x = [[[0]]]
----> 3     return x[0][i][0]
                   ^^^^^^^

```

The corresponding locations marked here with `^` will show up highlighted in
the terminal and notebooks.

Finally, a colon `::` and line number is appended after a filename in
traceback:

```
ZeroDivisionError               Traceback (most recent call last)
File ~/error.py:4, in <module>
      1 def f():
      2     1/0
----> 4 f()

File ~/error.py:2, in f()
      1 def f():
----> 2     1/0

```

Many terminals and editors have integrations enabling you to directly jump to the
relevant file/line when this syntax is used, so this small addition may have a high
impact on productivity.

#### Autosuggestions[](#autosuggestions "Link to this heading")

Autosuggestion is a very useful feature available in [fish](https://fishshell.com/), [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), and [prompt-toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/pages/asking_for_input.html#auto-suggestion).

[Ptpython](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython#ptpython) allows users to enable this feature in
[ptpython/config.py](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython/blob/master/examples/ptpython_config/config.py#L90).

This feature allows users to accept autosuggestions with ctrl e, ctrl f,
or right arrow as described below.

1. Start ipython

![../_images/auto_suggest_1_prompt_no_text.png](../_images/auto_suggest_1_prompt_no_text.png)

2. Run `print("hello")`

![../_images/auto_suggest_2_print_hello_suggest.png](../_images/auto_suggest_2_print_hello_suggest.png)

3. start typing `print` again to see the autosuggestion

![../_images/auto_suggest_3_print_hello_suggest.png](../_images/auto_suggest_3_print_hello_suggest.png)

4. Press `ctrl-f`, or `ctrl-e`, or `right-arrow` to accept the suggestion

![../_images/auto_suggest_4_print_hello.png](../_images/auto_suggest_4_print_hello.png)

You can also complete word by word:

1. Run `def say_hello(): print("hello")`

![../_images/auto_suggest_second_prompt.png](../_images/auto_suggest_second_prompt.png)

2. Start typing the first letter if `def` to see the autosuggestion

![../_images/auto_suggest_d_phantom.png](../_images/auto_suggest_d_phantom.png)

3. Press `alt-f` (or `escape` followed by `f`), to accept the first word of the suggestion

![../_images/auto_suggest_def_phantom.png](../_images/auto_suggest_def_phantom.png)

Importantly, this feature does not interfere with tab completion:

1. After running `def say_hello(): print("hello")`, press d

![../_images/auto_suggest_d_phantom.png](../_images/auto_suggest_d_phantom.png)

2. Press Tab to start tab completion

![../_images/auto_suggest_d_completions.png](../_images/auto_suggest_d_completions.png)

3A. Press Tab again to select the first option

![../_images/auto_suggest_def_completions.png](../_images/auto_suggest_def_completions.png)

3B. Press `alt f` (`escape`, `f`) to accept to accept the first word of the suggestion

![../_images/auto_suggest_def_phantom.png](../_images/auto_suggest_def_phantom.png)

3C. Press `ctrl-f` or `ctrl-e` to accept the entire suggestion

![../_images/auto_suggest_match_parens.png](../_images/auto_suggest_match_parens.png)

Currently, autosuggestions are only shown in the emacs or vi insert editing modes:

* The ctrl e, ctrl f, and alt f shortcuts work by default in emacs mode.
* To use these shortcuts in vi insert mode, you will have to create [custom keybindings in your config.py](https://github.com/mskar/setup/commit/2892fcee46f9f80ef7788f0749edc99daccc52f4/).

#### Show pinfo information in ipdb using “?” and “??”[](#show-pinfo-information-in-ipdb-using-and "Link to this heading")

In IPDB, it is now possible to show the information about an object using “?”
and “??”, in much the same way that it can be done when using the IPython prompt:

```
ipdb> partial?
Init signature: partial(self, /, *args, **kwargs)
Docstring:
partial(func, *args, **keywords) - new function with partial application
of the given arguments and keywords.
File:           ~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.6/lib/python3.8/functools.py
Type:           type
Subclasses:

```

Previously, `pinfo` or `pinfo2` command had to be used for this purpose.

#### Autoreload 3 feature[](#autoreload-3-feature "Link to this heading")

Example: When an IPython session is run with the ‘autoreload’ extension loaded,
you will now have the option ‘3’ to select, which means the following:

> 1. replicate all functionality from option 2
> 2. autoload all new funcs/classes/enums/globals from the module when they are added
> 3. autoload all newly imported funcs/classes/enums/globals from external modules

Try `%autoreload 3` in an IPython session after running `%load_ext autoreload`.

For more information please see the following unit test : `extensions/tests/test_autoreload.py:test_autoload_newly_added_objects`

#### Auto formatting with black in the CLI[](#auto-formatting-with-black-in-the-cli "Link to this heading")

This feature was present in 7.x, but disabled by default.

In 8.0, input was automatically reformatted with Black when black was installed.
This feature has been reverted for the time being.
You can re-enable it by setting `TerminalInteractiveShell.autoformatter` to `"black"`

#### History Range Glob feature[](#history-range-glob-feature "Link to this heading")

Previously, when using `%history`, users could specify either
a range of sessions and lines, for example:

```
~8/1-~6/5   # see history from the first line of 8 sessions ago,
            # to the fifth line of 6 sessions ago.``

```

Or users could specify a glob pattern:

```
-g <pattern>  # glob ALL history for the specified pattern.

```

However users could *not* specify both.

If a user *did* specify both a range and a glob pattern,
then the glob pattern would be used (globbing *all* history) *and the range would be ignored*.

With this enhancement, if a user specifies both a range and a glob pattern, then the glob pattern will be applied to the specified range of history.

#### Don’t start a multi-line cell with sunken parenthesis[](#don-t-start-a-multi-line-cell-with-sunken-parenthesis "Link to this heading")

From now on, IPython will not ask for the next line of input when given a single
line with more closing than opening brackets. For example, this means that if
you (mis)type `]]` instead of `[]`, a `SyntaxError` will show up, instead of
the `...:` prompt continuation.

#### IPython shell for ipdb interact[](#ipython-shell-for-ipdb-interact "Link to this heading")

The ipdb `interact` starts an IPython shell instead of Python’s built-in `code.interact()`.

#### Automatic Vi prompt stripping[](#automatic-vi-prompt-stripping "Link to this heading")

When pasting code into IPython, it will strip the leading prompt characters if
there are any. For example, you can paste the following code into the console -
it will still work, even though each line is prefixed with prompts (`In`,
`Out`):

```
In [1]: 2 * 2 == 4
Out[1]: True

In [2]: print("This still works as pasted")

```

Previously, this was not the case for the Vi-mode prompts:

```
In [1]: [ins] In [13]: 2 * 2 == 4
   ...: Out[13]: True
   ...:
  File "<ipython-input-1-727bb88eaf33>", line 1
    [ins] In [13]: 2 * 2 == 4
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

This is now fixed, and Vi prompt prefixes - `[ins]` and `[nav]` - are
skipped just as the normal `In` would be.

IPython shell can be started in the Vi mode using `ipython --TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode=vi`,
You should be able to change mode dynamically with `%config TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode='vi'`

#### Empty History Ranges[](#empty-history-ranges "Link to this heading")

A number of magics that take history ranges can now be used with an empty
range. These magics are:

> * `%save`
> * `%load`
> * `%pastebin`
> * `%pycat`

Using them this way will make them take the history of the current session up
to the point of the magic call (such that the magic itself will not be
included).

Therefore it is now possible to save the whole history to a file using
`%save <filename>`, load and edit it using `%load` (makes for a nice usage
when followed with `F2`), send it to [dpaste.org](http://dpast.org) using
`%pastebin`, or view the whole thing syntax-highlighted with a single
`%pycat`.

#### Windows timing implementation: Switch to process\_time[](#windows-timing-implementation-switch-to-process-time "Link to this heading")

Timing on Windows, for example with `%%time`, was changed from being based on `time.perf_counter`
(which counted time even when the process was sleeping) to being based on `time.process_time` instead
(which only counts CPU time). This brings it closer to the behavior on Linux. See [PR #12984](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12984/).

#### Miscellaneous[](#id17 "Link to this heading")

> * Non-text formatters are not disabled in the terminal, which should simplify
>   writing extensions displaying images or other mimetypes in supporting terminals.
>   [PR #12315](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12315/)
> * It is now possible to automatically insert matching brackets in Terminal IPython using the
>   `TerminalInteractiveShell.auto_match=True` option. [PR #12586](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12586/)
> * We are thinking of deprecating the current `%%javascript` magic in favor of a better replacement. See [PR #13376](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13376/).
> * `~` is now expanded when part of a path in most magics [PR #13385](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13385/)
> * `%/%%timeit` magic now adds a comma every thousands to make reading a long number easier [PR #13379](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13379/)
> * `"info"` messages can now be customised to hide some fields [PR #13343](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13343/)

>   annoying to retype commands [PR #13246](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13246/)
> * `!pip` `!conda` `!cd` or `!ls` are likely doing the wrong thing. We

> * Make `%precision` work for `numpy.float64` type [PR #12902](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12902/)

#### Re-added support for XDG config directories[](#re-added-support-for-xdg-config-directories "Link to this heading")

XDG support through the years comes and goes. There is a tension between having
an identical location for configuration in all platforms versus having simple instructions.
After initial failures a couple of years ago, IPython was modified to automatically migrate XDG
config files back into `~/.ipython`. That migration code has now been removed.
IPython now checks the XDG locations, so if you \_manually\_ move your config
files to your preferred location, IPython will not move them back.

### Preparing for Python 3.10[](#preparing-for-python-3-10 "Link to this heading")

To prepare for Python 3.10, we have started working on removing reliance and
any dependency that is not compatible with Python 3.10. This includes migrating our
test suite to pytest and starting to remove nose. This also means that the
`iptest` command is now gone and all testing is via pytest.

This was in large part thanks to the NumFOCUS Small Developer grant, which enabled us to
allocate $4000 to hire [Nikita Kniazev (@Kojoley)](https://github.com/Kojoley),
who did a fantastic job at updating our code base, migrating to pytest, pushing
our coverage, and fixing a large number of bugs. I highly recommend contacting
them if you need help with C++ and Python projects.

You can find all relevant issues and PRs with [the SDG 2021 tag](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues?q=label%3A%22Numfocus+SDG+2021%22+)

### Removing support for older Python versions[](#removing-support-for-older-python-versions "Link to this heading")

We are removing support for Python up through 3.7, allowing internal code to use the more
efficient `pathlib` and to make better use of type annotations.

!["Meme image of Toy Story with Woody and Buzz, with the text 'pathlib, pathlib everywhere'"](../_images/pathlib_pathlib_everywhere.jpg)

We had about 34 PRs only to update some logic to update some functions from managing strings to
using Pathlib.

The completer has also seen significant updates and now makes use of newer Jedi APIs,
offering faster and more reliable tab completion.

### Misc Statistics[](#misc-statistics "Link to this heading")

Here are some numbers:

```
7.x: 296 files, 12561 blank lines, 20282 comments, 35142 line of code.
8.0: 252 files, 12053 blank lines, 19232 comments, 34505 line of code.
