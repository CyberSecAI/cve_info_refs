Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21687:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper input validation of the `-database` parameter in `gh-ost`. The application fails to sanitize or validate the input, allowing users to inject arbitrary DSN (Data Source Name) strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The application doesn't properly sanitize the `-database` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary DSN strings.
- Code Injection: Specifically, DSN injection allows for control over the database connection parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Local File Read: By injecting a malicious DSN string, an attacker can force `gh-ost` to connect to a malicious MySQL server controlled by the attacker. This malicious server can then potentially return data as if it was a legitimate MySQL database. With the ability to control server responses, an attacker may be able to get the application to expose local files that the user running `gh-ost` has access to.

**Attack vectors:**
- Command-line argument manipulation: An attacker can inject malicious DSN strings via the `-database` command-line parameter of `gh-ost`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the target host: The attacker needs to have access to the host where `gh-ost` is running or trick an administrator into running a malicious `gh-ost` command on such a host.
- Network access: The attacker needs network access from the host running `gh-ost` to a malicious MySQL server they control.
