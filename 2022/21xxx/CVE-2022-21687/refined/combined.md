# Improper Input Validation of `-database` Parameter

Low

[dm-2](/dm-2)
published
GHSA-rrp4-2xx3-mv29
Jan 31, 2022

## Package

gomod

gh-ost
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 1.1.2

## Patched versions

1.1.3

## Description

Gh-ost version <= 1.1.2 allows users to inject DSN strings via the `-database` parameter.

This is a low severity vulnerability as the attacker must have access to the target host or trick an administrator into executing a malicious `gh-ost` command on a host running `gh-ost`, plus network access from host running `gh-ost` to the attack's malicious MySQL server.

### Impact

This issue may lead to arbitrary local file read.

### Patches

Fixed in 1.1.3+.

### Workarounds

None

### References

* <https://advisory.dw1.io/51>

### For more information

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-21687

### Weaknesses

[CWE-20](/advisories?query=cwe%3A20) [CWE-99](/advisories?query=cwe%3A99) [CWE-141](/advisories?query=cwe%3A141)
