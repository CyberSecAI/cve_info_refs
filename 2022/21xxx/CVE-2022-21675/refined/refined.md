  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application was vulnerable to a Zip Slip vulnerability, where a specially crafted archive with directory traversal filenames could write files outside of the intended extraction directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction",
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could overwrite existing files on the filesystem. In a web application context, this could allow for the placement of a web shell to achieve remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted archive with directory traversal filenames",
      "File overwrite"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide an archive with malicious filenames to the application.",
    "fixes": [
      "The application now checks if the canonical path of the extracted file starts with the destination directory before writing the file, preventing the exploit.",
       "Ensuring the destination directory path ends with a file separator"
