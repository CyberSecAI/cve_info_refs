- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Atvise software transmits login credentials via plaintext HTTP POST request during the registration process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). Specifically, login credentials for the atvise.com website are sent unencrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who successfully performs a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can capture the plaintext credentials. The attacker can then use these credentials to log in to the Atvise website, download software and licenses. The vulnerability doesn't affect the machine running the client component.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker needs to be positioned between the client application and the atvise.com server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between the Atvise client and the atvise.com server.
