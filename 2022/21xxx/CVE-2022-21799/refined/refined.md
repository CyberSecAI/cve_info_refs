Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-21799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a Cross-site scripting (XSS) weakness.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]:** The ELECOM LAN router firmware is vulnerable to XSS attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary scripts in a user's browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute an arbitrary script on a logged-in user's web browser. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions depending on the context and the scope of the script executed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected device to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R), where the victim user would need to perform an action such as clicking a manipulated link, to trigger the execution of the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be network-adjacent, i.e., on the same LAN as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges (PR:N) on the device itself.
- The attacker needs to trick a user to interact with the malicious payload to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Affected Product:**
- WRC-300FEBK-R firmware v1.13 and earlier

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by RyotaK.
- The vendor, ELECOM CO., LTD., has released firmware updates to address the vulnerability, and users are advised to apply the updates as soon as possible.
