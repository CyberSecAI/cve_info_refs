- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ReceiveVarData<T>` function in `SocketClient.cs` uses `BinaryFormatter` without proper restrictions or type bindings. This allows an attacker to send arbitrary data, which is then deserialized, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted deserialization using `BinaryFormatter`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the server side.
- **Attack vectors:** Network, as the socket client is bound to the network stack. An attacker can send a malicious payload over the network to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service and have knowledge of how to craft a malicious payload for `BinaryFormatter`. Low privileges are required.
