- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the Admin Interface of NVIDIA FLARE, where an unauthorized attacker can trigger resource allocation without any limits or throttling mechanisms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper resource management within the Admin Interface, allowing for unlimited resource allocation. This maps to CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to system unavailability due to resource exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) to trigger the vulnerability. The attack complexity is low (AC:L), implying the ease of exploitation.
