Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21722:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient checks when processing incoming RTP/RTCP packets, potentially leading to out-of-bounds read access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing RTP/RTCP packets.
- The code does not properly validate the length of incoming packets against their declared size, which allows for read access beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service due to the crash.
- It may also lead to information disclosure by leaking data from the program's memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted RTP/RTCP packets to a vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to send malicious RTP/RTCP packets to the targeted system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to a system using the vulnerable library.
- The attacker needs to be within the network and able to send manipulated packets

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all users of PJMEDIA that accept incoming RTP/RTCP packets.
- The fix for the vulnerability is available in commit `22af44e` in the master branch of the pjproject repository.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.12 or later.
- Specific checks were added to the `rtcp.c`, `rtcp_fb.c` and `rtp.c` files to prevent out-of-bounds reads.
- The fix includes checks to ensure that the size of RTP/RTCP packets does not exceed the available data, preventing out of bound read access.
