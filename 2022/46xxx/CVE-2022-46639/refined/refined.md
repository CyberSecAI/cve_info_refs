- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `descarga_etiqueta.php` component of the Correos module uses the PHP function `readfile` without sanitizing the `path` and `filename` parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can read local files, including those outside the document root, potentially compromising credentials. Additionally, the vulnerability could be used to attack intranet hosts.
- **Attack vectors**:  The `path` and `filename` parameters in the `descarga_etiqueta.php` script are vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `descarga_etiqueta.php` script.
