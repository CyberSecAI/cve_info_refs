- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/hss/admin/?page=client/manage_client` endpoint, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can extract sensitive information such as database names and potentially gain further access to the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET request to the `/hss/admin/?page=client/manage_client` endpoint with a crafted `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and requires knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
