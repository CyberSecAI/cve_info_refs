- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**:  A CSRF attack can be carried out by crafting a malicious request that is triggered by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to execute the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
