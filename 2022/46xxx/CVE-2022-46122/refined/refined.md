Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `view_category.php` file of the Helmet Store Showroom Site v1.0. The application uses an unsanitized `id` parameter directly in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- **Database Manipulation:** The attacker can modify, add, or delete data from the database.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the database server and potentially the application server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint. Specifically, the attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** By inserting a malicious SQL payload within the id parameter, the attacker can directly manipulate the database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application server.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker requires knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter which is `id`.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is available at the `/hss/admin/categories/view_category.php` endpoint which does not require authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided payload `id=-5' union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6--+` demonstrates how to extract the database name, which confirms the presence of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable file is located at `/hss/admin/categories/view_category.php?id=`.
- The database name is `hss_db`.
- The version of the php used was 8.1.
