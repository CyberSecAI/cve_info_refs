Schneider Electric Security Notification

PowerLogic ION7400 / PM8000 / ION9000 Power Meters

9 May 2023 (13 June 2023)

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of the use of an unsecure protocol in its PowerLogic ION9000,
PowerLogic ION7400, PowerLogic PM8000, PowerLogic ION8650, PowerLogic ION8800 and
all legacy ION products.

The PowerLogic ION9000, PowerLogic ION7400, PowerLogic PM8000, PowerLogic ION8650
and PowerLogic ION8800 are energy and power quality meters.

The ION Protocol was created over 30 years ago to bring sophisticated data exchange to digital
power meters. As cybersecurity became a concern, the protocol was enhanced with support for
authentication. More recently, end-to-end encryption support for data in transit using industry
standard TLS was released after a multi-year effort to design a solution that would not break
backward compatibility with decades of products installed in the field.

This disclosure announces the new secure ION protocol feature for the PowerLogic ION9000,
ION7400 and PM8000 products. Secure ION enhances the security of the ION protocol by using
a Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypted tunnel between the device and other systems or
software.
June 2023 Update: Additional context has been added to the overview section.

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2022-46680

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 8.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-319: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists that could
cause disclosure of sensitive information, denial of service, or modification of data if an attacker
is able to intercept network traffic.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

Version

Mitigations

PowerLogic ION8650
PowerLogic ION8800
Legacy ION products

Customers should immediately apply the following mitigations to
reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Ensure devices that support ION protocol are not exposed to
the Internet or other untrusted networks.  Apply the best
practices for network hardening documented in product user
guide and the Schneider Electric Recommended
Cybersecurity Best Practices

•  To ensure you are informed of all updates, including details on

affected products and remediation plans, subscribe to

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.

Schneider Electric Security Notification

•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
