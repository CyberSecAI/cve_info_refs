**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need any existing account on the vulnerable application to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a victim user into loading a crafted page (e.g. a link in an email, or a page on a malicious website) to trigger the malicious request. The victim does not need to be an administrator on the target site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has been publicly disclosed.
- A Proof of Concept video is available, demonstrating how the attack is carried out.
- The vendor of the vulnerable software is "oretnom23".
