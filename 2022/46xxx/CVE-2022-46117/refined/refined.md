The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Helmet Store Showroom Site v1.0 by oretnom23.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `/hss/?page=view_product&id=` endpoint, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or gain further access to the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is located in the GET parameter `id` of the `/hss/?page=view_product` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the `id` GET parameter.

The content provides a specific payload example:
```
/hss/?page=view_product&id=-5%27%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,database(),6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13--+
```
This payload demonstrates how to extract the database name.
