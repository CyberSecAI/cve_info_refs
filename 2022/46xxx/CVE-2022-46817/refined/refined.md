- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Flyzoo Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into a website. These scripts would execute when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the plugin's input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrator privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
