- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Launchpad â€“ Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode Plugin, in versions 1.0.13 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions on the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could lead to unauthorized changes, modifications or other actions within the website, depending on the actions available to the targeted user and lacking CSRF protection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit a malicious page, or click a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, and needs to lure the authenticated user to trigger the attack.
