Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the password field of the administrator login form. Specifically, the application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without adequate escaping or parameterized queries.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability via a POST request. The application's failure to sanitize the password field allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the administrator login authentication and gain administrative access to the application. With administrative access, the attacker can steal sensitive information including hospital, doctor and patient data. They can also perform privileged operations such as managing doctors, potentially disrupting operations or causing further harm.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted POST request to `/Hospital-Management-System-master/func3.php`. The attack uses the username and password fields in the login form to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application and be able to send HTTP POST requests. They also need to be able to craft the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Technical details:**

*   **Affected product:** Hospital Management System
*   **Affected version:** v1.0
*   **Vulnerable URL:** `/Hospital-Management-System-master/index.php`
*   **Vulnerable location:** `/Hospital-Management-System-master/func3.php`
*   **Payload:** `username1=admin%40admin.com&password2=1%27+or+username%3D%27admin&adsub=Login`
*   **SQL Injection String:** The injected SQL string is `1' or username='admin`. This results in the following SQL query being executed: `select * from admintb where username='admin@admin.com' and password='1' or username='admin';`. The crafted SQL statement bypasses the password check and allows access if a username matches 'admin'

This detailed breakdown provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and the potential impact.
