- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A misconfiguration in the default Apache HTTP Server configuration of Polarion ALM. Specifically, the `RedirectMatch` directive is not properly configured to include the hostname, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious hostname.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Host header injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can spoof the Host header information and redirect users to malicious websites. This could lead to phishing attacks, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Polarion ALM server. No authentication is required. The user must click on a malicious link or otherwise be redirected to the attacker's server.
