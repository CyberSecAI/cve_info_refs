- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Print Invoice & Delivery Notes for WooCommerce Plugin <= 4.7.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications, data breaches or other malicious activities. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious link or page that, when accessed by a logged-in user of the vulnerable plugin, would trigger actions within the plugin without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application.
