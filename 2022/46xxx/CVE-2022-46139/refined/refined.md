- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of cryptographic protection during firmware delivery via the plain HTTP protocol. This allows an attacker to intercept and replace a legitimate firmware update with a malicious one.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of cryptographic protection (e.g., HTTPS) during firmware transfer.
    - Insufficient verification of the firmware image before installation. Although the firmware image has MD5 checksums, these can be recalculated by the attacker after modifying the firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the router unusable after the malicious firmware is installed.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack during the firmware upload process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker must have a privileged network position to intercept the firmware transfer, achievable through techniques like ARP spoofing or DNS spoofing.
    - Attacker needs to be able to modify the firmware image and recalculate the checksums within the firmware headers.
