- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how Apache CXF parses the `href` attribute of `XOP:Include` elements within MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) requests. Specifically, the parsing process is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the SSRF vulnerability which arises from improper handling of URLs within the `href` attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks against web services using a crafted MTOM request, potentially gaining unauthorized access to internal resources, scanning internal networks, or even escalating privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through specially crafted MTOM requests containing malicious `href` attributes within `XOP:Include` elements.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send MTOM requests to a vulnerable web service which takes at least one parameter of any type.
