- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of mutual authentication in the DHCP process of Wi-Fi-based commercial drones. The DHCP server assigns IP addresses based on MAC addresses without verifying their legitimacy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of mutual authentication in DHCP.
    - DHCP server's vulnerability to spoofed DHCP DISCOVER packets.
    - Inability of the DHCP server to distinguish between legitimate and manipulated connection requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting all available IP addresses on the drone's DHCP server.
    - Prevents legitimate devices from connecting to the drone's internal network.
    - Forcibly denies the drone owner access to drone services.
    - Disruption of drone operation.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based attack via Wi-Fi.
    - Exploitation of the DHCP protocol by sending manipulated DISCOVER packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the drone.
    - Initial access to the drone's Wi-Fi network is required, which may involve password cracking or other Wi-Fi penetration techniques.
    - The attacker needs the ability to craft and send DHCP DISCOVER packets with spoofed MAC addresses.
