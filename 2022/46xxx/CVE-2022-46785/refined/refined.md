Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue within SquaredUp DS for SCOM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The core weakness is the ability to manipulate the prototype of JavaScript objects. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The prototype pollution issue is exploited to achieve cross-site scripting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.
- This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions, potentially compromising user accounts and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not explicitly detailed in this document, but it involves manipulating the application such that the prototype pollution vulnerability is triggered. This likely involves injecting malicious payloads into data that is processed by the application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to interact with the vulnerable SquaredUp DS application and send a payload that triggers the prototype pollution. The document doesn't specify if this can be done remotely without any prior access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected versions of SquaredUp DS for SCOM, SquaredUp DS for Azure, and SquaredUp DS Standalone are all earlier than 5.7.1.9085.
- The vulnerability was reported by Kajetan Rostojek from ING Tech Poland.
- The fix is to upgrade to version 5.7.1.9085 or later.
