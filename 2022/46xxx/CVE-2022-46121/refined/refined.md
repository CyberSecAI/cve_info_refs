The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Helmet Store Showroom Site v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `/hss/admin/?page=products/manage_product&id=` URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly embeds user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. In this case, the attacker is able to retrieve the database name.
- Data Modification: Attackers might be able to modify or delete data from the database.
- Privilege Escalation: With sufficient access to the database, the attacker could potentially gain control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious GET request to the `/hss/admin/?page=products/manage_product&id=` URL, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL and parameter.
- No authentication is required as this exploit was achieved with admin account.
