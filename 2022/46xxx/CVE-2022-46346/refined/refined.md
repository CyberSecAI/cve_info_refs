Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-46346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write that occurs when parsing specially crafted X_B files. Specifically, the application writes data past the end of an allocated memory structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the parsing of malicious X_B files. An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious X_B file.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the malicious file with a vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or network access to trigger the vulnerability, as the file parsing occurs locally within the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Parasolid, a 3D geometric modeling tool.
- The vulnerability also affects Solid Edge.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-19071.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.8.
- The vulnerability is one of multiple file parsing vulnerabilities affecting these products.
