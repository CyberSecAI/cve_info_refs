```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the /goform/SetClientState endpoint. The user-controlled parameters ul_speed and dl_speed are concatenated using sprintf without any bounds checking, which allows an attacker to write past the buffer on the stack.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service by crashing the router. It also has the potential to achieve remote code execution if the attacker crafts an appropriate exploit to inject and execute shellcode.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted POST request to the /goform/SetClientState endpoint with an excessively long ul_speed and/or dl_speed parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. No authentication is required as long as a valid cookie is provided, which can be 'password=1111' as indicated in the PoC."
