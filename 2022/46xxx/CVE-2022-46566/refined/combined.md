# D-link DIR882-6
###### tags: `D-Link` `DIR-882`
vendor:D-link
product:DIR882
version:DIR882A1\_FW130B06.bin
type:Stack Overflow
author:Yifeng Li, Wolin Zhuang;
## Vulnerability Details
![](https://i.imgur.com/FJbQLrx.png)
In module SetQuickVPNSettings,the content obtained by the programe through /SetQuickVPNSettings/Password is passed to v4 which is controllable for attacker and latet passed into function decrypt\_aes as a parameter.
![](https://i.imgur.com/FGiGxGV.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/mbfm7Oh.png)
After that, it is passed into function sub\_426D74 as the first parameter as a2.Besides, we notice that local variable v6 is placed on the stack, which is also passed into function sub\_426D74 as the second parameter.
![](https://i.imgur.com/DDR99OK.png)
In function sub\_426D74, the for loop from line 26 to line 32, first copy a1 to v7 then strtol transfer v7 to a2, which briefly, a2 equals hexdecode(a1).Let's start over again, a1, comes from a2 in function decrypt\_aes, a variable is controllable to the attacker.And a2 comes from v6 in function decrypt\_aes which is placed on the stack, so when we copy a1 to a2 in sub\_426D74, we are basically putting v4's value into v6, which leads to a stack overflow vulnerbility .

## Recurring vulnerabilities and POC
In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:
1. Install firmware DIR882A1\_FW130B06.bin to router DIR882
2. Login to 192.168.0.1 as admin
3. Attack with the following POC
