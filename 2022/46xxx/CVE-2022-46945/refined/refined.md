Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46945:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `readHoverUrl` method of the `NagVisHoverUrl` class in NagVis. This method uses `file_get_contents` to retrieve content from a user-provided URL. The vulnerability arises because the code does not properly validate the URL scheme, allowing an attacker to supply a `file:///` URL and read arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files on the server due to the lack of URL scheme validation. The code does not restrict the allowed schemes and permits the use of `file:///` URLs.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Although mitigated by the patch, the original vulnerability allowed for SSRF as any URL could be requested.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read sensitive files accessible by the webserver user.
*   Specifically, the `automation.secret` file containing the plaintext secret for the Checkmk automation user can be read by an attacker who has already gained access to NagVis. This secret is used to authenticate with automation endpoints, thus leading to further attack vectors if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   By reading the automation secret and deleting it, an attacker could login to the Checkmk GUI using the automation user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `getHoverUrl` action within the `CoreModGeneral` class in NagVis. This endpoint is accessible to authenticated users.
*   The attacker provides a URL containing the `file:///` scheme.
*   This action is exploitable after an attacker has gained access to the NagVis component by exploiting other vulnerabilities to bypass authentication of the NagVis component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be authenticated to the NagVis component. This can be achieved by chaining prior vulnerabilities such as the ability to forge arbitrary LQL queries.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the `getHoverUrl` action.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was patched by restricting the accepted URL schemes to `http` and `https`, preventing the use of `file:///` URLs.
*   The vulnerability is related to a chain of vulnerabilities, which when combined allow for unauthenticated remote code execution.
*   The plaintext storage of sensitive data like the `automation.secret` significantly increases the impact of the file read vulnerability.
