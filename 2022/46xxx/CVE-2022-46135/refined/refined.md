The provided content is related to CVE-2022-46135.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of file type validation before uploading in the `edit_post.php` file. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary file upload:** The system does not properly validate the type of file being uploaded.
- **Lack of file type validation:** The absence of checks on file extensions or MIME types allows for the upload of executable files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file (webshell), the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the web server.
- **Full control of the web server:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker full control over the web server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/posts.php?source=edit_post` endpoint.
- **Multipart form data:** The malicious file is included in the request as part of a multipart form data payload with a filename of phpinfo.php.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the admin panel.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL `/admin/posts.php?source=edit_post` and the structure of the POST request.
