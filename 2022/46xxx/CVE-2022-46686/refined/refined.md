Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46686:

**CVE-2022-46686**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Custom Build Properties Plugin does not properly escape property values and build display names when rendering them on the Custom Build Properties and Build Summary pages.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the affected pages. When a user views these pages, the injected script will execute, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Other malicious actions
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the ability to set or change property values or build display names can inject malicious scripts.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to modify build properties or display names. This typically requires a certain level of access within Jenkins. The vulnerability is exploitable by users with the permission to configure builds or change build display names.

**Summary:**

The Custom Build Properties plugin had a stored XSS vulnerability due to improper escaping of user-controlled data. An attacker could inject malicious javascript code via build properties or build display names. This script would then execute when a user views the build properties or build summary pages.
