- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Cart All In One For WooCommerce plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions, under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the lack of CSRF protection to induce a logged-in user to perform actions they did not intend to. This is achieved by crafting malicious requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user of the vulnerable plugin to interact with a malicious request, but does not need to be authenticated themselves.
