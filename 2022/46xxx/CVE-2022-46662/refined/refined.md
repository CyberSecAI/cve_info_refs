Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46662:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Roxio Creator LJB software starting another program using an unquoted file path. This is a classic case of an "Unquoted Service Path" vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unquoted Service Path (CWE-428):** The core weakness is that the path to an executable used by Roxio Creator LJB is not enclosed in quotes. This allows Windows to potentially misinterpret the path and execute a malicious program.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** If a malicious executable is placed in a directory within the unquoted path, it could be executed by the service with the service's privileges. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system, as it allows arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs local access to the system. They need the ability to place a malicious executable in a path that is part of the unquoted service path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires high privileges to write to certain protected locations, where windows searches for executable when unquoted paths are used, thus it is specified as "High" in the CVSS vector.
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable at a specific location within the file path used by Roxio Creator LJB. This location is not specified.
