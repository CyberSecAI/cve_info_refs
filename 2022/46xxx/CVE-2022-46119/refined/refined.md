Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `categories` page of the Helmet Store Showroom Site v1.0. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `c` parameter in the URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of user input in the `c` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Information Leakage: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including database name, table structure, and other potentially sensitive data.
- Data Manipulation: With a successful SQL injection attack, an attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database, potentially compromising data integrity.
- Potential for further exploitation: Depending on database permissions and application configuration, SQL injection could lead to further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/hss/` endpoint, specifically targeting the `/hss/?page=categories` page and injecting malicious SQL code within the `c` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send the malicious HTTP GET requests.
- Basic SQL knowledge: The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to craft a working exploit.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable parameter is `c` at `/hss/?page=categories&c=`
- The reported payload is `/hss/?page=categories&c=-2%27%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4,5,6--+`
- The database name of the vulnerable application is `hss_db`
