```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of cryptographic protection and signature verification for the firmware update image during the firmware delivery process. The communication uses plain HTTP, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure communication protocol (HTTP)",
      "Lack of signature verification for firmware images",
      "Insufficient integrity checks on firmware updates, relying solely on MD5 checksums within the headers, which can be recalculated by an attacker after modification of the firmware image"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the firmware verification and install a malicious firmware image, leading to denial-of-service (DoS), malware or backdoor implantation. This can render the device unusable or compromise its security.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by intercepting the firmware update communication",
      "Network positioning via ARP or DNS spoofing",
      "Replacement of user-uploaded firmware with crafted malicious firmware image"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a privileged network position to intercept and manipulate the communication between the user and the router during the firmware update. Specifically, the attacker needs to be on the same network as the target router.",
    "additional_details": "The firmware image structure is [header, bootloader, header, kernel, rootfs]. Each header includes an MD5 checksum. The vulnerability was successfully demonstrated by modifying bytes in the kernel, recalculating the corresponding MD5 checksums, and injecting the modified firmware to the device."
