```
 - Root cause of vulnerability: The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation accepts a "PauseEncReqPlainText" message before the pairing process is complete.
 - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The device enters a faulty state, discarding further messages from the central device, resulting in a service issue.
 - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can disrupt the pairing and encryption procedures, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
 - Attack vectors: An attacker in radio range can send a specially crafted "PauseEncReqPlainText" message to a vulnerable Bluetooth Low Energy device before pairing is complete.
 - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be within the radio range of the vulnerable device and have the ability to send Bluetooth Low Energy messages.
