  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The drag-and-drop XBlock for Open edX was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) because it did not sanitize HTML input in multiple fields.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-80"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into XBlock fields. This code would then be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected content. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via network requests to the platform hosting the vulnerable XBlock, by providing malicious HTML as input to various fields",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have high privileges to edit content within the Open edX platform. Additionally, some user interaction is required because the XSS would be triggered when other users view the content."

      "Modified `drag_and_drop_v2/drag_and_drop_v2.py` to sanitize HTML in `displayName`, `question_text`, zone titles, and feedback messages using the `sanitize_html` utility function.",
