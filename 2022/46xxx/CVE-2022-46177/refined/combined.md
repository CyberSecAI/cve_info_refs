# Password reset link can lead to in account takeover if user changes to a new email

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)

GHSA-5www-jxvf-vrc3
Jan 5, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.8.13; beta <= 3.0.0.beta15; tests-passed <= 3.0.0.beta15

## Patched versions

stable > 2.8.13; beta >= 3.0.0.beta16; tests-passed >= 3.0.0.beta16

## Description

### Impact

When a user requests for a password reset link email, **then** changes their primary email, the old reset email is still valid. When the old reset email is used to reset the password, the Discourse account's primary email would be re-linked to the old email.

If the old email address is compromised or has transferred ownership, this leads to an account takeover. This is however mitigated by the SiteSetting `email_token_valid_hours` which is currently 48 hours.

### Patches

Upgrade to 3.0.0.beta15.

### Workarounds

Lower `email_token_valid_hours`  as needed.

### Severity

Moderate

5.7

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
