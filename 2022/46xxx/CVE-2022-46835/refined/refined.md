Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from a path traversal flaw in JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.2.20, as documented in CVE-2020-6950. This JSF vulnerability allows access to arbitrary files within the application server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate file paths and access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized File Access:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to read arbitrary files within the application server's filesystem. This could expose sensitive data, configuration files, or other critical information.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network-based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (AV:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:L).
* **No User Interaction:** The attack requires no user interaction (UI:N).
* **Complex Attack:** The attack has a high complexity (AC:H).
* **System Scope Unchanged:** The attack does not change the system scope (S:U).

**Affected Versions:**
* IdentityIQ 8.3 and all 8.3 patch levels prior to 8.3p2
* IdentityIQ 8.2 and all 8.2 patch levels prior to 8.2p5
* IdentityIQ 8.1 and all 8.1 patch levels prior to 8.1p7
* IdentityIQ 8.0 and all 8.0 patch levels prior to 8.0p6

**Resolution:**
* SailPoint has released an e-fix to address the vulnerability across all impacted versions of IdentityIQ. Future patch levels will also include this fix.

**CVSS Score:**
* 8.8 (High)
* CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
