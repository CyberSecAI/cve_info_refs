Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` module of the Tenda F1203 router firmware when processing requests to `/goform/RouteStatic`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered by the `entrys` parameter within the `fromRouteStatic` function. The code handling this parameter does not perform adequate bounds checking.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates that a successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS). The router becomes unresponsive after the overflow.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/RouteStatic` endpoint. The attacker sends a long string of 'a' characters via the `entrys` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, which typically requires network access to the device. They also need to know that the `/goform/RouteStatic` endpoint exists and that it uses the `entrys` parameter. The attacker also needs to know the valid Cookie (`user=admin`).
