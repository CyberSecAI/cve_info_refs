{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The router checks the firmware version based on the filename of the uploaded image instead of the contents of the file. Additionally, the firmware update process occurs over unencrypted HTTP.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure firmware update mechanism that relies on filename for version check.",
      "Lack of cryptographic protection for firmware updates over HTTP."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can downgrade the router's firmware to an older, potentially vulnerable version, by performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept firmware uploads.",
       "Exploitation of vulnerable firmware update process via HTTP."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker requires a privileged network position via ARP or DNS spoofing in order to intercept and modify HTTP requests. The attacker also needs to have access to older firmware versions."
