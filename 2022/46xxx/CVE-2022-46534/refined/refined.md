The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda F1203 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `speed_dir` parameter in the `formSetSpeedWan` function, specifically within the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in the `httpd` module.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) can be triggered by sending a crafted request with an oversized `speed_dir` parameter, causing the router to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint with an overly long `speed_dir` parameter in the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This usually means being on the same network as the device or having access to it through a port forwarding rule.
- The attacker must know that the device is vulnerable and the path `/goform/SetSpeedWan`
