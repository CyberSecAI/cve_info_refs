# Group SMTP user emails are exposed in CC email header

Low

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.8.13; beta <= 3.0.0.beta15; tests-passed <= 3.0.0.beta15

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.8.14; beta >= 3.0.0.beta16; tests-passed >= 3.0.0.beta16

## Description

### Impact

Recipients of a group SMTP email could see the email addresses of all other users inside the group SMTP topic. Most of the time this is not an issue as they are likely already familiar with one another's email addresses.

### Patches

Patched in latest version. The fix for this is that when we are sending emails out via group SMTP, if we are sending them to non-staged users we want to mask those emails with BCC, just so we don't expose them to anyone we shouldn't. Staged users are ones that have likely only interacted with the group via email, and will likely include other people who were CC'd on the original email to the group.

### Workarounds

Disable group SMTP for any groups that have it enabled.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @tgxworld **[tgxworld](/tgxworld)** commented [Jan 4, 2023](#issue-1519611378)

When sending emails out via group SMTP, if we

are sending them to non-staged users we want

to mask those emails with BCC, just so we don't

expose them to anyone we shouldn't. Staged users

are ones that have likely only interacted with

support via email, and will likely include other

people who were CC'd on the original email to the

group.

Sorry, something went wrong.
