# Squirrel: It's like ClickOnce but Works™

[![](/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/raw/develop/docs/artwork/Squirrel-Logo.png)](/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/develop/docs/artwork/Squirrel-Logo.png)

[![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/676f235e9d39c86a64cb7e571b062ed0e8f925f4541efde6895e21816cf3d75c/68747470733a2f2f6465762e617a7572652e636f6d2f737175697272656c2d696e7374616c6c6572732f537175697272656c2e57696e646f77732f5f617069732f6275696c642f7374617475732f537175697272656c2e537175697272656c2e57696e646f77733f6272616e63684e616d653d6d6173746572)](https://dev.azure.com/squirrel-installers/Squirrel.Windows/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Squirrel is both a set of tools and a library, to completely manage both installation and updating your Desktop Windows application, written in either C# or any other language (i.e., Squirrel can manage native C++ applications).

Squirrel uses NuGet packages to create installation and update packages, which means that you probably already know most of what you need to create an installer.

## What Do We Want?

Windows apps should be as fast and as easy to install and update as apps like Google Chrome. From an app developer's side, it should be really straightforward to create an installer for my app, and publish updates to it, without having to jump through insane hoops.

* **Integrating** an app to use Squirrel should be extremely easy, provide a client API, and be developer friendly.
* **Packaging** is really easy, can be automated, and supports delta update packages.
* **Distributing** should be straightforward, use simple HTTP updates, and provide multiple "channels" (a-la Chrome Dev/Beta/Release).
* **Installing** is Wizard-Free™, with no UAC dialogs, does not require reboot, and is .NET Framework friendly.
* **Updating** is in the background, doesn't interrupt the user, and does not require a reboot.

Refer to our full list of goals for [integrating, packaging, distributing, installing, and updating](/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/develop/docs/goals.md).

## Documentation

See the documentation [Table of Contents](/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/develop/docs/readme.md) for an overview of the available documentation for Squirrel.Windows. It includes a [Getting Started Guide](/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/develop/docs/getting-started/0-overview.md) as well as additional topics related to using Squirrel in your applications.

## Building Squirrel

For the impatient:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/squirrel/squirrel.windows
cd squirrel.windows
devbuild.cmd
```

# JVN#29902403 Installers generated by Squirrel.Windows may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries

## Overview

Installers generated by Squirrel.Windows may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries.

## Products Affected

* Installers generated by Squirrel.Windows 2.0.1 and earlier

## Description

Squirrel.Windows is both a toolset and a library that provides installation and update functionality for Windows desktop applications.

Installers generated by Squirrel.Windows contain an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).

## Impact

Arbitrary code may be executed with the privilege of the user invoking the installer.

## Solution

As of December 21, 2022, the fixed version is not provided.

According to the developer, there are no plans to release the fixed version soon, but the following fix was committed to 'develop' branch of the GitHub repository on June 1, 2021.

* [Better delay load urlmon and move official build to GH Actions #1807](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/pull/1807)

You should create Squirrel.Windows from the latest source code from 'develop' branch and use it to generate an installer.
