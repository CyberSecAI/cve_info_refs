Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw present in the `product_per_brand` page of the Helmet Store Showroom Site v1.0. Specifically, the `bid` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is not properly sanitizing or validating user input passed through the `bid` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as the database name. This can be a stepping stone to extract more sensitive information such as user credentials, product information, and potentially other application secrets.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to modify or delete data, and under certain conditions, potentially execute commands on the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with an injected SQL payload through the `bid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL queries to extract data.
- **No prior authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability**.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is: `/hss/?page=product_per_brand&bid=`
- A sample payload is: `/hss/?page=product_per_brand&bid=-2%27%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4,5,6--+`
- The database name is `hss_db`.
