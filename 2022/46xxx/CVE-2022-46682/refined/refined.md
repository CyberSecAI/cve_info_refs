Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46682:

**CVE-2022-46682**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Plot Plugin's XML parser is not configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. It does not disable external entity resolution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  XXE vulnerability. The plugin processes XML input without proper sanitization or disabling of external entity resolution.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who can control the XML input files for the 'Plot build data' build step can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.
    *   Perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to control the XML input file used by the "Plot build data" build step.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have the ability to control the XML input files used by the "Plot build data" build step in Jenkins. This likely requires having some level of access to configure jobs or inject malicious files into build processes.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text gives a good explanation of the vulnerability, the impact, and the fix.
* It also gives a good overview of the other security vulnerabilities in other plugins that were fixed in the same security advisory.
* The fix involves disabling external entity resolution for the XML parser within the Plot plugin.
