Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Judging Management System" application. Specifically, the `firstname` parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML within the victim's browser.
*  **Escalation of Privileges:** The attacker can potentially perform actions within the application on behalf of the user, possibly leading to privilege escalation depending on the application's features and permissions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects a crafted payload containing malicious script into the `firstname` parameter of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to submit input to the vulnerable parameter.
*   The attack can be launched remotely if the application is publicly accessible, or locally if the attacker has access to the system.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The affected product is identified as "Judging Management System - V 1.0" from sourcecodester.com
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sanjay Singh.

In summary, this is a classic reflected XSS vulnerability due to improper handling of user-supplied input, which can lead to code execution and potentially privilege escalation.
