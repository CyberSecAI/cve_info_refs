- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `paddle.audio.functional.get_window` function in PaddlePaddle uses `eval` on a user-supplied string (`winstr`) to determine the window function to be used.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection vulnerability due to the use of `eval` with untrusted input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the system where the vulnerable code is running.
- **Attack vectors:** Passing a malicious string as the `window` argument to the `paddle.audio.functional.get_window` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `window` argument passed to the vulnerable function.
