Fix: allow getting API token from environment

```
Allow the API token to be obtained from the environment variable
SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN. If it's passed on the command line, that value takes
precedence. For backwards compatibility, in case the user decides to NOT
replace the existing configuration files (in Debian these are config
files, and the user has the option to NOT replace them during an upgrade
if they have edited them, and because of the way we have set this up,
they *have* edited them).

In the shipped systemd service file, replace passing the token on the
command line in favor of passing it on the environment.

Use this mechanism in the shipped systemd service file.

# Default installation of `synthetic-monitoring-agent` exposes sensitive information

GHSA-9j4f-f249-q5w8

## Package

gomod

github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/cmd/synthetic-monitoring-agent
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.12.0

## Patched versions

0.12.0

## Description

### Impact

Users running the Synthetic Monitoring agent in their local network are impacted. The authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic Monitoring API is exposed thru a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to retrieve the Synthetic Monitoring checks created by the user and assigned to the agent identified with that token. The Synthetic Monitoring API will reject connections from already-connected agents, so access to the token does not guarantee access to the checks.

### Patches

Fixed version is v0.12.0

Users are advised to rotate the agent tokens.

After upgrading to version v0.12.0 or later, it's recommended that user's of distribution packages (e.g. Debian or RedHat and their derivatives) review the configuration stored in `/etc/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-monitoring-agent.conf`, specifically the `API_TOKEN` variable which has been renamed to `SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN`.

### Workarounds

With all previous versions, it's recommended that users review the agent settings and set the HTTP listening address in a manner that limits the exposure, for example, localhost or a non-routed network, by using the command line parameter `-listen-address`, e.g. `-listen-address localhost:4050`.

### References

The following changes have been made to address this issue:

* [Disable debug endpoint by default](https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/pull/373)
* [Allow retrieving the token from the environment](https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/pull/374)
* [Default to listening on localhost](https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/pull/375)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
