# Improper neutralization of an SQL parameter in Administrative Mandate payment module for PrestaShop

High

[clotairer](/clotairer)
published
GHSA-hg7m-23j3-rf56
Jan 28, 2023

## Package

totadministrativemandate
(PrestaShop)

## Affected versions

>= 1.2.1, < 1.7.2

## Patched versions

1.7.2

## Description

In the module "Administrative Mandate" (totadministrativemandate) edited by 202 ecommerce, an authenticated user can perform SQL injection in affected versions.

## Description

From version 1.2.1 published on 12 October 2012 to 1.7.2 published on 3 December 2020, a sensitive SQL calls in class `PDFMandate::mandatePDF()` (or `pdftot::MandatePDF()` for older version before 1.5) can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection.

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data on the associated PrestaShop

## Proof of concept

```
curl -v --cookie-jar cookie.txt 'https://domain.tld/authentification?submitLogin=1&emailXXXX&password=YYY && \
curl -v --cookie cookie.txt 'https://domain.tld/modules/totadministrativemandate/pdftot.php?id_order=1%27%3BSELECT%20SLEEP%2825%29%23'
```
## Sample patch for 1.6.2

## Other recommandations

* It’s recommended to upgrade the module beyong 1.7.2.
* Upgrade PrestaShop up to 1.7.8.8 to disable multi-query executions (separated by ";").
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
