{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows arbitrary file reads by using the `url` parameter in the `/api/Index/getFileBinary` endpoint without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary file read vulnerability",
    "Lack of input sanitization/validation"
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing database credentials, source code, or other confidential information. In the provided example, the attacker reads the `database.php` file, which contains database credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST request to `/api/Index/getFileBinary`",
    "Manipulating the `url` parameter to specify the file to be read"
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application and have knowledge of the file structure of the target application."
