The provided content is related to CVE-2022-46179.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variable in the authentication logic of LiuOS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The authentication check could be bypassed by setting the `GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variable to any value other than null or "true". This was due to a conditional check that only checked if the variable was not empty, rather than specifically requiring it to be "true".

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could bypass the authentication mechanism of LiuOS and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local; the attacker needs to be able to set environment variables on the machine running LiuOS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to set environment variables in the context where LiuOS is executed.
