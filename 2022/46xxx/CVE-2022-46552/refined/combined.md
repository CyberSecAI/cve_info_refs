# CVE-2022-46552: D-Link DIR-846 Wireless Router in firmware FW100A53DBR-Retail has vulnerability that leads to a RCE
## 1. Vulnerability Information
\*\*Authors\*\*: Françoa Taffarel Rosário Corrêa, Osmany Barros de Freitas and Lourenço Alves Pereira Junior.
\*\*Affiliation\*\*: Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ita.br)
\*\*Common Weakness Enumeration\*\*: CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
\*\*Vulnerability Description\*\*: D-Link DIR-846 Firmware FW100A53DBR was discovered to contain a remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability via the lan(0)\_dhcps\_staticlist parameter. This vulnerability is exploited via a crafted POST request.
\*\*The detail of vulnerability\*\*: The exploitation method corresponds to an injection command through a \*\*Authenticated user input with special characters\*\*. In this case, the file `SetIpMacBindSettings.php` (line 79) contains an `exec` function with a partially sanitized user input. Thus, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands by sending a maliciously crafted payload through a POST request. The HTTP message content is JSON-encoded and has the `lan(0)\_dhcps\_staticlist` key, a string with comma-separated values. Therefore, the attacker must insert the malicious payload in the second value, leading the web server in the D-Link DIR-846 to invoke `exec(changename.sh $mac "$(malicious\_payload\_command)")` on the host system.
\*\*Vendor of the product\*\*: D-LINK
\*\*Affected product\*\*: DIR-846
\*\*Affected Version\*\*: Firmware DIR846enFW100A53DBR-Retail
\*\*Vulnerability Score V3.1\*\*: [9.1 High AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:U/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:L/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H&version=3.1)

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

`FOR WINDOWS USERS

i had a look to start command. it's really usefull in fact.

this is how i launch a specific Apache SSL server

<?php
$cmd = "start /D C:\OpenSA\Apache /B Apache.exe -D SSL";
exec($cmd,$output,$rv);
?>

/D specify the path where application will be launched (equivalent to cd to path)
/B launch application without a console window

so to know the exact parameters of start, you could use

<?php
exec("start /? > start.txt");
?>

and you will get the help of start in a file named 'start.txt' in the same place you run the script

for WIN 98 you may need to modify a little your command

exec("COMMAND.COM /C START program args >NUL");

`at LAST! tenacity pays off, days trying every little thing!

I didn't want batch files. I'm trying to use PHP to get rid of batch files.

I didn't want to call a file to parse the parameters to call a shell to call a file. I've got "systems" right now with batches tiered three and five deep.

I just wanted to run stuff.

CALL, tested on WinXP, will be testing on more OSes right away, in PHP4 and 5, with exec, system, works with popen, and passthru.

here is my lame sample function.

// CreateZip
 function createzip ($target, $archive)
 { $ziputil = "call \"c:\\Program Files\\7-zip\\7z.exe\"";
 $archived = escapeshellarg($archive);
 $targeted = escapeshellarg($target);

 $shellcommand= $ziputil." a -tzip ".$archived." ".$targeted."\n";

 // all of the below are working in Win XP Pro
 passthru ($shellcommand);
 exec ($shellcommand);
 system ($shellcommand);
 shell_exec ($shellcommand);
 $proc= popen ($shellcommand, "r"); //$proc contains output

LONG PATH NAMES WITH SPACES IN THEM ON WINDOWS!

all in a big long concatenated command line with multiple quoted-filename parameters

shell scripting bliss!`

`Win32 / PHP 4.3.6...

If you plan to start programs on the server that show message boxes (things that require OK from the server-side), or remain (like notepad.exe), and the exec-command seems to go into an deadly loop, then MAYBE your program has started, but you can't see it. Because the web server runs as an system process, and it isn't allowed to interact with the desktop.

To solve a part of the problem (to see the programs you execute), in the control panel in Windows, goto Administration->Services, right-click the server-service, goto Properties and on the second tab (login?) and check the box about allowing the service to interact with the desktop. Click OK. Restart the webserver, and MAKE SURE it is restarted for real (i.e. look in the task manager so the service goes _down_), otherwise the desktop-option won't take.

Next phase would be to stop PHP from waiting for the processes to complete (this is what makes PHP "loop"). I solved this by creating a small Delphi-application that took the path to the file I wanted to execute and executed it by the WinExec API, which just starts the childprogram but doesn't wait for it to complete = the program completes and the PHP.exe completes the script. Problem solved!

Delphi-snippet:
WinExec(PChar(<CMD>),SW_SHOW); // replace <CMD> with the program path.`

`I found this comment on this page:

[begin of quote]
Trying to us the following code failed badly with various results: like "unable to fork", "access denied", "empty results", depending on what settings I used, ... even though the same code worked from command line on the server itself.

$retstr = exec('nslookup -type=mx myhost.com', $retarr);

Instead of nslookup I believe this would apply to most programs from the \system32\ directory.

I had to learn that the following finally worked:
$retstr = exec('c:\php\safedir\nslookup -type=mx myhost.com', $retarr);

... but only under the listed preconditions:
1: nslookup.exe is placed (copied) in the directory \php\safedir\
2: the directory \php\safedir\ is included in the system PATH environement variable
3: the file cmd.exe is placed in \php\ as listed by other notes above
4: the directory "c:\php\safedir\" is set in the php.ini setting
safe_mode_exec_dir = "c:\php\safedir\"
.. maybe set in php-activescript.ini as well, depending on your system setup.
5: nslookup is referenced by the full path as otherwise the file from \windows\system32\ will be called. This happend to me with empty result due to missing rights!

Hope this helps somebody saving some time and headaches.
[end of quote]

This is just to complicated. Only two things are needed:
1. Specific permissions for the IUSR account for read & execute to the cmd.exe in C:\Windows\System32 directory
2. Specific permissions for the IUSR account for read & execute to the command that's needed (example: nslookup.exe in C:\Widnows\System23 directory)

With just this two conditions the exec works fine

(This is for an IIS server running on a windows platform)`

`Hi

 I had problem with executing exec(),shell_exec() (PHP is not running on Safe Mode).

 After spending some time I was able to find out that the Problem is with SELinux enabled in my system.

 You can make sure about this by seeing the log /var/log/messages
 So I disabled SELinux and now everything works.

 A Temporary Disable to selinux #> setenforce 0;

 Since I felt this is not a good Idea I still went through some sites and find a solution which I felt good.

 Fedora's SELinux policy has some booleans - let's see what it has for our apache:
# /usr/sbin/getsebool -a | grep httpd
allow_httpd_anon_write -- off
allow_httpd_mod_auth_pam -- off
allow_httpd_sys_script_anon_write -- off
httpd_builtin_scripting -- on
httpd_can_network_connect -- off
httpd_can_network_connect_db -- off
httpd_can_network_relay -- off
httpd_disable_trans -- off
httpd_enable_cgi -- on
httpd_enable_ftp_server -- off
httpd_enable_homedirs -- on
httpd_rotatelogs_disable_trans -- off
httpd_ssi_exec --off
httpd_suexec_disable_trans -- off
httpd_tty_comm -- off
httpd_unified -- on

 From the above we can make sure that exec() is not working because of this httpd_ssi_exec -- off setting
 So I turned it On.

#> setsebool -P httpd_ssi_exec 1;

 Now I was able to see the output of shell_exec('ls -al')

`to lancelot:

it's simple exec($my_cmd) on windows executes 'cmd /c $my_cmd'
if there are any spaces in $my_cmd you have to put it in doublequotes:
cmd /c "$app $target" will work

further if there are any spaces in $app and $target they also have to be in doublequotes:
cmd /c ""$app" "$target""

therefore enclose your $cmd in two more doublequotes and dont forget to escape slashes \\

$cmd = "\"\"C:\\my path with spaces\\targetapp.exe\" \"C:\\mypathnospaces\\targetfile.xxx\"\"";

and exec($cmd) will work :)

`Scheduling WinXP tasks with schtasks.exe and using PHP to execute the command, may sometime fail to work.

This is because, Apache does not have the privilege to access some of the System Files when placing the scheduling. The way I'd do: is by creating a normal user account and assign Apache service to logon as that account.

Open the 'services.msc' in the 'Run' window, look for Apache in the listing, right click and get to 'Properties'. Click at the second tab 'Log On' and fill in the 'This account' fields.

Of course, Apache needs to be installed as Service during its first setup.

Hope this helps anyone.

`Just a simple note to help people get rid of some headaches.

when using:
<?
 $filepath = "the path of the file";
 exec("program -command $filepath ");
 fopen($filepath,rw);
?>

Make sure you use "\ " ( \ space) for the Linux\unix path and just " " space for fopen. These are both very basic things that you wouldn't normally think to cause a problem, but when you try to pass slashes to fopen it either breaks or even better works incorrectly =D. And vise versa for any programs that use "\ " for spaces in file paths/names.

I ran into this problem when using <? exec(" cp $path "); ?> and <? fopen("$path"); ?>. To fix it I used str_replace(" ","\ ",$path); and str_replace("\ ", " ",$path);

*Note this is alot of sudo code, and there are faster more effecient ways of doing the same operations, but I thought this might help those who were going crazy over filepaths =D.`

`Even more on the "unable to fork" error.

It was driving me crazy! I did check that the permissions were set for the IUSR_[server] account to read & exec cmd.exe. Yet still it failed. It wasn't until I got desperate that I happened to look in "special permissions." (Click the advanced tab underneath the regular list of permissions.) There I found that somehow the IUSR_[server] account had a special permission DENYING access! Of course deny overrides everything else.

This was a newly set up install of XP pro. It must be the default of something (I'd guess IIS) to set this deny permission just to make our lives miserable.`

`Just to clarify, background shell exec()ing is not the same as a fork() under Unix. It would be useful if PHP supported fork() like Perl and other scripting languages do. Simply exec()'ing a process and sending it to the background is not the same.

A true fork() copies the current environment and duplicates the running script so that there are two instances, one child, one parent. The child and parent can determine which copy they are and then take separate courses of execution paths based on that. Often one copy will perform some "busy work" while the other returns to normal execution. But no matter what, both functions live within the same code rather than a separate, external program. exec()ing can not do this for you.`

`Quick chart that helped me immensely (Best (+) / worst (o) of each command) and when to use each (w).

| exec(string cmd, [array cmd_output, [int cmd_exit_status]])
+- Second (optional) argument holds an array containing the output line by line.
+- Third (optional) argument holds the exit status of the executed program.
w- When the output of a command is only important to the program.

| system(string cmd, [int cmd_exit_status])
+- Echos ascii output straight to browser (only stdout; stderr must be redirected by putting 2>&1 after the command to see errors).
+- Second (optional) argument holds the exit status of the executed program.
w- When the output of a command is important to the user.

The more I go over my notes the less I care for the last two functions.
Shell_exec() = exec() + implode() - exit codes.
And while neccessary to be able to pipe binary through php, most people will never use passthru

| passthru(string cmd, [int cmd_exit_status])
+- Echos binary output directly to browser window.
+- Second (optional) argument holds the exit status of the executed program.
w- When the output of a command is binary.

| shell_exec(string cmd) <-- minimal features to maintain sync with normal use of backticks.
+- Returns full output as a string instead of directly to the browser (only stdout; stderr must be redirected).
o- No way to check exit status (Should use system() with both stderr and stdout redirected to /dev/null to get the exit code).`

`I was stuck for about an hour and a half last night trying to get Perl to pass back values to my PHP script after running an exec() command.

Since my Perl script was using STDOUT (after being passed command lines variables), I expected the variables used in my .pl script to be accessible in PHP, no questions asked.

Of course, this wasn't working and I finally figured it out with the help of a friend (Shawn = superstar): you need to echo the exec() command in order to get the values back into PHP.

Since I was returning multiple values, I added pipe delimiters in my .pl script and then used PHP to parse the string to retreive my data into different variables.

Check it out:

#hit the .pl script with the data
$mydata = exec("script.pl 'command line args' ");
exec("exit(0)");

#parse the value that comes back from the .pl script
list($strA, $strB) = split ('[|]', $mydata);
echo "valueA: " . $strA."<br>";
echo "valueB: " . $strB."<br>";

`MORE ON THE UNABLE TO FORK MESSAGES IN WINDOWS:

I would like to confirm that this issue relates to permissions on %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32. The user (usually the anonymous login) must have execute permissions on cmd.exe

This is unlike most other programming languages. For example, in C the spawn and exec functions do not try to open a shell, they create the new process directly. PHP creates the new process via cmd.exe (or command.com) much like the C system() function. This is good for those of you who are trying to run batch files but this is very ineffecient for running other .exe files.

I feel uneasy about lifting permissions in my system32 directory but you can get around this by copying cmd.exe to your PHP directory. Windows will look there first and if it is not there it will check the path. Note: I mean the directory where php.exe is, not your script directory.

I have confirmed this by running filemon.exe while trying to execute a script, and you can see it trying to start the cmd.exe process.`

`AFICT, the standard Unix Apache configuration causes an rare problem when running a job in the background. The MaxRequestsPerChild directive causes the child to terminate after 1000 requests, any background processes associated with the child will die with the child unless they are started with the "nohup" command. Thus, the proper way to start a job in the background is to use:

exec('nohup my-command > /dev/null 2>&1 &')`

Keep in mind that a lot of UNABLE TO FORK Errors are the result of insufficient permissions.

CMD.EXE, TEMP Directory (or whatever you specified in php.ini), and all the directories that you use to upload o manipulate your files need to have Write privileges? usually user USER.

`Re: session_write_close()

To launch a background process within a session, I recommend
to use a start-stop-daemon and ship parameters via ENV.

Example:
----------------------------------------
<?php
 // Within a session..
 exec("/some/where/launch.sh 300");
 // ..finished immediately.
?>

----------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
# /some/where/launch.sh
T=$1
export T
DAEMON=/some/where/runme.pl
start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --background --exec $DAEMON

# /some/where/runme.pl
my $t = $ENV{'T'};

`Lets make it even clearer, about the "unable to fork" error in exec().

By default Windows XP sets all permissions for cmd.exe for the temporary internet user account (IUSER-[computername]) to DENY. That overrides everthing.

You must modify the security on cmd.exe to give the IUSER-computername account at least read & execute and remove the DENY.`

`Trying to use 'exec' to run a helper executable on Win2K3 (and I'm told this also happens on Win2K) from a PHP script running on IIS, failed to invoke the executable.

Running the same PHP script on Win2K using Apache to serve the page calling the same helper executable worked.

Solution: On Win2K3 (and probably Win2K), give the IIS IUSR_xxxxx guest user Read & Execute permissions to Cmd.exe found in the System32 folder under Windows root directory.

This one had me confused longer than it should have! Hope this saves others from the same fate!`

`I needed to know when a group of background tasks, which had been launched with a call to system, had terminated.
I could not find a function to call, so I created a little function.

It basically loops on the existance of a string in the results returned by the command ps.

All my commands, which run in background have the pid returned by posix_getpid in them.

I am able to launch many background task and effectively wait for them all to finish.

Before this, I would basically would sleep for N seconds.

I apologise if a well known or better method exist.

Thanks,

# CVE-2022-46552: D-Link DIR-846 Wireless Router in firmware FW100A53DBR-Retail has vulnerability that leads to a RCE

## 1. Vulnerability Information

**Authors**: Françoa Taffarel Rosário Corrêa, Osmany Barros de Freitas and Lourenço Alves Pereira Junior.

**Affiliation**: Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ita.br)

**Common Weakness Enumeration**: CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

**Vulnerability Description**: D-Link DIR-846 Firmware FW100A53DBR was discovered to contain a remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability via the lan(0)\_dhcps\_staticlist parameter. This vulnerability is exploited via a crafted POST request.

**The detail of vulnerability**: The exploitation method corresponds to an injection command through a **Authenticated user input with special characters**. In this case, the file `SetIpMacBindSettings.php` (line 79) contains an `exec` function with a partially sanitized user input. Thus, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands by sending a maliciously crafted payload through a POST request. The HTTP message content is JSON-encoded and has the `lan(0)_dhcps_staticlist` key, a string with comma-separated values. Therefore, the attacker must insert the malicious payload in the second value, leading the web server in the D-Link DIR-846 to invoke `exec(changename.sh $mac "$(malicious_payload_command)")` on the host system.

**Vendor of the product**: D-LINK

**Affected product**: DIR-846

**Affected Version**: Firmware DIR846enFW100A53DBR-Retail

**Vulnerability Score V3.1**: [9.1 High AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:U/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:L/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H&version=3.1)

Cybersecurity presents itself as a crucial area in the Information Technology sector. Thus, incidents in this sector could cause economic disruption, financial losses, geopolitical tensions, and social instability. In addition, since December 2019, due to mobility restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, several companies have started extending remote work.

However, working from home expands the constraint on corporate networks, exposing digital assets to new threats and vulnerabilities. Consequently, the attack surface presents an increasing pattern. Furthermore, access to private networks is usually via electronic equipment, known as small-office and home-office (SOHO) routers, potentially livelier than corporate solutions.

In this context, we found CVE-2022–46552 | D-Link DIR-846 Wireless Router in firmware **FW100A53DBR-Retail** has a vulnerability that leads to an RCE.

**Authors**

This research project has been conducted by Lab-C2DC — Laboratory of Command and Control and Cyber-security at [ITA.](http://ita.br)

[**Lourenço Alves Pereira Junior;**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lourenco-pereira/)

[**Osmany Barros de Freitas;**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osmany-freitas/) **and**

[**Françoa Taffarel Rosário Corrêa**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoataffarel)**.**

**Vulnerability Description**: D-Link DIR-846 Firmware FW100A53DBR was discovered to contain a remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability via the lan(0)\_dhcps\_staticlist parameter. This vulnerability is exploited via a crafted POST request.

**Authors:** Françoa Taffarel Rosário Corrêa, Osmany Barros de Freitas and Lourenço Alves Pereira Junior.

**Affiliation:** Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ita.br)

**Common Weakness Enumeration**: CWE-78 — Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

**Vendor of the product**: D-LINK

**Affected product**: DIR-846

**Affected Version:** Firmware DIR846enFW100A53DBR-Retail

**Vulnerability Score V3.1**: [9.1 High AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H]([https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:U/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:L/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H&version=3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV%3AN%2FAC%3AL%2FPR%3AL%2FUI%3AR%2FS%3AC%2FC%3AH%2FI%3AH%2FA%3AH%2FE%3AH%2FRL%3AU%2FRC%3AC%2FCR%3AH%2FIR%3AH%2FAR%3AH%2FMAV%3AN%2FMAC%3AL%2FMPR%3AL%2FMUI%3AR%2FMS%3AC%2FMC%3AH%2FMI%3AH%2FMA%3AH&version=3.1))

**The detail of vulnerability:** The exploitation method corresponds to an injection command through **a authenticated user input** with special characters. In this case, the file `SetIpMacBindSettings.php` (line 79) contains an `exec` function with a partially sanitized user input. Thus, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands by sending a maliciously crafted payload through a POST request. The HTTP message content is JSON-encoded and has the `lan(0)_dhcps_staticlist` key, a string with comma-separated values. Therefore, the attacker must insert the malicious payload in the second value, leading the web server in the D-Link DIR-846 to invoke `exec(changename.sh $mac "$(malicious_payload_command)")` on the host system.
