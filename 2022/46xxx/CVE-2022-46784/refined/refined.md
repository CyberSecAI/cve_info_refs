- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Client-side open redirection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to open redirection, which occurs when a web application redirects users to a different website based on user-supplied input. An attacker can manipulate the redirection URL to point to a malicious site, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website. This can be used for phishing attacks, where users are tricked into entering sensitive information on a fake site that looks like a legitimate one, or to distribute malware.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through manipulation of the redirection URL, likely through query parameters or other user-supplied input that controls the redirection target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to influence the redirection URL to redirect users to an attacker-controlled site.
