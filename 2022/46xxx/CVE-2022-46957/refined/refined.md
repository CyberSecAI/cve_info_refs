Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or encoding in the "Online Graduate Tracer System" when handling user-provided input, specifically in the `name` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS, specifically a stored or persistent XSS type. This means that the malicious script is stored within the application itself and is executed when a user views the affected area.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This could lead to:
   - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, granting the attacker access to the user's account.
   - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites to infect their computers with malware.
   - **Defacement:** Altering the content of the web page.
   - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Parameter:** The vulnerability exists within the `name=` parameter.
- **Malicious Payload:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into this parameter.
- **Persistent XSS:** Because the attack type is specified as "Local", it is implied that the injected code is stored in the application's database or file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Vulnerable Input:** The attacker needs to find an input field where the `name` parameter is used.
- **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious JavaScript payloads that will execute within a victim's browser context.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content indicates that the impact includes "Code execution", this is expected for an XSS attack.
- The content mentions "Local" attack type, which seems to contradict with typical XSS, this might be a misunderstanding in the report.
