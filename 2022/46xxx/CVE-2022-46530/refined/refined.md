The provided content is related to CVE-2022-46530.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` module of the Tenda F1203 router firmware. This occurs when handling the `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` request. The vulnerability is triggered by an overly long `mac` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow. The `mac` parameter in the `GetParentControlInfo` function is not properly validated and allows for writing data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) causes a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. It is not explicitly stated if other impacts such as remote code execution are possible, but the buffer overflow suggests that arbitrary code execution might be possible if exploited further.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` endpoint with an overly long `mac` parameter triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device. This typically implies the attacker must be on the same network as the router or have remote access to the network.
- The attacker needs to know that the `user` cookie needs to be set to `admin` .
