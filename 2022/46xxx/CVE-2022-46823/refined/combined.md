SUMMARY

The Mendix SAML module is affected by a reﬂected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could
allow an attacker to extract sensitive information by tricking users into accessing a malicious link. Apps
are only vulnerable in certain cases when non-default conﬁguration is used.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Mendix SAML module allows you to use SAML to authenticate your users in your cloud application. This
module can communicate with any identity provider that supports SAML2.0 or Shibboleth.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-46823

The affected module is vulnerable to reﬂected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This could allow an
attacker to extract sensitive information by tricking users into accessing a malicious link.
