- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by cleartext storage of sensitive information (access level password) in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is classified as CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory. Specifically, the access level password of SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-1500 CPUs is stored in memory without proper encryption when entered by a legitimate user in the hardware configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could gain access to the access level password of the SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-1500 CPUs.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with high privileges and requiring user interaction can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system, high privileges and needs a legitimate user to enter the password.
