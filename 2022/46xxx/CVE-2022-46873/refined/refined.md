Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46873:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Firefox did not correctly implement the `unsafe-hashes` Content Security Policy (CSP) directive. Specifically, Firefox incorrectly allowed inline event handler script execution even when `unsafe-hashes` was not specified in the CSP, if the script's hash matched a hash in the `script-src` directive.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect CSP enforcement:** The primary vulnerability was the failure to adhere to the CSP specification, which dictates that inline event handlers should be blocked unless explicitly allowed via 'unsafe-inline' or 'unsafe-hashes'.
- **Bypass of intended CSP restrictions:** The incorrect behavior allowed attackers to bypass CSP restrictions meant to prevent inline script execution, even when a hash was provided for the script content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Script injection:** An attacker could inject and execute malicious scripts within the context of a website that was otherwise protected by CSP. Although the impact was somewhat limited by other CSP restrictions, it could still allow for XSS attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Markup injection:** The attack requires the ability to inject markup into a website. This could be achieved through various means like exploiting other vulnerabilities or by compromising legitimate content sources.
- **Inline event handlers:** The injected markup would need to include inline event handlers that contain the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Markup injection capability:** The attacker needs a way to inject malicious markup into a vulnerable page.
- **Knowledge of CSP policy:**  The attacker needs some understanding of the CSP configuration of the target website. The exploitation is somewhat constrained by the specified content security policy of the document.
- **No requirement for interaction**:  This vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction, other than the user browsing the compromised website with a vulnerable version of Firefox.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- **Regression:** This vulnerability was introduced in Firefox 63 and fixed in Firefox 108.
- **Workaround:** Setting `security.csp.unsafe-hashes.enabled` to `true` will make the page function as intended, but it does so by activating unsafe-hashes which is not the intended fix.
- **Affected versions:** Firefox versions 63 to 107, and Firefox ESR versions prior to 102.7, were vulnerable.
- **Fix:** The fix involves properly implementing the `unsafe-hashes` directive and only allowing inline event handler script execution via `script-src` hashes if `unsafe-hashes` is specified in the CSP.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability was rated as "moderate" by Mozilla.
