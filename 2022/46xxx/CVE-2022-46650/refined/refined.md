Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-46650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)** vulnerability in Sierra Wireless AirLink routers running ALEOS software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability allows a user with valid ACEManager credentials to reconfigure the device in a way that exposes ACEManager credentials on the pre-login status page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive information (ACEManager credentials). This could further allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a user with valid ACEManager credentials and access to the ACEManager interface. This means the attacker needs to have already obtained some level of access to the router's management interface.
* The vulnerability is triggered through a device reconfiguration that exposes sensitive information on a publicly accessible page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs valid ACEManager credentials.
*   The attacker must have access to the ACEManager interface.
*   The attacker has to reconfigure the device to expose the credentials on the pre-login status page.

**Additional Details:**
*   The document provides a CVSS v3 base score of 4.5 with the vector string: AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, which indicates:
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    *  **PR:H (High):** The attacker needs high level privileges to exploit this vulnerability, meaning they need valid ACEManager credentials.
    *   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required to perform the exploitation, meaning the attacker needs to reconfigure the device to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not affect resources outside of the affected component.
    *   **C:H (High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:N (None):** There is no impact on integrity.
    *   **A:N (None):** There is no impact on availability.

*   The document notes that the vulnerability affects:
    *   Airlink Router (ES450, GX450) running ALEOS software: Versions 4.9.7 and prior
    *   Airlink Router (MP70, RV50, RV50x, RV55, LX 40, LX60) running ALEOS software: Versions prior to 4.16.0
