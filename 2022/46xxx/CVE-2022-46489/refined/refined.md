Based on the provided information, this GitHub issue report relates to a memory leak vulnerability in the GPAC project, specifically in the `gf_isom_box_parse_ex` function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak that occurs in the `gf_isom_box_parse_ex` function located in `box_funcs.c:166:13`.
- There is also a memory leak in `gf_gz_decompress_payload` called by `gf_isom_box_parse_ex`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: Memory is allocated using `malloc` but is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak can cause the application to consume excessive amounts of memory.
-  In a long-running application or with repeated processing of malicious files, this can lead to performance degradation, instability, and potentially application crash due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted MP4 file that triggers the vulnerable code path in `gf_isom_box_parse_ex`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when parsing an MP4 file that contains a specific box type (`!ssx` (0x21737378)), for which the payload decompression fails, but the allocated memory is not released.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable application.
- No specific privilege is required; the attacker can be in the position of a user of the vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
- The report provides a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) MP4 file.
- AddressSanitizer output shows the memory leak, specifically the `malloc` call and the functions where the leaks occur.
- The issue was closed as completed with a fix, commit `44e8616`.
