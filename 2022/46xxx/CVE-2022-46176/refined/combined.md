In the distros thread leading to the above oss-security posting, Pietro
Albini also wrote:

I think the libgit2 issue was never brought to oss-security, so I am
passing its mention to here now.  Also per that thread, CVE-2022-46176
is only for the Cargo issue.  libgit2 was supposed to get its own CVE,
but no one in the thread knew whether they actually did.

I don't know whether libgit2 was actually fixed on that date as planned.

P.S. I'm quoting the rest of the oss-security posting I'm "replying" to
below, for context since it's been a while.

The Rust project was in contact with the libgit2 maintainers to coordinate the
two disclosures (that's why we mentioned it in the distros email), but some
miscommunication happened and the libgit2 side of the advisory didn't end up
being posted here by its maintainers.

libgit2's advisory is available here, and has CVE-2023-22742 assigned to it:

<https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq>

 > I don't know whether libgit2 was actually fixed on that date as planned.

The libgit2 advisory and fix ended up being published later, on January 20th.

Pietro.

## Cargo did not verify SSH host keys

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-r5w3-xm58-jv6j)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-r5w3-xm58-jv6j/dependabot)

## Package

cargo

cargo
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 0.67.0

## Patched versions

0.67.1

## Description

The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not perform SSH host key verification when cloning indexes and dependencies via SSH. An attacker could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-46176](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r5w3-xm58-jv6j "CVE-2022-46176").

## Overview

When an SSH client establishes communication with a server, to prevent MITM attacks the client should check whether it already communicated with that server in the past and what the server's public key was back then. If the key changed since the last connection, the connection must be aborted as a MITM attack is likely taking place.

It was discovered that Cargo never implemented such checks, and performed no validation on the server's public key, leaving Cargo users vulnerable to MITM attacks.

## Affected Versions

All Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 are vulnerable (prior to 0.67.1 for the crates.io package).

Note that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternate registry indexes or crate dependencies, you might be affected by this vulnerability if you have configured git to replace HTTPS connections to GitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-urlltbasegtinsteadOf) setting), as that'd cause you to clone the crates.io index through SSH.

## Mitigations

We will be releasing Rust 1.66.1 today, 2023-01-10, changing Cargo to check the SSH host key and abort the connection if the server's public key is not already trusted. We recommend everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.

Patch files for Rust 1.66.0 are also available [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response/tree/main/patches/CVE-2022-46176) for custom-built toolchains.

For the time being Cargo will not ask the user whether to trust a server's public key during the first connection. Instead, Cargo will show an error message detailing how to add that public key to the list of trusted keys. Note that this might break your automated builds if the hosts you clone dependencies or indexes from are not already trusted.

If you can't upgrade to Rust 1.66.1 yet, we recommend configuring Cargo to use the `git` CLI instead of its built-in git support. That way, all git network operations will be performed by the `git` CLI, which is not affected by this vulnerability. You can do so by adding this snippet to your [Cargo configuration file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html):

```
[net]
git-fetch-with-cli = true
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
