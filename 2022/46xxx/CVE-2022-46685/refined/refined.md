The provided content is related to CVE-2022-46685.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Gitea Plugin, prior to version 1.4.5, did not implement proper credentials masking for Gitea personal access tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper credentials masking. Specifically, the plugin did not prevent Gitea personal access tokens from being exposed in build logs, for example when printed as part of repository URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exposure of Gitea personal access tokens. This can lead to unauthorized access to the associated Gitea repositories and resources.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to the tokens by viewing the Jenkins build logs. The tokens could be visible when repository URLs which include the token are printed to the logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to view the Jenkins build logs, which can be achieved with low privileges and no user interaction.
