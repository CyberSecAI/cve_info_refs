- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `saveParentControlInfo` function within the Tenda F1203 router's `httpd` module. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the `urls` parameter into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without any bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of `strcpy` to copy the `urls` parameter to a stack buffer `dest` at `(char *)dest + 80`, which is 512 bytes long, without proper size validation. This enables a buffer overflow if the `urls` parameter exceeds this size.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The provided PoC demonstrates that a specially crafted `urls` parameter can cause a denial of service (DoS), which can lead to the router crashing or becoming unstable.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to `/goform/saveParentControlInfo`, by providing an overly long string in the `urls` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This would typically require being on the same network or having access to the network where the router is located. Authentication is required (cookie `user=admin`) in the provided PoC, meaning the attacker needs to either be authenticated or to have the ability to bypass authentication.
