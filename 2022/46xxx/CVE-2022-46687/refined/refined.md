**CVE-2022-46687**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Spring Config Plugin does not properly escape build display names when displayed on the Spring Config view.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the build display names, which will be executed when a user views the Spring Config page. This can lead to the attacker gaining access to sensitive information, control over the user's session or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be able to change build display names which would be achieved via a user with at least project configure permissions. The malicious payload is then executed when another user views the Spring Config page.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to change build display names (at least project configure permission is required) and must trick a user into visiting the vulnerable Spring Config view page to execute the malicious payload.
