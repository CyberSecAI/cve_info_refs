The provided content is related to CVE-2022-46286.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software fails to properly restrict XML external entity references, potentially allowing the inclusion of malicious external content when parsing XML files.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from the target device.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring a user to open a specially crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious XML file. They also need to social engineer a valid user of the vulnerable software to open the file, meaning the attacker must have a position where they can provide a crafted file to the user, such as via email.
