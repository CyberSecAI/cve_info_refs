- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "The Post Grid" (versions <= 5.0.4) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker crafts a malicious request that is triggered by a logged-in user, thus exploiting the trust between the user and the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering the crafted request. The attacker is not required to be authenticated themselves.
