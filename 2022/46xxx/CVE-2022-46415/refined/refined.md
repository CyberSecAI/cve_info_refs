Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of mutual authentication in the DHCP implementation of Wi-Fi-based commercial drones. Specifically, the DHCP server allocates IP addresses based on MAC addresses without verifying the legitimacy of the connecting device. This allows an attacker to send spoofed DHCP DISCOVER packets with fake MAC addresses, which the DHCP server treats as legitimate requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of mutual authentication in DHCP: The DHCP server does not verify the authenticity of MAC addresses requesting IP addresses, allowing spoofed requests.
- DHCP server's reliance on MAC address for IP allocation: The server allocates IP addresses solely based on MAC addresses, making it vulnerable to spoofing.
-  Vulnerable DHCP implementation: The drone's DHCP server is not robust enough to handle a large influx of connection requests, even if illegitimate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The attacker can exhaust all available IP addresses on the drone's DHCP server, preventing legitimate devices from connecting to the drone's internal network.
- Loss of Access to Drone Services: By preventing legitimate connections, the attacker effectively denies the owner access to the drone's services and functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker must be within the Wi-Fi range of the drone's network.
- Exploitation requires access to the droneâ€™s network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to connect to the drone's Wi-Fi network: This might require techniques such as password cracking or other means of network penetration.
- Ability to send manipulated DHCP packets: The attacker needs the tools to generate and send malformed DHCP DISCOVER packets with fake MAC addresses.
-  An attacker needs to be on the same network as the drone.

**Additional Details:**
- The report mentions the use of a modified DHCPig tool to carry out the attack, as the standard tool doesn't work in the drone's environment due to DHCP Server Identifier differences.
- The report details the process of DHCP connection, including DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST and ACK packets.
-  The vulnerability was tested against a DJI Spark drone.
- The report provides screenshots of packet captures using Wireshark to visualize the attack.
-  The vulnerability was tested and confirmed through experiments, with the connection attempts shown in figures.
- The CVSS v3 score is provided with all metrics.
- The corresponding CWE is CWE-1037.
