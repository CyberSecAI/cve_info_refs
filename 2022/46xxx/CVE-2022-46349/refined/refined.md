Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-46349:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the application while parsing specially crafted X_B files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The application attempts to read data from a memory location beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated in the summary, out-of-bounds reads can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information if the read accesses protected memory regions.
- **Denial of Service:** Although not explicit, out-of-bounds reads may lead to a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a maliciously crafted X_B file.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening the malicious file with an affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious X_B file.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the crafted X_B file.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Parasolid and Solid Edge.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI-CAN-19384).
