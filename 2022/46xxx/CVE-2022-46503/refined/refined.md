The provided content describes a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Online Student Enrollment System v1.0 by donbermoy.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `name` parameter of the `/student_enrollment/admin/register.php` file. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application echoes back the user-supplied 'name' parameter without sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking (stealing cookies), redirecting users to malicious websites, defacing the website, or other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/student_enrollment/admin/register.php` endpoint. The malicious script is injected into the 'name' parameter of the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious payload in the 'name' parameter.

The provided content includes detailed information, including the vulnerable file path, the vulnerable parameter, and two example payloads demonstrating the XSS vulnerability. It also includes the full HTTP request that can be used to exploit the vulnerability and screenshots. This is more detail than is generally included in a CVE description.
