- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in an unauthenticated Express.js API endpoint that changes the active WiFi network. The server binds to 0.0.0.0, making it accessible from any device on the network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) via command injection
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  - Remote Wireless Reconfiguration (RWR)
  - Unsanitized user input passed to `execCommand`
  - Server binding to 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Remote code execution on the target Windows desktop.
  - Arbitrary command execution (e.g. spawning calculator, fully fledged shell)
  - Remote wireless reconfiguration leading to potential Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
  - Possible file uploads/downloads and further command execution via a fully fledged shell
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/validateWifiPassword` endpoint on port 56751 of the target machine. The request must have a JSON body containing the malicious SSID as the `name` attribute of the `new_network` object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - Attacker must be on the same network as the target device since the webserver binds to 0.0.0.0, meaning it is accessible by any device on the network.
  - Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint (`/validateWifiPassword`).
  - Ability to send HTTP requests to the target device.
