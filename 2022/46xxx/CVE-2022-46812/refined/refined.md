- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions that can be triggered through the CSRF vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted request that is triggered by an authenticated user, which can be done through a link or a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges but they must target an authenticated user. The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into triggering a malicious request.
