{
  "CVE-2022-46285": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly handle unclosed comments within XPM files. The ParseComment() function does not detect the end-of-file condition when processing an unclosed comment, leading to an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of end-of-file conditions",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service. Applications using libXpm may experience an infinite loop and become unresponsive due to excessive CPU consumption.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafting a malicious XPM file containing an unclosed comment.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide the crafted XPM file to an application using the vulnerable library for parsing."
