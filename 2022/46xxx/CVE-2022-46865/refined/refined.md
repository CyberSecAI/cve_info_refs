- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Bulk Resize Media plugin <= 1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, allowing an attacker to force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could include modifying settings or performing other administrative tasks on the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that triggers the unwanted action on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but they need to trick an authenticated user into performing actions.
