# Reflected XSS

Moderate

[czgu](/czgu)
published
GHSA-mrrw-9wf7-xq6w
Dec 5, 2022

## Package

querybook/querybook
(dockerhub)

## Affected versions

<3.14.2

## Patched versions

3.14.2

## Description

### Impact

User provided data is not escaped in the error field of the auth callback url in `querybook/server/app/auth/oauth_auth.py` and `querybook/server/app/auth/okta_auth.py`. This may allow attackers to perform reflected XSS if CSP (Content Security Policy) is not enabled or `unsafe-inline` is allowed.

### Patches

* Upgrade to the latest, patched version of querybook (version `3.14.2` or greater)

### Workarounds

* Enable [CSP](https://content-security-policy.com/) and do not allow `unsafe-inline`
* Escape query parameters in a reverse proxy
* WAF could be helpful but is unreliable (see [here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#other-controls))

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
