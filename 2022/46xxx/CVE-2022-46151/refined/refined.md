Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper output sanitization in the error handling of the OAuth callback within the `oauth_auth.py` and `okta_auth.py` files of the Querybook application. Specifically, the error message from the OAuth provider, which is passed as a query parameter, is directly included in the HTML response without escaping special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. This occurs when user-supplied input (in this case, the error query parameter) is reflected back to the user's browser without proper encoding or sanitization.
- Lack of Output Encoding: The application fails to escape or encode the error message, allowing the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the victim's browser, in the context of the vulnerable application. This can lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Cookie theft
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Data exfiltration
  - Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL containing a malicious script in the `error` query parameter of the OAuth callback URL.
- An attacker needs to entice a user to click on a malicious crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the application server itself to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL, which will be interpreted by the victim's browser.
- Social engineering may be required to get the victim to click on the malicious link.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is considered moderate with a CVSS score of 5.5.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves escaping the error message using `Markup.escape()` function.
- The vulnerability is present in Querybook versions prior to 3.14.2.
-  The report suggests mitigating the issue by enabling CSP and not allowing `unsafe-inline`. It also suggests escaping query parameters in a reverse proxy, or using a WAF, although it marks the WAF option as unreliable.
- The advisory was published by "czgu" on December 5, 2022.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
-  The fix is present in commit `88a7f10495bf5ed1a556ade51a2f2794e403c063`
