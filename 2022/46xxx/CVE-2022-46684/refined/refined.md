The provided content is related to CVE-2022-46684.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Checkmarx plugin processes Checkmarx service API responses and generates HTML reports without properly escaping values, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper output escaping when rendering HTML reports.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the HTML reports generated by the plugin. When a user views these reports through the Jenkins UI, the injected script executes in their browser context. This can result in a compromise of user accounts, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code within the Checkmarx service API responses, which are then rendered within the Jenkins UI. While users without Overall/Administer permission cannot configure the URL to the Checkmarx service directly, a man-in-the-middle attack can be used to modify the responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to manipulate the Checkmarx service API responses, either through direct access or a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker does not need to be a Jenkins administrator. They would need the ability to cause a build to be performed that utilizes the Checkmarx plugin.
