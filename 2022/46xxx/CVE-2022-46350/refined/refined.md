- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The integrated web server lacks proper input sanitization, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trigger malicious requests on the affected device by tricking users into accessing a malicious link. This could lead to session hijacking, information disclosure, or other malicious actions depending on the XSS payload.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker tricks unsuspecting users into accessing a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and lure a user into clicking it while being on the same network as the target device.
