{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Advanced Database Cleaner plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized database modifications or other administrative changes.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that is triggered when a logged-in administrator or other privileged user interacts with it. This could be done via social engineering or by embedding the malicious request in a website or email.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to authenticate, but needs a privileged user to execute the crafted request."
