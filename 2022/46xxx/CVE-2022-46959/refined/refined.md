The provided content relates to CVE-2022-46959.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation in the file backup functionality of the Sonic application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate the provided path, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary paths using directory traversal sequences like `../../`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application allows the user to specify the directory to backup, and does not properly validate the path provided. This allows an attacker to use directory traversal sequences in order to back up files outside of the intended directory.
- Lack of input validation: The application is vulnerable due to the lack of checks on the input provided by the user, allowing them to specify any path on the server file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially back up any file on the server accessible by the application. This can lead to:
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive files could be backed up and potentially accessed by the attacker.
- Data exfiltration: An attacker can back up files they are not meant to have access to.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/api/admin/backups/work-dir` endpoint with a directory traversal sequence in the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in to the admin panel of the Sonic application.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the API endpoint and the structure of the request.
