Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the Dynamic Transaction Queuing System v1.0, specifically within the `delete_window` action of the `ajax.php` file. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input when constructing the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) into a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The provided payload uses `updatexml()` function to extract the database name. The attacker can use this to potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- Full Database Control: With further exploitation the attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database, compromising the integrity and availability of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to the `/queuing/admin/ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `delete_window`.
- Malicious `id` Parameter: The vulnerable parameter is `id`, which is included in the POST request body. The attacker injects SQL code within this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the application's web server to send HTTP requests.
- Authentication: The provided information suggests that the attacker needs to be logged into an admin account to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided payload `id=1 and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)` demonstrates the vulnerability, leaking the database name.
- The system uses XAMPP with PHP 8.1 and the database is named `queuing_db`.
- The login credentials for an administrator account are provided as `admin/admin123`.
