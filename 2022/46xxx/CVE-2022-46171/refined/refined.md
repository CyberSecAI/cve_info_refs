Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the overly permissive nature of the glob pattern matching within the Tauri filesystem scope. Specifically, the `*`, `?`, and `[...]` wildcards in glob patterns were matching not only intended files but also path literals and leading dots by default. This was due to the default settings of the `glob` crate used by Tauri.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The glob pattern matching did not sufficiently restrict access to files and directories based on the provided patterns.
*   **Permissive Default Settings:** The `glob` crate's default settings for `require_literal_separator` and `require_literal_leading_dot` were `false`, leading to unintended access to subdirectories and hidden files.
*   **Bypass of Intended Scope:** The vulnerability allowed access to subdirectories even when the recursive option was not set, and to hidden files/folders without explicit permission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially read files and directories that were not intended to be accessible through the Tauri application's filesystem scope. This includes sensitive files located in subfolders or hidden directories (e.g., `.ssh` folder) that were not explicitly allowed by the developer.
*   **Unintended Access:** The vulnerability allowed the reading of sub-directories even when the `recursive` option was set to false, circumventing the developers intention.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** The primary attack vector is through the Tauri application's file system API, where the vulnerability is present in the glob matching logic when defining the scope. An attacker could craft file path patterns that exploit the permissive glob matching, leading to unauthorized access to files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Interact with the Tauri API:** An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the Tauri application using the exposed file system API with the crafted file path patterns. The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application via the exposed API.
*   **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability could be exploited with low privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Tauri versions 1.0.0 to 1.0.7, 1.1.0 to 1.1.2, 1.2.0 to 1.2.2 and 2.0.0-alpha.0 to 2.0.0-alpha.1 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** Tauri versions 1.0.8+, 1.1.3+, 1.2.3+, and 2.0.0-alpha.2+ contain the fix.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed by changing the `glob` crate's `MatchOptions` to `require_literal_separator: true` and `require_literal_leading_dot: true`, which ensures that wildcards do not match path separators or leading dots by default. This fixes the unintended access to subdirectories and hidden files.
*   The advisory also noted that case-sensitivity option only affects ASCII paths.
