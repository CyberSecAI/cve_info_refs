Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the CloudSchool application. Specifically, when creating an employee, user-provided data, such as the employee's name, isn't sanitized before being stored and displayed in notifications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database, which is later executed in the browser of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking/Cookie Stealing:** By executing JavaScript code, an attacker can potentially steal session cookies of other users, including admin users, leading to account compromise.
- **Malicious Script Execution:** The attacker can execute any arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This may include actions like redirecting users to malicious sites or performing actions on the user's behalf.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker (with limited permissions) can potentially escalate their privileges by compromising the superadmin user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the employee creation functionality. A user with limited privileges, "admin1", can input a malicious script as part of an employee's name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to have a user account with the ability to create, edit, or delete employees (e.g. 'admin1' in the scenario).
- **Technical Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and inject a malicious JavaScript payload.
- **User Interaction:** The victim user (e.g. 'superadmin') needs to log in to the application and trigger the display of the notification that contains the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in CloudSchool v3.0.1, and the vendor did not respond to vulnerability reports.
- The XSS payload is executed when a user receives a notification containing unsanitized data from the database.
