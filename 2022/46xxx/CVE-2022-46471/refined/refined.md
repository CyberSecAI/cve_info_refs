Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `consulting_id` GET parameter in `/healthcare/Admin/consulting_detail.php` is directly incorporated into a SQL query without any sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection, evidenced by the successful use of the `sleep()` function to delay the server response.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive data, modify data, or potentially compromise the entire system. In this specific instance the attacker is able to cause a time delay in the server response, which is an indication that arbitrary SQL code can be executed.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the `consulting_id` GET parameter in the `/healthcare/Admin/consulting_detail.php` URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application to exploit this issue. No prior authentication is required since this is an unauthenticated endpoint.

The provided content gives details beyond what a typical CVE description would provide, including specific vulnerable URL and the usage of `sleep()` function.
