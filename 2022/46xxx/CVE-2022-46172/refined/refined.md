Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46172:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the user context used in the `default-user-settings-flow`. Specifically, the `/api/v3/flows/instances/default-user-settings-flow/execute/` endpoint allowed authenticated users to create new user accounts through the user settings flow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Access Control:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control on the user settings flow, specifically the ability to create new user accounts. The flow was not intended to be used in such a way, but it was accessible and exploitable.
- **Circumvention of Policies:** The ability to create new accounts bypassed intended administrative or user on-boarding policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Account Proliferation:** Attackers (authenticated users) can create an arbitrary number of user accounts.
- **User Confusion:** This proliferation can lead to name and email collisions, making it harder for legitimate users to log in and for administrators to manage users.
- **Circumvention of Onboarding:** If password reset flows are enabled, it enables the circumvention of policies such as limited beta tester invites, which will allow users to create their own accounts.
- **SSO Infrastructure Issues:** The newly created accounts can impact other applications integrated within the SSO infrastructure, potentially creating security and management headaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network.
- **Specific URL:** The vulnerable endpoint is located at `/if/flow/default-user-settings-flow/` which is accessed through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user within the system. This exploit does not work if you are not logged in.
- **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited with low privileges, meaning that a user with limited permissions can perform this attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to set up and exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability only works in cases where an already authenticated user exists and is logged in, and visiting the vulnerable URL.
- The issue was fixed in authentik versions 2022.11.4, 2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0
