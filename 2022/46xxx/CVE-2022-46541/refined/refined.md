Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `httpd` module of the Tenda F1203 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when handling the `ssid` parameter in a POST request to `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set`. The code doesn't properly validate the length of the `ssid` parameter, allowing an attacker to provide an overly long string that overflows the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that sending an overly long `ssid` parameter can cause a denial of service. While the document only mentions DoS, it's possible that with further analysis, the vulnerability could be leveraged for other impacts such as remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set`. The vulnerable parameter is `ssid`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This likely means being on the same network as the router or having network access to it.
*  **Knowledge of the target:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable URL and parameter.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided github page contains a specific Proof of Concept with the overly long "ssid" parameter that results in a DoS of the Tenda F1203 router.
* The specific version of the firmware affected is  Tenda F1203 V2.0.1.6.
