- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the web UI of IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD), allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code into the UCD Web UI. This could alter the intended functionality and potentially lead to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI of UCD where an attacker can inject JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the UCD Web UI and inject the malicious code. This could potentially be through a compromised account, or by exploiting a feature that allows user input that is not properly sanitized.
