- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `datax-web` executor RPC interface uses the Hessian protocol directly for serialization without proper permission checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated deserialization vulnerability. The application directly deserializes data without any privilege checks, allowing an attacker to send malicious serialized data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution. By sending a crafted Hessian payload, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the executor's RPC interface. Specifically, the attacker sends a POST request to the RPC endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `datax-web` executor RPC interface (default port 9999), and must be able to craft a malicious Hessian payload.
