Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in a database stored function within TrueConf Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability within a stored function in the PostgreSQL database used by TrueConf Server. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the TrueConf Server.
- Privilege Escalation: A low-privileged database user can gain the privileges of the database administrator, leading to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the vulnerable database stored function within the TrueConf Server application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the PostgreSQL database to exploit this vulnerability. It is implied that the attacker needs access to the database as a low-privileged user.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects TrueConf Server version 5.2.0.10225.
- It was discovered by Andrey Sitnikov, Sergey Gerasimov, and George Noseevich of SolidLab LLC.
- The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor, TrueConf LLC.
- A fix was implemented in TrueConf Server version 5.2.6 and later.
