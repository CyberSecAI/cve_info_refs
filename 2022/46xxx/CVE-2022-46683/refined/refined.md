**CVE-2022-46683**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Google Login plugin improperly determines that a redirect URL after login is legitimately pointing to Jenkins.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can perform phishing attacks by redirecting users to a different site after successful authentication on a Jenkins URL.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious Jenkins URL that, after successful authentication, will redirect the user to an attacker-controlled site.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. No special position or access is required, as the user is the one that triggers the vulnerability through a crafted URL.
