Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of the `name` parameter in the Online Graduate Tracer System v1.0.0. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    - **Website defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the website.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or triggering downloads.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted payload:** The attacker creates a malicious script (payload) and injects it into the `name` parameter.
- **Local Attack:** The attack is described as "Local," likely meaning the attacker would have to have some means to get the user to execute the malicious payload, such as through social engineering or some other method. The impact would be on any user that executes the payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the `name` parameter of the application. This could be achieved by:
   - Crafting a malicious URL with the payload within the name parameter, then tricking a user into visiting that URL.
    - Directly submitting a form containing the malicious payload if this functionality is accessible to them.
    - Exploiting another vulnerability in the application to manipulate the name field.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the "Online Graduate Tracer System - V 1.0.0" according to the content
- The vulnerable component is identified as "name=".
- The discoverer of the vulnerability is Rajeshwar Singh.
