- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `FileUtils.java` in MeterSphere does not validate the file path provided during file upload, allowing a malicious user to specify an arbitrary file path, leading to path injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path injection vulnerability due to lack of file path validation in the `FileUtils.java` class.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could upload a file to an arbitrary location on the server's filesystem, potentially overwriting existing files or introducing malicious content.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, by sending a malicious file upload request with a crafted file path to the vulnerable MeterSphere instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a high privilege to perform file upload actions, and the user interaction is required for exploitation.
