The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Helmet Store Showroom Site v1.0" application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/hss/admin/?page=products/view_product` endpoint before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Database information leakage: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as the database name (shown in the provided example).
*   Potentially, an attacker could also modify or delete data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which is accessible over the network.
*   No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
