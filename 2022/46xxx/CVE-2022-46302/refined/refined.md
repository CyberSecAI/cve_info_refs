- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The system Apache, which runs with root privileges, reads a reverse proxy configuration provided by site users. This allows a malicious site user to craft a configuration that would cause the system Apache to execute arbitrary code as root.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege management, specifically allowing user-controlled data to influence the configuration of a privileged process (system Apache).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A site user can achieve local privilege escalation and execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the system. This can lead to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious site user can manipulate the reverse proxy configuration for their site to execute arbitrary code through the system Apache process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a site user with the ability to modify the site's Apache configuration, although not directly, by manipulating the source of the configuration used by the system Apache.
