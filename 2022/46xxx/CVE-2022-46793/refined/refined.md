{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request and trick a logged-in user into executing it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into performing an action (e.g., by clicking a link or loading a malicious website). The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated."
