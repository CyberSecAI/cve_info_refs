# XSS vulnerability in the application image file upload

Moderate

[jmattheis](/jmattheis)
published
GHSA-xv6x-456v-24xh
Dec 29, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/gotify/server
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=2.2.1

## Patched versions

2.2.2

## Description

### Impact

The XSS vulnerability allows authenticated users to upload .html files. With that, an attacker could execute client side scripts **if** another user opened a link, such as:

```
https://push.example.org/image/[alphanumeric string].html

```

An attacker could potentially take over the account of the user that clicked the link. Keep in mind, the Gotify UI won't natively expose such a malicious link, so an attacker has to get the user to open the malicious link in a context outside of Gotify.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.2.2.

### Workarounds

You can block access to non image files via a reverse proxy in the `./image` directory.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @jmattheis **[jmattheis](/jmattheis)** commented [Dec 28, 2022](#issue-1513097157)

The application image file upload allowed authenticated users to upload malious .html files. Opening such a file like

<https://push.gotify.net/image/ViaxrjzNowdgL-xnEfVV-Ggv5.html>

would allow the attacker to execute client side scripts.

The application image upload will now only allow the upload of files

with the following extensions: .gif, .png, .jpg and .jpeg.

Sorry, something went wrong.
