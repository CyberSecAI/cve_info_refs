Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the application's image file upload functionality not properly validating file types, allowing authenticated users to upload arbitrary files, including malicious HTML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The application did not restrict the types of files that could be uploaded, which allowed users to upload files with extensions other than image formats.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to upload HTML files enabled XSS attacks since the server served the uploaded files under the `/image` path without sanitization, allowing execution of client-side scripts when the file was accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Client-Side Script Execution:** An attacker could upload malicious HTML files containing JavaScript code. If another user opens a link to this file (e.g., `https://push.example.org/image/[alphanumeric string].html`), the attacker's script would execute in the victim's browser.
-   **Potential Account Takeover:** Through the XSS vulnerability, an attacker could potentially steal cookies or other sensitive information to take over the account of a user that opened the malicious link. The attacker needs to get the victim to click the malicious link outside the Gotify UI.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network through a link.
-   **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious HTML file to the server using the image file upload feature.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening a URL to the uploaded malicious HTML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to use the image upload feature.
-   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to find a way to get another user to open the malicious link, as the Gotify UI won't natively expose it.

**Additional Details:**

-   **Affected Versions:** Versions of `github.com/gotify/server` up to and including 2.2.1 are affected.
-   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.2.
-   **Mitigation:** The fix involves restricting file uploads to only allow image file extensions (e.g., .gif, .png, .jpg, .jpeg) and preventing the serving of non-image files from the `/image` directory.
-   **Workaround:** Access to non-image files in the `./image` directory can be blocked using a reverse proxy.
-   The vulnerability was reported by `rickshang (aka 无在无不在)`.
-   The CVSS score is 4.6, classified as Moderate, with a base score of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.
