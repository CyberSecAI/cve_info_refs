- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that are normally reserved for higher-privileged users. Specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors**: Not specified, but it's implied to be through a function that lacks proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber (least privileged role).
