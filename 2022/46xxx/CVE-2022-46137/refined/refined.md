- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Failure to normalize the URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files in the root directory of the website, including configuration files or other website files.
- **Attack vectors:** By accessing any interface of Folder Path (e.g., "/includes", "/images", "/js", "/fonts", "css", "/admin" and "/admin/*") and concatenating multiple "../" sequences in the URL, an attacker can traverse the directory structure.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server, and manipulate the URL to include directory traversal sequences.
