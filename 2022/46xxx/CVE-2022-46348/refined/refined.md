Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-46348:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted X_B files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write:** The software writes data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially achieve **remote code execution** in the context of the current process. This means the attacker could run arbitrary code on the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local, triggered by opening a specially crafted X_B file.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a malicious X_B file format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious X_B file with the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).
*   User interaction is required (UI:R), as the user needs to open the file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Parasolid and Solid Edge products.
*   The vulnerability was reported by the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI-CAN-19383).
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score for this vulnerability is 7.8, indicating a high severity.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a local attack (AV:L), low complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), user interaction required (UI:R) and no scope change (S:U) with high confidentiality, integrity and availability impact (C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   Exploit is proven (E:P)
*   The vulnerability is considered as unconfirmed (RL:O)
*   Report Confidence is confirmed (RC:C)
