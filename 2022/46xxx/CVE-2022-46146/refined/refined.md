Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46146:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a predictable cache key generation in the basic authentication implementation of the Prometheus exporter toolkit. The cache, designed to improve performance by storing authentication results, used the concatenation of username, hashed password, and input password (hex encoded) as the key. This allowed an attacker with knowledge of the hashed password to poison the cache.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Predictable cache key:** The cache key was generated by concatenating the hex-encoded username, hashed password, and input password making it predictable and vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Caching of unsuccessful attempts:** The cache stored both successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts, including attempts using a "fakepassword" for non-existent users, making it susceptible to poisoning.
*  **Storing plaintext password-derived material:** The cache was indexed using password-derived material, increasing the password's susceptibility to timing attacks.
*   **Insecure caching mechanism:** Storing plaintext passwords in memory for an extended period, even with bcrypt being used for authentication, defeats the purpose of password hashing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Authentication bypass:** An attacker can bypass basic authentication by poisoning the cache with a forged request using the valid hashed password, allowing unauthorized access to the exporter's metrics.
*   **Access to sensitive data:** Successful exploitation grants access to potentially sensitive information exposed by the Prometheus exporter, impacting the confidentiality of metrics data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out via network requests to the vulnerable exporter.
*   **Cache poisoning:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to poison the authentication cache.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Knowledge of hashed password:** The attacker needs to have access to the bcrypted password hash of a legitimate user, typically stored in a web.yml file, to create the malicious authentication attempt.
*  **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable exporter endpoint.
*   **No prior authentication required:** The attacker does not need to have a valid user account, just knowledge of the hash.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fix involves hex-encoding each component (username, hashed password, and input password) separately and joining them with colons, which prevents the concatenation vulnerability and also ensures that the cache no longer records successful authentications for non-existing users using "fakepassword".
* While caching significantly improves performance it introduces new risks like potential timing attacks against passwords.
* The vulnerability affects the exporter toolkit which is a dependency used by many Prometheus exporters.
* The vulnerability can be exploited locally with the appropriate CVSS vector, as seen in the GitHub Security Advisory.
* Multiple vendors released security updates after the public disclosure of the vulnerability.
