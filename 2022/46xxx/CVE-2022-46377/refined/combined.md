## Description

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the PORT command parameter extraction functionality of Weston Embedded uC-FTPs v 1.98.00. A specially-crafted set of network packets can lead to denial of service. An attacker can send packets to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability occurs when no IP address argument is provided to the `PORT` command.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1681

## Weston Embedded uC-FTPs PORT command parameter extraction out-of-bounds read vulnerability

##### May 10, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-46377,CVE-2022-46378

##### SUMMARY

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the PORT command parameter extraction functionality of Weston Embedded uC-FTPs v 1.98.00. A specially-crafted set of network packets can lead to denial of service. An attacker can send packets to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Weston Embedded uC-FTPs v 1.98.00

##### PRODUCT URLS

uC-FTPs - <https://weston-embedded.com/micrium/overview>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

6.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-823 - Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset

##### DETAILS

uC-FTPs is Micrium’s FTP server. It is designed to be used on embedded systems running the µC/OS-II or µC/OS-III RTOS kernels. This FTP server implements part of the following RFCs: RFC 959, RFC 2389, Draft IETF.

When an authenticated user sends the `PORT` command to uC-FTPs with no arguments, the server attempts to find an ascii digit within the network buffer when extracting the ip address argument and the port argument. If no ascii digit is found, it will infinitely increment the pointer until the pointer accesses unmapped memory. This bug results in a denial of service in any case where unmapped memory is accessed prior to an ascii digit being read from memory.

#### CVE-2022-46377 - IP address parsing

The portion of the code responsible for extracting the IP address from the `PORT` command expects to find an ascii digit within the network buffer.

```
for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++) {
                    dig = ASCII_IsDig(*ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs);
                    while ((dig == DEF_NO) && (ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs != (CPU_CHAR *)0)) {
                        ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs++;
                        dig = ASCII_IsDig(*ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs);
                    }
                    p_addr[i] = Str_ParseNbr_Int32U(ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs, &ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs, 10);
                }

```

```
#### Mitigation

The while loop responsible for incrementing the `ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs` should also terminate in the case where a `NULL` byte is read from the network buffer. The network buffer is guaranteed to contain a `NULL` byte because the caller `FTPs_CtrlTask` explicitly places one at the end of received network data. Example bugfix below:

```
for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++) {
                    dig = ASCII_IsDig(*ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs);
                    while ((dig == DEF_NO) && (ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs != (CPU_CHAR *)0) && (*ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs != 0)) {
                        ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs++;
                        dig = ASCII_IsDig(*ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs);
                    }
                    p_addr[i] = Str_ParseNbr_Int32U(ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs, &ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs, 10);
                }

```
#### CVE-2022-46378 - Port parsing

The portion of the code responsible for extracting the port number from the `PORT` command expects to find an ascii digit within the network buffer.

```
for (i = 0; i <= 1; i++) {
                    dig = ASCII_IsDig(*ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs);
                    while ((dig == DEF_NO) && (ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs != 0)) {
                        ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs++;
                        dig = ASCII_IsDig(*ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs);
                    }
                    p_port[i] = Str_ParseNbr_Int32U(ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs, &ftp_session->CtrlCmdArgs, 10);
