**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-46973

**Product:** report

**Version:** 0.9.8.6

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Root Cause:** The `report` application version 0.9.8.6 is vulnerable to arbitrary SSRF, as detailed in the linked issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The application allows an attacker to control the server's requests to other systems/servers, which results in the SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker can potentially interact with internal services, which are not exposed to the outside world.
   - An attacker can perform port scans on the internal network.
   - An attacker can read files from the internal network.
   - The vulnerability might be exploited to gain initial access to the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - An attacker crafts malicious requests that force the server to make requests to an arbitrary URL under the attacker's control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `report` application, implying the application needs to be network accessible.
   - The attacker needs to be able to influence the parameters of the request to control the URL the server will make requests to.
