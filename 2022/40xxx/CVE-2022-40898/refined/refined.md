{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a vulnerable regular expression used to verify the validity of Wheel file names within the `wheel` package.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a maliciously crafted wheel file or by using the Wheel CLI with a specially crafted filename which causes the vulnerable regex to consume excessive resources during parsing.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Use of the `wheel` package as a library",
      "Use of the Wheel Command Line Interface (CLI)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious file to the wheel library, or control the input file to the `wheel` CLI. No specific privileges are required.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present when parsing a maliciously crafted Wheel file. The `wheel` package's maintainers have acknowledged the issue and have released a patched version 0.38.0.  The `bdist_wheel` extension for setuptools is not vulnerable as sanitization is performed on parts of the payload string."
