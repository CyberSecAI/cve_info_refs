- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper initialization of a pointer before it's accessed during the parsing of X_B files in Ansys SpaceClaim.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uninitialized pointer usage leading to potential memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (Ansys SpaceClaim).
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious X_B file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious X_B file or a malicious page that triggers the parsing flaw within Ansys SpaceClaim.
