How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

  Poll â Archive

## FAQ

### General Usage (Without Widget)

```
<?php if ( function_exists( 'vote_poll' ) && ! in_pollarchive() ): ?>
    <li>
        <h2>Polls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><?php get_poll();?></li>
        </ul>
        <?php display_polls_archive_link(); ?>
    </li>
<?php endif; ?>

```

* To show specific poll, use `<?php get_poll(2); ?>` where 2 is your poll id.
* To show random poll, use `<?php get_poll(-2); ?>`
* To embed a specific poll in your post, use `[poll id="2"]` where 2 is your poll id.
* To embed a random poll in your post, use `[poll id="-2"]`
* To embed a specific pollâs result in your post, use `[poll id="2" type="result"]` where 2 is your poll id.

### General Usage (With Widget)

1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Appearance -> Widgets`.
2. You can add the Polls Widget by clicking on the âAddâ link besides it.
3. After adding, you can configure the Polls Widget by clicking on the âEditâ link besides it.
4. Click âSave Changesâ.
5. Scroll down for instructions on how to create a Polls Archive.

### How To Add A Polls Archive?

1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Pages -> Add New`.
2. Type any title you like in the postâs title area.
3. If you ARE using nice permalinks, after typing the title, WordPress will generate the permalink to the page. You will see an âEditâ link just beside the permalink.
4. Click âEditâ and type in `pollsarchive` in the text field and click âSaveâ.
5. Type `[page_polls]` in the postâs content area.
6. Click âPublishâ.

* If you ARE NOT using nice permalinks, you need to go to `WP-Admin -> Polls -> Poll Options` and under `Poll Archive -> Polls Archive URL`, you need to fill in the URL to the Polls Archive Page you created above.

### Why doesnât my pollâs answers add up to 100%?

* It is because of rounding issues. To make it always round up to 100%, the last pollâs answer will get the remainding percentage added to it. To enable this feature, add this to your themeâs functions.php: `add_filter( 'wp_polls_round_percentage', '__return_true' );`

### How Does WP-Polls Load CSS?

* WP-Polls will load `polls-css.css` from your themeâs directory if it exists.
* If it doesnât exists, it will just load the default `polls-css.css` that comes with WP-Polls.
* This will allow you to upgrade WP-Polls without worrying about overwriting your polls styles that you have created.

### Why In Internet Explorer (IE) The pollâs Text Appear Jagged?

* To solve this issue, Open poll-css.css
* Find: `/* background-color: #ffffff; */`
* Replace: `background-color: #ffffff;` (where #ffffff should be your background color for the poll.)

### How Do I Have Individual Colors For Each Pollâs Bar?

* Courtesy Of [TreedBox.com](http://treedbox.com "TreedBox.com")
* Open poll-css.css
* Add to the end of the file:

```
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(01) .pollbar{ background:#8FA0C5}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(02) .pollbar{ background:#FF8}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(03) .pollbar{ background:#ff8a3b}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(04) .pollbar{ background:#a61e2a}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(05) .pollbar{ background:#4ebbff}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(06) .pollbar{ background:#fbca54}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(07) .pollbar{ background:#aad34f}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(08) .pollbar{ background:#66cc9a}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(09) .pollbar{ background:#98CBCB}
.wp-polls-ul li:nth-child(10) .pollbar{ background:#a67c52}
.wp-polls-ul li .pollbar{ transition: background 0.7s ease-in-out }
.wp-polls-ul li .pollbar:hover{ background:#F00 }

```

### To Display Total Polls

```
<?php if ( function_exists( 'get_pollquestions' ) ): ?>
    <?php get_pollquestions(); ?>
<?php endif; ?>

```

### To Display Total Poll Answers

```
<?php if ( function_exists( 'get_pollanswers' ) ): ?>
    <?php get_pollanswers(); ?>
<?php endif; ?>

```

### To Display Total Poll Votes

```
<?php if ( function_exists( 'get_pollvotes' ) ): ?>
    <?php get_pollvotes(); ?>
<?php endif; ?>

```

### To Display Poll Votes by ID

```
<?php if ( function_exists( 'get_pollvotes_by_id' ) ): ?>
    <?php get_pollvotes_by_id($poll_id); ?>
<?php endif; ?>

```

### To Display Total Poll Voters

```
<?php if ( function_exists( 'get_pollvoters' ) ): ?>
    <?php get_pollvoters(); ?>
<?php endif; ?>

```

### To Display Poll Time by ID and date format

```
<?php if ( function_exists( 'get_polltime' ) ): ?>
    <?php get_polltime( $poll_id, $date_format ); ?>
<?php endif; ?>

```

### Translating the template

The plugin templates can be translated via template variables.

There are these filters for the custom template variables

```
wp_polls_template_votebody_variables
wp_polls_template_votefooter
wp_polls_template_resultheader_variables
wp_polls_template_resultbody_variables
wp_polls_template_resultfooter_variables

```

Add filter to your theme and register custom variable where you will add your translation.

Good practice is to name them for example with prefix `STR_` in the example `STR_TOTAL_VOTERS`.

```
    /**
     * Localize wp_polls_template_resultfooter_variables.
     *
     * @param array $variables An array of template variables.
     * @return array $variables Modified template variables.
     */
    function wp_polls_template_resultfooter_variables( $variables ) {

        // Add strings.
        $variables['%STR_TOTAL_VOTERS%'] = __( 'Total voters', 'theme-textdomain' );

        return $variables;
    }

// Trigger the filter
add_filter( 'wp_polls_template_resultfooter_variables', 'wp_polls_template_resultfooter_variables' , 10, 1 );

```

In the admin side just call the custom variable like so and the variable has been translated in the front-end.

%STR\_TOTAL\_VOTERS%â

For the ones who know something about HTML and CSS syntax, this plugin is perfect! It does exactly what is needed regarding polls, while the looks can be fully customized. IMHO, a brilliant piece of work!

### [Used for long time, now got a problem](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/used-for-long-time-now-got-a-problem/)

[Dani](https://profiles.wordpress.org/daniw42/ "Posts by Dani")
April 29, 2023

Hi there,
Iâve been using this plugin and loved it for its simplicity alongside with the ability to customize the look and feel.
Somehow, at some point, the admin interface changed and I am now able to see the answers of all users. Before, I was only able to see how many users voted for each answer, not who. This is a major problem for me.
Is there any way to hide the usernames from the answers given? I need to see which users voted, but not what answer they gave. The answers should only be seen as a total for each option.
Thanks

Love the feature set, easy to use, great to work with, but it fails with my cache setup (standard Cloudflare) setup.
Have to remove it a site and move to another solution, sadly this was after my install, setting up on my custom post types, etc.
Would love to see it updated in the future.
