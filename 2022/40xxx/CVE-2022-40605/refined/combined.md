## What's Changed

### Bug Patches

* Fixed "Save + Add" button on "Add Ability" modal in adversaries page so it doesn't result in an error. [#2637](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2637)
* Fixed a first-time startup error in the Atomic plugin resulting from a loop when parsing atomic abilities. [#2657](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2657)
* Fixed a bug in the Training plugin preventing the first manx flag from completing. [#2638](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2638)
* Fixed "(unexpected keyword argument 'loop')" error from the start\_server call. [#2625](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2625)

### Security Fixes

* Patched a XSS bug found in the Operations tab and Debrief plugin that took advantage of unsanitized input in an operation's name field. [#2644](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2644)
  + Disclosure reports coming soon, stay tuned
  + Credit to Jayson Grace from Meta's Purple Team for discovering this vulnerability

### Operations Page

* Added "Operations Detail" modal on operation page that shows how the operation was configured at its start. [#2558](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2558)
* Tidied up row of buttons so they align better. [#2615](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2615)

### Adversaries

(New!) "Everything Bagel" adversary: A collection of all CALDERA abilities ordered by ATT&CK tactic. Particularly useful when using the new advanced planners (see below) and want all abilities at the disposal of the planner.

(In progress) Added a missing ability to the "Worm" Adversary in the Stockpile plugin.

### Planners

(New!) Look-Ahead Planner: A CALDERA planner that decides which abilities to execute based on expected future reward.

(New!) Guided Planner: A CALDERA planner which makes use of "distance to goals" in a dependency graph to select the optimal next action.
