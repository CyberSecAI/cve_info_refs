I had an issue of the plug-in icon not showing up on Gutenburg. Once I contacted them, I was amazed how quick they notified me that they’d updated the plug-in. They endeavored several times to fix the issue until they managed to solve it.And I love how flexible and precise the plug-in works to my taste!!

Even though the site clearly states “You’re covered by our 7 days money back guarantee” and I requested a refund 1 hour after I realized this plugin would not suit my needs. My refund request was denied. Apparently they only offer refunds if the plugin is broken and they can’t fix it. As a developer, I will not be doing business with this company again.

You have to purchase pro version if you want to show star rating. For me, this makes it a non-starter.
