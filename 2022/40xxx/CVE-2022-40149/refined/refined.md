    "description": "Those using Jettison to parse untrusted XML or JSON data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by stackoverflow. This effect may support a denial of service attack.",
    "root_cause": "Parsing untrusted XML or JSON data with Jettison can lead to a stack overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-121",

    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to stack overflow, potentially crashing the parser.",
    "attack_vector": "Network.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker provides crafted XML or JSON input to the parser. Low privileges are required.",
     "more_info": "The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing by Jazzer, and was fixed in version 1.5.1. The stackoverflow occurs due to specially crafted input, causing excessive recursion."
