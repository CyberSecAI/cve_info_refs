# [BRLY-2022-014] Arbitrary write vulnerability in PEI module leads to arbitrary code execution during PEI phase.

August 10, 2022Severity:HighCVSS Score7.2Public Disclosure Date:August 10, 2022CVE ID:

[CVE-2022-32579](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32579)
[CVE-2022-40246](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40246)

## Summary

Binarly REsearch Team has discovered a arbitrary write vulnerability in PEI module allowing a possible attacker to execute arbitrary code during PEI phase.![Vendors Affected Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65d392ca924b59f0fcd873eb/6698dd226326f191c074ad7b_Vendors.svg)
### Vendors Affected

Intel[Intel](/advisory-vendor/intel),![Affected Products icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65d392ca924b59f0fcd873eb/6698dd3fad8b6d927d1b45c4_Affected%20products.svg)
### Affected Products

Intel NUC M15 BCTGL357 v0072 (Latest)
## Potential Impact

A potential attacker can write one byte by arbitrary address at the time of the PEI phase (only during S3 resume boot mode) and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to the mitigations bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory.

## Summary

**Binarly REsearch Team** has discovered a arbitrary write vulnerability in PEI module allowing a possible attacker to execute arbitrary code during PEI phase.

## Affected Intel firmwares with confirmed impact by Binarly REsearch Team

| Device/Firmware | File Name | SHA256 (File PE32 section) | File GUID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intel NUC M15 BCTGL357 v0072 (Latest) | SbPei | d827182e5f9b7a9ff0b9d3e232f7cfac43b5237e2681e11f005be627a49283a9 | c1fbd624-27ea-40d1-aa48-94c3dc5c7e0d |

## Potential impact

A potential attacker can write one byte by arbitrary address at the time of the PEI phase (only during S3 resume boot mode) and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to the mitigasions bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory.

## Vulnerability description

The pseudocode for vulnerable function is shown below.

* function address: `0xFFAC3E32`
* this function is notifier for `EFI_PEI_END_OF_PEI_PHASE_PPI`

```
int __cdecl EfiPeiEndOfPeiPhaseNotifier(EFI_PEI_SERVICES **PeiServices)
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  if ( ((*PeiServices)->GetBootMode(PeiServices, &BootMode) & 0x80000000) == 0
    && BootMode == BOOT_ON_S3_RESUME
    && ((*PeiServices)->LocatePpi(PeiServices, &EFI_PEI_READ_ONLY_VARIABLE2_PPI_GUID, 0, 0, &Ppi) & 0x80000000) == 0 )
  {
    DataSize = 4;
    if ( (Ppi->GetVariable(Ppi, L"AmiCspGlobalNvsPtrVar", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, &Data) & 0x80000000) == 0 )
    {
      Ptr = Data;
      PcdPpi = LocatePcdPpi();
      *Ptr = PcdPpi->Get8(0xF2);
    }
  }
  __outbyte(0x43, 0x54);
  __outbyte(0x41, 0x12);
  return 0;
}
```

As we can see from the pseudocode, in the case of `BOOT_ON_S3_RESUME` boot mode, the PCD byte for tocken number `0xF2` will be written by address specified in the NVRAM variable `AmiCspGlobalNvsPtrVar`.

Potencial attacker can overwrite the value of the NVRAM variable `AmiCspGlobalNvsPtrVar` thereby controlling the address at which the fixed byte will be written (on the tested platform, `PcdPpi->Get8(0xF2)` will return `0x01`).

The value of the `AmiCspGlobalNvsPtrVar` variable is set in the `AmiCspGlobalNvsDxe` (file GUID: `5bd4977a-580f-4f1a-b3c2-5198e6dcbeea`) DXE driver with attributes `EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE | EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS`.This happens during the main boot, so before entering S3 mode, the attacker cannot change the value of the `AmiCspGlobalNvsDxe` variable programmatically.

However, attacker able to rewrite NVRAM region on SPI flash with programmer:

* this can be done while sleeping (it is enough to change the value of the variable and not change the attributes of the variable)
* this can be done while with the device turned off (in this case, the `EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS` attribute must be present)

## Exploitation steps

This vulnerability has been tested on the Windows 10 operating system.

Below are the steps to reproduce.

* Make sure that the operating system supports the S3 sleep mode (`powercfg /a`)
* If the `S0 Low Power Idle` mode is enabled instead of `S3`, you need to create the following registry value:

| Subkey | Value Name | Value Type | Value Data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power` | `PlatformAoAcOverride` | `REG_DWORD` | `0` |

* Sleep
* Change the NVRAM variable `AmiCspGlobalNvsPtrVar` value by hardware overwriting the SPI flash memory
* the new value is a pointer that you need to rewrite at the end of PEI phase
* Wake up

    - #### AMI FirST Builds a Platform of Trust

      The supply chain is a significant cybersecurity threat for mission-critical servers in modern data centers or enterprises. Before a device leaves the manufacturing site, it’s crucial for the original design manufacturers (ODMs), OEMs and firmware suppliers to work together to ensure the firmware is attested. At AMI, we are committed to helping maintain firmware integrity throughout the supply chain.

    - #### Zero Trust Security Starts with Firmware

      Zero Trust security is essential for protecting an organization’s infrastructure and business critical data in today’s digital transformation. But without secure firmware running on the infrastructure, Zero Trust strategy weakens significantly.

      From your car to airport kiosks and power grids, nearly all technology is powered by firmware and for that reason, firmware attacks are on the rise. Firmware attacks are much more dangerous than OS-based attacks because firmware is invisible to OS-based security solutions.

      AMI’s Zero Trust firmware security solutions can help maintain firmware integrity and strengthen organizations’ Zero trust strategy.

    - #### Empower Your Arm Devices With AMI Foundational Firmware

      As an Arm license partner, one of your main objectives is to bring your designs to the market as quickly and efficiently as possible. However, this process can be fraught with challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles you may encounter is in the development of firmware. Firmware is a critical component of your device, ensuring that it powers on, runs securely, and stays on during its lifecycle. Developing firmware that meets these requirements can be a complex and time-consuming task, but it is essential for the success of your device.

## Encryption Key for Secure Data Transmission

AMI recommends that you encrypt sensitive information to protect it from being viewed by unintended recipients. AMI can exchange emails with you using encryption. AMI highly suggests that you encrypt and decrypt email communications between AMI and yourself using an email client that supports encryption.

It is good security practice that you only trust ***validated encryption keys***. Do not trust encryption keys that have not been validated. It is important to also validate your copy of the AMI public encryption key to ensure it is legitimate.
