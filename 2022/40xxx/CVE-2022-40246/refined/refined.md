Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `EfiPeiEndOfPeiPhaseNotifier` function in the PEI module. This function is triggered at the end of the PEI phase during an S3 resume boot. It reads a byte from a PCD (Platform Configuration Database) token `0xF2` and writes this byte to an address retrieved from the NVRAM variable `AmiCspGlobalNvsPtrVar`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary Write:** The core issue is an arbitrary one-byte write. The address where the byte is written is taken from the NVRAM variable `AmiCspGlobalNvsPtrVar`, which can be manipulated by an attacker. The data written is a fixed byte read from PCD token 0xF2 which, in the tested environment, was 0x01.
- **NVRAM Manipulation:** Although the `AmiCspGlobalNvsPtrVar` variable is set in the `AmiCspGlobalNvsDxe` driver during normal boot and has `EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE | EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS` attributes (which prevents programmatic change by the attacker in runtime), it can be modified by directly writing to the SPI flash where the NVRAM is stored by hardware means.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the write address, an attacker can overwrite critical data structures in memory during the PEI phase, allowing for arbitrary code execution in subsequent boot stages.
- **Mitigation Bypassing:** The vulnerability can be used to bypass security mitigations in place.
- **Memory Disclosure:** Exploitation could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from physical memory.
- **VM Compromise:**  Secrets from Virtual Machines (VMs) can be accessed, potentially breaking isolation between VMs.
- **SMRAM Injection:** An attacker can potentially inject a payload into SMRAM memory.
- **Confidential Computing Boundary Bypass:** Memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries can be bypassed, which is a critical security failure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the device to modify the SPI flash memory where NVRAM resides by hardware means.
- **S3 Resume Boot Mode:** The vulnerability is triggered during S3 resume (sleep) boot mode, meaning that the system needs to enter the S3 sleep state and then resume to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Hardware Access:** Attacker needs physical access to the target machine and the ability to rewrite the SPI flash memory containing NVRAM. This can be achieved with a hardware programmer.
- **Knowledge of NVRAM structure:** The attacker needs to know which NVRAM variable to modify and understand where to write the desired address to in SPI flash memory.
- **S3 Sleep Trigger:** The attacker must be able to make the system enter S3 sleep and then resume.
- **Payload Development:** To achieve a full compromise, the attacker will need to create a payload, which can be code or a pointer to code to be executed, and inject this into memory by means of this arbitrary write primitive.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by the Binarly REsearch Team.
- It affects Intel firmware, specifically Intel NUC M15 BCTGL357 v0072 (latest).
- It has been assigned CVE-2022-32579 by Intel PSIRT and CVE-2022-40246 by AMI PSIRT.
- A CVSS v3.1 score of 7.2 (High) is assigned to the vulnerability: AV:P/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `EfiPeiEndOfPeiPhaseNotifier` function (address 0xFFAC3E32).
- The vulnerable code path is taken when the system resumes from S3 sleep mode and the `EFI_PEI_READ_ONLY_VARIABLE2_PPI_GUID` is found.
- The byte written is retrieved using `PcdPpi->Get8(0xF2)`.
- The disclosure timeline indicates that Intel was notified on 2022-05-04 and a patch was released on 2022-08-01. Binarly publicly disclosed the issue on 2022-08-10.
- A FwHunt rule `BRLY-2022-014` has been created for detecting this vulnerability.
