Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `loginValidation.php` file of the Simple Task Managing System.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied inputs (`login` and `password` parameters) before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where unsanitized user inputs are directly incorporated into SQL queries. This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL query structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials and project information.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database, potentially disrupting the application's functionality.
*   **Application Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server, depending on the attacker's capabilities and the server configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `loginValidation.php` file.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The `login` and `password` parameters within the POST request are susceptible to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Attackers need basic knowledge of HTTP requests (specifically POST requests) and how to manipulate them.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** Attackers need to be familiar with SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, so attackers don't need prior access to the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided GitHub repository contains proof-of-concept exploit code and examples of how to exploit the vulnerability using `sqlmap`.
*   The exploit-db page ([https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51273](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51273)) and packetstormsecurity.com entry ([https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171739/Simple-Task-Managing-System-1.0-SQL-Injection.html](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171739/Simple-Task-Managing-System-1.0-SQL-Injection.html)) also describe this SQL Injection.
