{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of X_T files due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data, leading to a write past the end of an allocated data structure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability during the parsing of X_T files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious X_T file that, when parsed by the affected software, triggers the out-of-bounds write. The target must open this malicious file, or visit a malicious webpage that forces the software to parse such files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted X_T file to a user of the vulnerable software, or induce the target to visit a page which triggers parsing of a malicious X_T file. User interaction is required as the target must open the file or visit a malicious page."
