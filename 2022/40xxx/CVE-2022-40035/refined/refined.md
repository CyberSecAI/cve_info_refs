{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types through the `/uploadFileList` endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Lack of file type validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload a malicious file (e.g., a JSP webshell) to execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The attacker first registers an account and logs in.",
    "Navigates to the file management section.",
    "Uploads a crafted JSP file containing malicious code to the `/uploadFileList` endpoint.",
     "Accesses the uploaded JSP file via `/upload/file/text.jsp` which executes the malicious code."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Attacker needs to register an account and have access to the application's web interface.",
    "Ability to craft and upload malicious files (e.g. webshell)."
  ]
