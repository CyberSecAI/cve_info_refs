Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-40839:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) and description of a SQL injection vulnerability targeting the NdkAdvancedCustomizationFields Prestashop module, which is the subject of CVE-2022-40839. The information confirms that the vulnerability exists in module versions up to 3.5.0.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `front_ajax.php` file of the NdkAdvancedCustomizationFields module. Specifically, the `width` and `height` parameters used in the `getRangePrice` action are not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries through the vulnerable parameters.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to potentially extract sensitive data from the database (customer information, product data, etc.).
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:** By using SQL injection to execute resource-intensive queries, an attacker can potentially slow down or crash the server.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:**  In some cases, a successful SQL injection can lead to further compromise by gaining access to the operating system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `front_ajax.php` file, using the vulnerable parameters.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Prestashop instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The PoC demonstrates the vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `modules/ndk_advanced_custom_fields/front_ajax.php`
*   **Vulnerable Action:** `getRangePrice`
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** `width`, `height`
*   **Payload Example:** `1' AND (SELECT 6330 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))pQfS) AND 'dpZV'='dpZV`
    *   This payload injects a SQL query that causes a 5-second sleep, allowing the attacker to confirm the injection.
