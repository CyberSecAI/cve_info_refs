The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `edit_customer_action.php` file of an online banking system.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `cust_id` parameter passed via the GET method. The application directly uses this parameter within an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application. Specifically, the code uses `$_GET['cust_id']` directly in the WHERE clause of an UPDATE query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Data exfiltration: An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database by crafting specific SQL injection payloads.
    - Data modification: The attacker could modify customer records, possibly leading to unauthorized changes in account balances or personal information.
    - Authentication bypass: Through SQL injection, it might be possible to create new admin users or otherwise gain unauthorized access to privileged resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `edit_customer_action.php` where the `cust_id` parameter is maliciously crafted to include SQL injection syntax.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

The provided content also includes a proof-of-concept (POC) showing how to exploit the vulnerability using a time-based SQL injection, which indicates the vulnerability allows for arbitrary SQL execution.
