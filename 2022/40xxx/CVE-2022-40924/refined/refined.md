The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Zoo Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file upload in the "save_animal" file of the "Animals" module in the background management system. The system does not properly validate uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload a PHP file containing malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows uploading files without proper validation of file types or content.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application doesn't sanitize the uploaded file content.
- Direct access to the uploaded files: The webserver serves the uploaded files directly, allowing execution of the uploaded PHP code.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker could gain full control of the system, read sensitive information, modify data, install malware, or pivot to other systems. In this example, the attacker uploads a phpinfo() shell which displays server configuration, which could then be leveraged further.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Zoo Management System via the "save_animal" endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to access the vulnerable application via the web interface.
- The attacker must have valid administrator credentials to access the "save_animal" functionality or have bypassed authentication. The report indicates that default credentials `admin@mail.com/Password@123` are usable.
- The attacker can craft a malicious POST request to upload the file.
