Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discussed:

**Vulnerability 1: Global-buffer-overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A global buffer overflow occurs during the writing of atom data, specifically within `AP4_StdcFileByteStream::WritePartial`. The overflow happens when writing data to a global buffer, `AP4_GlobalOptions::g_Entries`, exceeding its allocated size.
*   **Weaknesses:** The code lacks proper bounds checking when writing to the global buffer, leading to a write out-of-bounds.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** This vulnerability results in a crash due to the global buffer overflow detected by AddressSanitizer (ASan). It can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited maliciously in a different context.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted MP4 file, specifically while using the `mp4split` binary. The file provided to the `mp4split` is designed to trigger the overflow.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable `mp4split` binary.

**Vulnerability 2: Segmentation Fault (SEGV)**

*   **Root Cause:** A segmentation fault occurs due to a read access to the zero page memory. This happens during the processing of a descriptor list using `AP4_DescriptorListWriter::Action`.
*   **Weaknesses:** The code attempts to read from an invalid memory location (address 0x0) during descriptor list processing.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** This vulnerability causes a crash due to a segmentation fault, which can disrupt the normal execution of the `mp4split` binary.
*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to the first vulnerability, this is triggered by processing a crafted MP4 file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MP4 file to the `mp4split` binary.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were found using a fuzzer, indicating that the fuzzer generated inputs that exposed the code's weakness.
*   The report indicates that the issues were found in version `v1.6.0-639` of Bento4 and have been fixed in later commits.
*   The provided crash files (`crash.zip`) can reproduce the issues.
*   The specific files that triggered the vulnerabilities are `id:000000,sig:06,src:000011,op:flip1,pos:31240,1216870` for the buffer overflow and `id:000001,sig:06,src:000011,op:flip1,pos:31415,1226899` for the segmentation fault.

These vulnerabilities highlight issues with memory management and handling of malformed input within the `mp4split` binary of the Bento4 library.
