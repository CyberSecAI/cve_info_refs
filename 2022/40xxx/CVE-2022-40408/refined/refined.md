The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in FeehiCMS version 2.1.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input in the comment box of the "Single Page" content module. Specifically, the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the comment section which will be executed when other users view the page, potentially leading to:
    * Session hijacking
    * Information theft
    * Defacement of the website
    * Redirection to malicious websites
    * Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
1. An attacker registers a user account.
2. The attacker navigates to "Content -> Single Page".
3. The attacker uploads an image in the comment box.
4. The attacker submits a comment.
5. The attacker intercepts the network request and modifies the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag to include a malicious payload, such as `'x' onerror='alert(1)'.
6. The modified request is sent to the server.
7. When users visit the page, the malicious JavaScript is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be a registered user.
*   The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network requests.
