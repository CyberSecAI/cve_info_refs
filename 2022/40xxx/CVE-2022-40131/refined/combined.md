## Description

A beautifully simple to set up plugin that gives site visitors and site owners the ability to quickly and easily see how many people have visited that page or post.

#### FEATURES

* On the front end it adds an icon and page views count to the bottom or top of pages and posts on your WordPress website.
* Switch ON | OFF hide Page Views Count for all Posts, Pages and all custom posts types including WooCommerce custom post types.
* Set the Position of the counter to show at the top of the page or post or at the bottom
* Set alignment of the counter Left, Right or Centre
* Set the colour and size of the counter icon
* Option to use load by Ajax to prevent the count from being cached by caching plugins
* Option to Manually set / edit total views and views today from Page View Count meta box on any post or page editor
* Add Page Views counter via the PVC Gutenberg block
* Add Page Views counter via shortcode
* Add Page Views counter via widget
* Developers can add the Page Views Counter via php tag
* All options and settings are point click – absolutely no coding required

#### COMPATIBILTY

Compatible with WordPress 5.9+ and backwards to WP 5.6.0 Compatible with Classic Editor plugin (Gutenberg editor Deactivated)

#### GUTENBERG BLOCK

Using the Gutenberg Editor. Use the Page View Count Block to add the counter to any page or post content. Block search for ‘Page Views’ or selecting the block from the a3rev Blocks menu.

Adding the Page Views block to your content automatically deactivates the Global Page View counter on the post or page.

#### ELEMENTOR TEMPLATES

Fully compatible with Elementor templates. Add counter via Shortcode or widget to any template.

#### DEVELOPERS

On the plugins dashboard in the + Page Views Count Function options box you will find the Page Views Count functions and notes on how to use them.

* Use to manually add Page views count to any content or object in the theme.
* Use to add page View Count to any content that is not create using WordPress custom post / taxonomy type.
* Use to create a custom position of the Page Views Count
* Functions support echo and return parameters when getting visitor stats on any variable.

#### TROUBLESHOOTING

* The number 1 support request we get about the plugin is that it double or triple counts page or post loads. Yes it does and if you see that it is a Red Flag that you have a misconfiguration or bug in your theme or a plugin. Page Views Count does exactly that – counts each time the page or post is loading in the browser – if its counting twice it is because the browser is double loading the page. That is a bad thing and you or your developer needs to fix that.

### [Icons on left corner](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/icons-on-left-corner-2/)

[thomytk](https://profiles.wordpress.org/thomytk/ "Posts by thomytk")
June 19, 2024

I put the counter to the footer section but on top left corner it occurs also just the statistic icon and a running icon below the statistic icon. I run the website by a purchased theme. I ask for a solution to remove the icons on the top left corner in the wordpress forum but still no answers to my question. Any suggestions?

Works great! I wish it had a way to check the stats from from dashboard instead of having to go to the post or page to check visits but still an excellent tool.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
