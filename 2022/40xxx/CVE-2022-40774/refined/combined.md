| Hi There, I tested the binary mp42ts with my fuzzer, and a crash incurred, i.e., SEGV on an unknown address error.

| This does not occur with the latest commit of the master branch. Could you double check? Sorry, we used the latest release (but not the latest commit) by mistake. Considering there are no reports and patch records corresponding to this bug, I suspect this bug might still exist. We could try to reproduce it in the latest commit version. Thanks for your time and reply. |
