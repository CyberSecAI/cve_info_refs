Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `delete_order` function within the `/pet_shop/classes/Master.php` file. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter. Specifically, the provided payload uses `updatexml` to extract the database name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive database information, including the database name, as demonstrated in the provided payload.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation/Loss:** Beyond information disclosure, successful exploitation of SQL injection can potentially lead to reading, modifying, or deleting data from the database depending on the level of access the application's database user has.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/pet_shop/classes/Master.php?f=delete_order` with the malicious SQL code injected into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests (POST), URL parameters, and basic SQL syntax to craft a working injection payload.
