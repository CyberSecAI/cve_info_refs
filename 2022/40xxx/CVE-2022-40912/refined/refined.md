- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input passed to the GET parameter 'action' is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary HTML/JS code can be executed in a user's browser session in the context of the affected site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `action` parameter. This URL is then sent to a user, and when the user opens the URL, the malicious script executes in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and convince the victim to open these URLs. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by unauthenticated users.
