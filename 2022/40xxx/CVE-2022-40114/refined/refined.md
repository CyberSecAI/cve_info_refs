The provided content is related to CVE-2022-40114.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization of the `cust_id` parameter passed through the GET method in the `edit_customer.php` file. Specifically, the code directly incorporates the unsanitized `$_GET['cust_id']` into SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerability due to the direct use of unsanitized user-supplied data in SQL queries.
- Lack of Input Validation: The code does not validate or sanitize the `cust_id` parameter before using it in the SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL query execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code that would be executed by the database, potentially leading to data breaches. This would allow the attacker to:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET parameter: The attacker can manipulate the `cust_id` parameter in a GET request to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the web application with a crafted `cust_id` parameter.
- The attacker needs no special privileges.
