**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This means they've already achieved some level of access to the system.
*   **Local Access:** The attack is launched locally from the compromised system.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability exists within the Apex One NT Listener service.
*   Trend Micro has released an update to address this issue.
