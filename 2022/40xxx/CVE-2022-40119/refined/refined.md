Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_POST['search_term']`) before it's used in an SQL query within the `net-banking/transactions.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code directly incorporates the `$_POST['search_term']` parameter into an SQL query without any form of escaping or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** A malicious actor can inject arbitrary SQL code through the `search_term` parameter, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Access sensitive data within the database (e.g., user information, transaction details).
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain control of the database server, depending on the database permissions.
*  **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection attack using the `SLEEP()` function, indicating that the attacker can infer information by observing the server's response time.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP POST request to the `net-banking/transactions.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `search_term` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*  **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter is `search_term`.
*   **No Authentication Required (implied):** The provided PoC does not seem to require prior authentication, which would allow an unauthenticated attacker to exploit this vulnerability. However, it's important to note the presence of the `cust_id` parameter which may indicate a user session or authorization check.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `net-banking/transactions.php`, specifically around line 28 and line 170.
*   The code uses PHP sessions to store search parameters (`$_SESSION['search_term']`, `$_SESSION['date_from']`, `$_SESSION['date_to']`).
*   The SQL query is built dynamically, incorporating the session data directly into the SQL statement.
*   The provided PoC uses a time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP(5)` function.
* The vulnerability is in the search functionality.
