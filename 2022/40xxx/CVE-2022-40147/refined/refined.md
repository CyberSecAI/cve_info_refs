- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper server certificate validation during TLS connection establishment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly validate the server certificate when initiating a TLS connection. This is categorized as CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can spoof a trusted entity by interfering with the communication between the Industrial Edge Management (IEM) and the Industrial Edge Hub (IEH). This allows the attacker to inject malicious maintenance requests, including sending statistics, activating remote support, exchanging initial keys during onboarding, and querying new extensions.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, specifically through interference in the communication path between IEM and IEH.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the IEM and IEH. This would allow them to present a crafted certificate. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
