SSA-649853: Improper Certiﬁcate Validation Vulnerability in Industrial
Edge Management

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.4

SUMMARY

Industrial Edge Management contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to
spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the Industrial Edge Management
(IEM) and the Industrial Edge Hub (IEH) using a crafted certiﬁcate.

An attacker could use this to inject malicious maintenance requests (e.g. sending statistics, activating
remote support, exchanging the initial keys when onboarding, querying new extensions).

Siemens has released an update for the Industrial Edge Management and recommends to update to the
latest version.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-40147

The affected software does not properly validate the server certiﬁcate when initiating a TLS connection.
This could allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between
the client and the intended server.
