Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow caused by using `strcpy` without proper bounds checking when handling the "list" parameter in the `formSetQosBand` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function copies data from the `local_14` variable to the fixed-size `local_264` buffer on the stack without verifying the size of the data. This allows an attacker to write past the boundaries of the buffer.
- **Uncontrolled Input:** The length of the data from the "list" parameter is not validated, meaning an attacker can send an arbitrarily long string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting parts of the stack can lead to a crash, causing a DoS.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With careful crafting of the overflow data, an attacker can overwrite the return address or other critical data on the stack to gain remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList/` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is the "list" parameter within the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Tenda AC15 router.
- **Authentication:** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) suggests that an attacker needs to authenticate to the device by sending the proper username/password to `/login/Auth` before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The `formSetQosBand` function retrieves the "list" parameter using `FUN_0002ba8c` and then passes the data to `FUN_0007dd20`.
- In `FUN_0007dd20`, the input is copied to a stack buffer named `local_264` using `strcpy`, without any size checks. This is where the overflow occurs.
- The PoC demonstrates how a long string can be provided to the `list` parameter to trigger the stack overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The specific router firmware version affected is V15.03.05.19 (US\_AC15V1.0BR\_V15.03.05.19\_multi\_TD01.bin).
- The vulnerable code is in the `formSetQosBand` function, specifically the `strcpy` call inside `FUN_0007dd20`.
- The PoC uses `requests` python library to send malicious requests, including authentication.
