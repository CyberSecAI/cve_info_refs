Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `wi_restore_custom` function in `txt/restore.cgi` takes user-supplied input from an HTTP POST request and writes it to a temporary file. It parses each line of this file, expecting them to be in the `<nvram_key>=<nvram_value>` format, which are then used to compose a command using `sprintf` and executed using the `system()` function. The lack of input sanitization or validation on `nvram_key` and `nvram_value` before execution allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary weakness is the direct use of unsanitized user input in a system call, specifically through the `system()` function. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute any command that the router's operating system user running the httpd process has privileges to execute.
- **Full Device Compromise:** In the provided Proof of Concept (PoC), the attacker can add a new user to `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` and then use it to gain root access. This demonstrates the potential for a complete takeover of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/txt/restore.cgi`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.
- **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to provide a valid basic authentication header.
- **Crafted Request:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send a malicious HTTP POST request with a payload formatted to inject OS commands.
