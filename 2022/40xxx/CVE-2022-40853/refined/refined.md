- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function in the Tenda AC15 router firmware copies the content of the "ssid" parameter into stack buffers `acStack128` and `acStack192` using `strcpy` without any size checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow. The `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking, making it vulnerable to buffer overflows.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the router to crash by overflowing the stack.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): With carefully crafted overflow data, an attacker can potentially overwrite return addresses on the stack and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability can be triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint.
    - The attacker needs to send a request containing an "ssid" parameter with a value larger than the allocated stack buffer size (64 bytes).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router. This typically means they need to be on the same network as the router or be able to access it through other means (e.g., port forwarding).
    - The attacker should be able to authenticate to the router web interface or bypass authentication, since the provided PoC includes an authentication step.
