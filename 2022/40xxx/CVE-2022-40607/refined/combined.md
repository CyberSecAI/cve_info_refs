# Security Bulletin: A vulnerability in IBM Spectrum Scale CSI could allow unauthorized access (CVE-2022-40607)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A security vulnerability has been identified in IBM Spectrum Scale CSI that could allow unauthorized access. A fix for this vulnerability is available.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2022-40607](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40607)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Spectrum Scale | CSI 2.6.0 or before (CNSA 5.1.4.0 or before) |

## Remediation/Fixes

For IBM Spectrum Scale CSI 2.6.0 or before (CNSA 5.1.4.0 or before), apply Spectrum Scale CSI 2.6.1 or later (CNSA 5.1.4.1 or later)

If you are using standalone CSI, please follow the IBM Spectrum Scale CSI instructions for upgrade steps to Spectrum Scale CSI 2.6.1 or later :  [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-scale-csi](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-scale-csi "https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-scale-csi")

If you are using CSI deployed with CNSA, please follow the IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native instructions for upgrade steps to Spectrum Scale Container Native Storage Access 5.1.4.1 or later:  [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/scalecontainernative](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/scalecontainernative "https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/scalecontainernative")

**Note:** This security vulnerability does not impact the non-containerized Scale images used either as the base for the standalone CSI, or in a remote mount storage cluster for CSI or CNSA; however, the CSI or CNSA versions being upgraded to may require to upgrade the non-containerized Scale images in those environments.  The required non-containerized Scale can be downloaded from [FixCentral](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%20defined%20storage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Scale&release=5.1.5&platform=All&function=all "https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%20defined%20storage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Scale&release=5.1.5&platform=All&function=all").

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
