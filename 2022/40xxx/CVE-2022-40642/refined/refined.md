- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of X_B files within Ansys SpaceClaim, where a pointer is accessed before being properly initialized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper initialization of a pointer leading to use-after-free or similar memory access issues.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially gaining full control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious X_B file or visiting a malicious web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to entice the user to interact with the malicious file or web page. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
