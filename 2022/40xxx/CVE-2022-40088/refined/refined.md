Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the `index.php` file of the "Simple College Website" application. Specifically, the `page` parameter in the URL is directly included in the HTML response without any validation or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of sanitization and encoding. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `page` parameter, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful XSS attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can access sensitive information displayed on the page or interact with the web application on behalf of the user.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the appearance of the website.
- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users could be redirected to phishing websites or websites that distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `page` URL parameter.
  - Example: `http://<domain>/college_website/index.php?page=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker might need to trick the user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Understanding of Web Technologies:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript and how to craft XSS payloads.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** They need to be able to create URLs that include their malicious payload in the `page` parameter.
- **Delivery Mechanism:** An attacker may use phishing emails, social media, or other channels to distribute the crafted URL.
- **No special network access is needed**, as the attack can be carried out through any public-facing instance of the website.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided blog post mentions that the output is capitalized, which requires a specific payload that is not case-sensitive for the javascript execution.
- The blog post also suggests mitigation strategies like input filtering and output encoding.
- The vulnerable code is in the `index.php` file when handling the `page` parameter
