Installed this plugin to try, when I deactivate this my tabs are gone, instead the tabs show an error saying No such file or directory in /home/customer/www/‚Äî/public\_html/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/includes/wc-core-functions.php on line 345
After frantically trying to fix this problem, I fixed it by reinstalling woocommerce by manually installing the file.
Trash plugin. Beware.
