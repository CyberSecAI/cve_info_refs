- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Crafted data in a TIF image can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read during TIF image parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious TIF file or visits a malicious page containing the crafted TIF image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious TIF file to the user or trick the user into visiting a malicious page. User interaction is required.
