Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data in the "Content" field of the message creation feature in ZKBio Time. This allows an attacker to inject a CSV injection payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSV Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious CSV formulas into the "Content" field. When a user exports a report containing this crafted content and opens it in a spreadsheet program, the formulas are executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The execution of injected CSV formulas can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This can have serious consequences, including:
    *   Data theft or manipulation
    *   Malware installation
    *   System compromise

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Login to the ZKBio Time application.**
2.  **Navigate to the "Messages" -> "Public" section.**
3.  **Click on "ADD new message".**
4.  **Fill in the required fields, including the "Device Serial Number", "Date/Time", and "Duration".**
5.  **In the "Content" field, inject a CSV payload, such as `=cmd|' /C calc'!A0`.**
6.  **Save the message.**
7.  **Wait for a user to export a report containing the injected data in CSV format.**
8.  **The user opens the CSV file, which will trigger the execution of the embedded payload.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid account on the ZKBio Time application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the "Messages" -> "Public" section of the application to create messages.
*   The attacker must be able to inject the payload in the mentioned field
*   The attack relies on the victim opening the CSV file.

**Additional details:**
*   The blog post provides a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   It includes screenshots and examples of the exploit and the resulting calculator execution, illustrating the impact of the vulnerability.
*   The post also notes that users might ignore security warnings from spreadsheet applications, making the attack more likely to succeed.
*   It highlights the affected versions are 8.0.7 (Build: 20220721.14829) and before.
