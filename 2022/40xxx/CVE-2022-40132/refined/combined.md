## Description

Seriously Simple Podcasting is a top-rated podcasting plugin for WordPress, built by [Castos](https://castos.com/podcast-hosting-wordpress). Using the onboarding wizard to start a podcast, multiple player options to display your podcast on your site, and multiple free extension modules to supercharge your content, Seriously Simple Podcasting powers over 30K+ podcasts.

The plugin is, and will *always* remain, free to use. The only costs associated with using Seriously Simple Podcasting is if you choose to host your audio and video files with a dedicated podcast hosting provider, such as Castos. Similar to using a website hosting provider to keep your WordPress site fast and running smoothly, we recommend hosting podcast files with a dedicated provider. But remember, this isn’t required!

Every plugin feature is fully functional, no matter who you choose as your podcast hosting provider. Seriously Simple Podcasting gives you maximum control over your content so you can start podcasting without limits.

However, Castos is specifically designed to sync with Seriously Simple Podcasting to save you time in your publishing workflow. This means anytime you update your podcast’s information or upload a new episode file, the changes automatically sync with your Castos hosting account. You only have to do the action once, saving hours each week. Read more about how [Castos and Seriously Simple Podcasting work together](https://castos.com/how-castos-and-seriously-simple-podcasting-work-together/).

With other podcast providers, you’ll need to make updates to your podcast’s RSS feed via your hosting provider account and again on WordPress to manually sync the information.

**HOW TO SET UP SERIOUSLY SIMPLE PODCASTING**

Getting started with Seriously Simple Podcasting is a seriously simple process. In just four steps, you’ll go from installing the plugin to your WordPress site to submitting a functioning RSS feed to every podcast directory.

1. Install the Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin to your WordPress site.
2. Begin the onboarding wizard, and create your first podcast. Here you’ll give details like the Podcast Title, Description, and upload your cover image.
3. Then you can connect Seriously Simple Podcasting to your Castos account, if you’re hosting with Castos. This offloads all of the file storage and delivery from your WordPress site and host.
4. Last, it’s time to create your first podcast episode. You can do this either in the dedicated Podcasting section of your WordPress site, or in the regular Post area.
5. Once your podcast is live it’s time to distribute it to podcasting directories like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and other destinations.

**SERIOUSLY SIMPLE PODCASTING KEY FEATURES**

Seriously Simple Podcasting offers all of our advanced features through our free plugin. You’re not required to pay for additional add-ons or use a specific podcast hosting provider.

***SUPPORTS VIDEO PODCASTING***

Feature embedded video players within any podcast post.

* Embed video players from Vimeo, VideoPress, or the common video block.

The best things in life are simple. And so is thing plugin. As a developer of my own plugin with “simple” in the title, I know how hard it is to start a plugin as an entrepreneur and end up as a janitor. Thanks!
