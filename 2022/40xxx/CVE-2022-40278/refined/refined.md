{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `createDB` function in `provisioningdatabasemanager.c` does not free the error message returned by `sqlite3_exec` when an error occurs. This can lead to a memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak",
      "Missing sqlite3_free after sqlite3_exec when an error occurs"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability due to the memory leak. Repeated calls to `createDB` with inputs that trigger an error would eventually exhaust the available memory and cause a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "Repeated calls to the `createDB` function, likely through a program/script interacting with the vulnerable application",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to interact with the vulnerable application and trigger the execution of the `createDB` function"
  },
    "cve": "CVE-2022-40278"
