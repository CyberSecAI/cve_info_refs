The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Tenda ax1803 router firmware. Here's a breakdown of each:

**Vulnerability 1 (fromAdvSetMacMtuWan - Stack Overflow):**

*   **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow exists in the `fromAdvSetMacMtuWan` function. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the `wanMTU` parameter from an HTTP request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/AdvSetMacMtuWan` with an overly long `wanMTU` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.

**Vulnerability 2 (GetParentControlInfo - Heap Overflow):**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap buffer overflow in the `GetParentControlInfo` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` with a long `mac` parameter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.

**Vulnerability 3 (setSchedWifi - Heap Overflow):**

*  **Root Cause:** A heap buffer overflow in the `setSchedWifi` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/openSchedWifi` with a long `schedStartTime` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.

**Vulnerability 4 (sub_8C6C8 - Stack Overflow):**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack overflow in the `sub_8C6C8` function due to lack of bounds checking on the `wanSpeed` parameter. This is another instance of the overflow related to the `fromAdvSetMacMtuWan` endpoint
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack buffer overflow
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/AdvSetMacMtuWan` with an overly long `wanSpeed` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
*   **Additional Notes:** There are two more vulnerabilities in the same function with different offsets.

The provided content gives detailed proof-of-concept exploit code for each vulnerability, which includes crafting specific HTTP requests with oversized parameters to trigger the overflows.
