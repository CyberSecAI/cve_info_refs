The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in the Tenda AC15 router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `setSmartPowerManagement` function uses `sscanf` to parse the "time" parameter without proper size checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** The `sscanf` function copies data from the "time" parameter into stack variables (`local_2c`, `local_34`, `local_3c`, `local_44`) without validating the input length. This allows an attacker to write past the boundaries of the stack variables.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the router to crash.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code by overwriting return addresses or other critical data on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/PowerSaveSet/` endpoint. The malicious input is provided via the `time` parameter.
*   **Web interface:** The vulnerability is triggered via the web interface of the router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. This typically means being on the same network as the router or having network access to the router.
*   The attacker can bypass authentication using an authenticated session, as shown in the POC
