{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing X_B files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which allows writing past the end of an allocated data structure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious X_B file or visiting a malicious page that leads to parsing a malicious X_B file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious X_B file that, when parsed by the application, triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required to open this malicious file or visit a malicious page that uses this file."
