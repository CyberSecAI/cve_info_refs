The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `/comment` component of the `blog-ssm` application version 1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `commentText` parameter before displaying it on a webpage, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML code within the context of a victim's browser when they view a comment containing the malicious payload, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to register an account, log in, and then post a comment containing malicious javascript in the `commentText` parameter. Specifically, the attacker must craft a POST request with the `contentId` and the malicious `commentText` that will be stored. When a user views the comment, the stored script will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a valid account on the target system and be able to post comments.
