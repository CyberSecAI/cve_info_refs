Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `save_virtualser_data` function within the `/bin/httpd` binary of the Tenda AC21 router firmware.
- The `sscanf` function is used to read data from a string (`v9`/`a2`) into a stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the use of `sscanf` without any length limitation when copying data to a fixed-size buffer on the stack. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that sending a specially crafted `list` parameter to the `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` endpoint can cause the `httpd` process to crash and reboot.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the provided PoC only demonstrates DoS, a stack buffer overflow can potentially be exploited to achieve RCE by overwriting the return address on the stack with malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is `list`, which is part of the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
- **Authenticated (Likely):** The provided PoC includes a `Cookie: password=...` header, which suggests that the attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. However, more information is needed to confirm whether a valid or specific password is required.
- **Knowledge of the Endpoint and Parameter:** The attacker must know the target endpoint `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` and the vulnerable parameter `list`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda AC21(V16.03.08.15).
- The vulnerable functions are `formSetVirtualSer` (where the request is handled) and `save_virtualser_data` (where the overflow happens).
- The vulnerability exists because the `sscanf` function in `save_virtualser_data` reads data into stack buffer without length validation.

This information aligns with the nature of a stack buffer overflow vulnerability and provides sufficient details about its cause, impact, and exploitation.
