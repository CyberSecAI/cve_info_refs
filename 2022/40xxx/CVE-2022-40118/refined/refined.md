{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `send_funds_action.php` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection vulnerability",
      "Lack of input sanitization for the `cust_id` parameter received via `$_GET`."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this specific instance, the attacker is shown to be able to inject a sleep function to demonstrate the SQL injection and potentially can retrieve sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker can manipulate the `cust_id` parameter in the URL of `send_funds_action.php`.",
      "The attacker can send a crafted GET request to inject malicious SQL code through the `cust_id` parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to send an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the cust_id parameter. No authentication is needed since the injection is happening after the user is logged in."
