Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL Injection vulnerability in the `feature_edit.php` file of the Wedding Planner v1.0 application. The application fails to properly sanitize the `id` parameter passed via the GET request, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization when processing the `id` parameter in the `feature_edit.php` file. This allows for arbitrary SQL code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: The provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract database information, including the database name (`dbwedding`), by using `union select` statement.
- Potential for further exploitation: This vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete database content, escalate privileges, or compromise the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `feature_edit.php` file with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting the Wedding Planner application.
- The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable script (`/Wedding-Management-PHP/admin/feature_edit.php`).
- The attacker needs to craft the malicious SQL injection payload, as demonstrated in the provided example.
