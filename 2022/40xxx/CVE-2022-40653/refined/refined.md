- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of X_B files, which leads to a write past the end of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, where the target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific vulnerability lies in the parsing of X_B files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious X_B file or a link to a malicious page containing a crafted X_B file to the victim.
