- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's upload and download functionality is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data in file uploads, leading to execution of malicious JavaScript when the files are downloaded.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escalate privileges or compromise accounts by tricking users into observing targeted files containing the malicious XSS payload.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker uploads a file containing a malicious XSS payload to the application. When a user downloads this file, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application with file upload privileges.
