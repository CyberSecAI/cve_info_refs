Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload a file with a .png extension, which is not validated server side, then rename it to an executable extension such as .aspx, and access it, thus allowing for code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - Unrestricted file upload: The application allows uploading files with a .png extension without proper validation.
  - Lack of extension validation: The application doesn't prevent renaming a file to an executable extension after upload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Remote code execution: By uploading a malicious .aspx file, renaming it, and accessing it, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - File upload: The attacker uploads a malicious file disguised as a .png image.
   - File renaming: The attacker renames the uploaded .png file to an .aspx file.
   - Direct access to uploaded file: The attacker can then directly access the renamed file via a web request, resulting in code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - Authenticated access: The attacker must have a valid user account to access the file manager.
  - Network access: The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the application.
