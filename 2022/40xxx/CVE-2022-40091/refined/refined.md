Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `update_packages.php` file of the Online Tours & Travels management system.
*   The `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in a database query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as database name, table structures, user credentials, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Besides reading data, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database, causing data integrity issues or disrupting the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious GET request to the vulnerable `update_packages.php` endpoint with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint (`update_packages.php`) and the parameter (`id`).
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/tour/admin/update_packages.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
*   **Payload Example:** `/tour/admin/update_packages.php?id=1' union select 1,database(),3,4--+`
*   The payload utilizes a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract the database name, demonstrating the SQL injection.
* The application uses a MySQL database named tour1.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a GitHub link to a report detailing the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The report also mentions the login credentials for a super admin account which could further aid an attacker who has already exploited the SQL Injection.
* The vulnerable software is Online Tours & Travels management system v1.0 by mayuri\_k.
