- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing X_B files, which can lead to a read before the start of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious X_B file or visiting a malicious page containing a malicious X_B file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious X_B file or a web page that can be opened by the victim. User interaction is required to open the file or visit the malicious page.
