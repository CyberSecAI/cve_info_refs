### CVE-2022-40199
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal issue. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when dealing with file paths, allowing an attacker to potentially access directories outside of the intended scope.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Directory traversal (CWE-22). The application is vulnerable to directory traversal, which allows an attacker to access arbitrary directories. Specifically, the `checkDir` function in `FileController.php`, the handling of payment images in `PaymentController.php`, and the file path validation in `ProductType.php` do not properly validate paths, leading to this vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who is able to login to the product may obtain the product's directory structure information.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker with administrative privileges who can log in to the product could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating file paths used in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to log in to the EC-CUBE application. This typically implies having an administrative account or being able to otherwise authenticate to the application.
