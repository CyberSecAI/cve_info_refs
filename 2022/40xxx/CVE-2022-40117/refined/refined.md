Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `$_GET['cust_id']` parameter in the `delete_customer.php` file. This parameter, which is used to identify the customer to be deleted, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of input validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Because the `cust_id` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query, an attacker can manipulate the query by injecting malicious SQL code.
*   **Unprotected User Input:** The application directly uses user-provided input (`$_GET['cust_id']`) in an SQL query without any form of sanitization or prepared statements.
*   **Session Misuse**: The `$_GET['cust_id']` is set to the session variable, `$_SESSION['cust_id']`, which is then used in the SQL query. This increases the impact if this ID is modified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the database by injecting malicious SQL code. In the provided example, the attacker uses a `BENCHMARK` function to cause a delay, which is a common technique to verify if the injection was successful and for DoS.
*   **Data Deletion:** The provided example shows an attacker can delete a customer record and associated tables. They can also escalate this to delete any data in the database.
*   **Potential Data Breach:** Depending on the context of the application and the attacker's creativity, data could be extracted, modified, or deleted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `delete_customer.php` script, where the `cust_id` parameter contains malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application to send the crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of HTTP requests, SQL syntax, and web application parameters.
*  **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable parameter, `cust_id`, and the script that processes it, `delete_customer.php`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the SQL injection by injecting a `BENCHMARK` function, which can cause a delay. This confirms the vulnerability exists and is exploitable. The PoC also demonstrates that the `cust_id` parameter is passed through GET requests and uses it in SQL DELETE and DROP queries.
