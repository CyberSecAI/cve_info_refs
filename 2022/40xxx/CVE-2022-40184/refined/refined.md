- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incomplete filtering of JavaScript code in different configuration fields of the web based interface of the VIDEOJET multi 4000.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the web-based interface configuration fields.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with administrative privileges can store malicious JavaScript code in the configuration which is then executed for any other administrators accessing the same configuration. This could lead to account compromise or other malicious activities by impersonating or hijacking the administrator's session.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with administrative access can input malicious javascript code in vulnerable configuration fields accessible via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires administrative privileges on the device. The attacker needs to access the web interface with administrative credentials.
