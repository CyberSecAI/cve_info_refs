Customers are advised to update to the fixed version or follow listed mitigations.

## Affected Products

* Bosch VIDEOJET multi 4000
  + CVE-2022-40183, CVE-2022-40184
    - Version(s): <= 6.31.0010

## Solution and Mitigations

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the Bosch VIDEOJET multi 4000 to the fixed version. Please refer to appendix for list of affected versions and available updates.

A reboot is required after applying the update. To check whether the update has been successfully applied, please check the version e.g. in the web based interface (Service - System Overview).

If the update is not possible in a target environment, users are recommended to follow the mitigations described in the following section.

### Secure Configuration Environment

It is advised to use a Bosch tool like the Configuration Manager to configure the encoder, that is not vulnerable to issues like XSS (Cross Site Scripting) or CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery).

When using the web based configuration interface and currently being logged in as an administrator, some security precautions can be taken to mitigate XSS or CSRF vulnerabilities:

* No other websites or email content should be opened as long as the session to the encoder is active.
* No links should be clicked from an untrusted external source that link back to the encoder.
* Use a different browser than the system default browser to open a session to the encoder as there is no XSS or CSRF between browsers.
* Always log out and/or close the browser (not only the tab) to clear any session data.

### Secure Administration

A stored XSS attack is only possible when an user with administrative rights is able to save malicious JavaScript code on the device. Only trusted users should have access to the administrative interface and common security rules for administrative credentials should be followed (e.g. using strong, unique passwords).

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2022-40183

CVE description: An error in the URL handler of the VIDEOJET multi 4000 may lead to a reflected cross site scripting (XSS) in the web-based interface. An attacker with knowledge of the encoder address can send a crafted link to a user, which will execute JavaScript code in the context of the user.
