Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-40348

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Intern Record System 1.0 fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data submitted through the 'name' and 'email' parameters in the `/intern/controller.php` endpoint. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The malicious scripts are stored in the system and then executed when other users view the data.
- Lack of input validation and output encoding on the 'name' and 'email' parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of unsuspecting users who access the vulnerable application, in the context of the affected site.
- The attacker can potentially steal cookie-based authentication credentials, leading to session hijacking or impersonation of users.
- Other attacks might also be launched, such as redirecting users to malicious sites or performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `/intern/controller.php` with malicious JavaScript payloads in the `name` and `email` parameters.
- The injected script is then triggered when a user visits `/intern/view.php`, which displays the stored data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoint (`/intern/controller.php`).
- No special privileges are required to inject the malicious script code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Intern Record System, which can be downloaded from the provided link: `https://download-media.code-projects.org/2020/03/Intern_Record_System_In_PHP_With_Source_Code.zip`
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) includes example payloads:
    - `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`
    - `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
- Example Burp Suite requests are provided, showing how to inject the malicious script through the `name` and `email` parameters.
- The vulnerable parameters are within the `/intern/controller.php` file and are reflected in `/intern/view.php`.
