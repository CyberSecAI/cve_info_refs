  "summary": "The vulnerability stems from a buffer copy within the qcom_mdt_read_metadata function in the Linux kernel, specifically in versions prior to 5.0. This flaw could lead to memory corruption due to lack of input size validation, potentially allowing for information disclosure, data modification, or denial-of-service attacks.",
  "details": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause of vulnerability",
      "value": "The vulnerability is due to a missing input size check during a buffer copy operation within the `qcom_mdt_read_metadata` function of the Linux kernel's `drivers/soc/qcom/mdt_loader.c` file."
