The provided content details three distinct vulnerabilities in Tenda ax1803, none of which relate to CVE-2022-40874, which is a placeholder.

The three vulnerabilities are:

**Vulnerability 1: Stack Overflow in `fromAdvSetMacMtuWan`**

*   **Root cause:** A stack buffer overflow exists in the `fromAdvSetMacMtuWan` function.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when processing the `wanMTU` parameter in an HTTP request.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/AdvSetMacMtuWan` with an overly long `wanMTU` parameter.
*   **Required capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
*   **Details:** The provided exploit demonstrates how to overwrite return addresses and gain code execution. The exploit crafts a payload to call the `system` function.

**Vulnerability 2: Heap Overflow in `GetParentControlInfo`**

*   **Root cause:** A heap buffer overflow exists in the `GetParentControlInfo` function.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when processing the `mac` parameter in an HTTP request.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
*  **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` with an overly long `mac` parameter.
*   **Required capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
*   **Details**: The provided exploit demonstrates how to cause a crash by overflowing a heap buffer.

**Vulnerability 3: Heap Overflow in `setSchedWifi`**

*   **Root cause:** A heap buffer overflow exists in the `setSchedWifi` function.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when processing the `schedStartTime` parameter in an HTTP request.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/openSchedWifi` with an overly long `schedStartTime` parameter.
*  **Required capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
*   **Details:** The provided exploit shows how to cause a crash by overflowing a heap buffer

**Summary:**
The provided content describes three distinct vulnerabilities: a stack overflow and two heap overflows, affecting different functions in the Tenda ax1803 firmware. These can be exploited with crafted HTTP requests.

These vulnerabilities are distinct from the placeholder CVE-2022-40874.
