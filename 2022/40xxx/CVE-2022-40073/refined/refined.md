The provided content contains information about a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC21 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `compare_parentcontrol_time` function within the `/bin/httpd` binary.
- The `sscanf` function is used with the format string `"%[^-]-%s"` to parse a time parameter. The second `%s` reads data into a stack buffer (`v4`) without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack buffer overflow when the input string is too long.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `compare_parentcontrol_time` function due to unchecked input to `sscanf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by overflowing the stack buffer, crashing the httpd process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint.
- The `time` parameter within this POST request must contain a long string to overflow the buffer during parsing by the `sscanf` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tenda AC21 router (local network access).
- No authentication is required, as the cookie appears to be bypassed by the exploit.
