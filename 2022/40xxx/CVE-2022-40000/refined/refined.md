Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the Feehi CMS backend. The system allows admin users to input arbitrary data, which is then rendered on the site without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected into the webpage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Account Compromise:** If an attacker gets access to an admin account, they can inject malicious code that will execute when other users access the website, potentially leading to session hijacking or account compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Form Requests:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code via form requests submitted to the Feehi CMS backend.
- **Admin Panel:** The vulnerability is specifically located in the backend of Feehi CMS, accessible by admin users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Admin Access:** An attacker requires access to an administrative account to inject the malicious code. This could be achieved through compromised credentials or other means of access.
