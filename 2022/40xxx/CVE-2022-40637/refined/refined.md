- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of validation of the existence of an object before operations are performed on it during the parsing of JT files. This can lead to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must provide a malicious JT file to be opened by the target user. The user must interact by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious JT file. They would need to convince the user to open the file.
