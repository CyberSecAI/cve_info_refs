| We discovered a potential code execution backdoor in version 0.1.0 of the project, the backdoor is the democritus-file-system package. Attackers can upload democritus-file-system packages containing arbitrary malicious code. For the safety of this project, the democritus-file-system package has been uploaded by us.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58363074/190449047-0f382649-7e8f-475d-9066-cff5d51770a8.png)  The democritus-file-system package can be successfully installed using `pip install d8s-urls==0.1.0`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58363074/190449686-e29b382b-20e0-4cce-8836-9165d1b566bc.png)  Suggestion: remove version 0.1.0 of this project in PyPI |

| [@di1l0o](https://github.com/di1l0o): Thanks for reporting this issue, but this is not something I'm going to resolve as no-one should be using such an old version of this library (and this library isn't widely used anyway).  [@di1l0o](https://github.com/di1l0o): Can you please stop creating these issues? I appreciate the help and your concern, but this is really not a concern and is not worth the time it takes to fix. |
