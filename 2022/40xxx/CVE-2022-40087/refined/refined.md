Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `admin_class.php` file, specifically in how the `save_page` function handles file creation. The `file_put_contents()` function is used to create files based on user-supplied content without any validation of the filename or content. This allows an attacker to create arbitrary files with malicious content, such as a PHP webshell.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the admin panel.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There is no validation of the filename or the content of the file being created, which allows the upload of files with malicious content (e.g., PHP code).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP webshell, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a full system compromise.
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** The attacker can create any type of file on the server with arbitrary content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker crafts a POST request to `manage_page.php` with the `save_page` function.
- The attacker injects a malicious payload (e.g., a PHP webshell) in the `page_content` parameter of the POST request and specifies the desired file name.
- The server creates the file with the malicious content using `file_put_contents()`, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable code is present in the `Simple College Website 1.0` project, available from the sourcecodester.com website.
- The exploit is easily reproducible, as demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept.
- The provided PoC exploit code on Github can be used to exploit the vulnerability.

**Remediation:**

- **Authentication:** Implement authentication checks for all requests that modify files.
- **Filename Validation:** Validate and sanitize filenames to prevent the creation of malicious file types.
- **Input Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user-supplied data that is used in `file_put_contents()` to prevent the execution of arbitrary code.
