- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application returns different error messages during a password reset attempt, based on whether the provided username, email, or ID is valid.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Password/user enumeration. The vulnerability stems from inconsistent responses based on the validity of the provided user identifiers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can enumerate valid usernames, email addresses, or IDs within the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker interacts with the password reset page, specifically the "/opencrx-core-CRX/RequestPasswordReset.jsp" endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs network access to the application's password reset page. They do not require prior authentication.
