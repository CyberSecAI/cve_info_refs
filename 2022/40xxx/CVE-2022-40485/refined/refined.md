The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Wedding Planner v1.0 application by pushpam02.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/Wedding-Management-PHP/package_detail.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration (retrieval of sensitive information from the database, such as credentials).
  - Data modification (altering or deleting data).
  - Potential complete compromise of the application and underlying system, depending on database permissions.
- The provided example demonstrates the attacker's ability to determine the database name (`dbwedding`).

**Attack vectors:**
-  HTTP GET request to `/Wedding-Management-PHP/package_detail.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific authentication or privilege is explicitly mentioned as being required for exploitation.
