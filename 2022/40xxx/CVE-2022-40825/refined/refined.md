Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way CodeIgniter's database functions `_wh()`, `_where_in()`, and `_like()` handle query fields. These functions do not filter or sanitize the query fields, making them vulnerable to SQL injection if a developer uses user-controlled input directly as a field name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the input used for the query fields, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the database queries.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided input before using it as a column name in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** As mentioned in the comments, this vulnerability can lead to authentication bypass, potentially granting unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Full Control of Database:** In severe cases, attackers can gain full control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Controlled Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input, typically via GET or POST parameters, that is then used to specify the fields in a database query.
*   **Direct Field Manipulation:** An attacker can directly manipulate the input that specifies the database field name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:** The attacker needs to identify CodeIgniter applications where user input is directly used in the vulnerable database functions (`_wh()`, `_where_in()`, `_like()`)
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker can be an external user or someone who can send crafted HTTP requests to the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is not within the framework itself but rather in how the developers are utilizing the framework and handling user input within their applications.
*   The comments mention that this type of vulnerability is often due to "carelessly programming" practices.
*   The vulnerability can lead to an "Authentication Bypass" as explained by LiveOverflow.
*   Although the provided video example is for CI4, the same vulnerability exists in CI3.
*   Using user input directly as field identifiers is insecure. Even prepared statements don't protect against this type of misuse.
