- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server does not change the session cookie value after successful authentication. This allows a malicious user to specify their own session token value, and this token remains unchanged even after multiple authentications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session fixation vulnerability. The server fails to regenerate session identifiers upon successful login, making it possible for attackers to hijack user sessions by setting a known session ID.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can potentially hijack another user's session by setting a known session ID, gaining unauthorized access to the application/system.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user can specify their own session token value. The attacker can exploit this by first setting a known session ID for a victim, and then tricking the victim into authenticating. Since the session ID doesn't change upon successful login, the attacker now has a valid session ID and can hijack the session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to set a session token, and then needs to trick the legitimate user into authenticating.
