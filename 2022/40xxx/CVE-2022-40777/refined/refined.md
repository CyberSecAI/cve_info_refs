Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-40777

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation or sanitization in the `surveys_submit.php` file within the Interspire Email Marketer application, specifically when handling file uploads during the "create survey and submit survey" operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without sufficient checks on the file type, extension, or content. This bypasses expected security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A malicious actor can upload a PHP file, which can then be accessed and executed by the webserver, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows for full control of the web server, allowing attackers to potentially steal data, modify content, install backdoors, and further compromise the system or other systems on the same network.
*   **Web Shell:** The attacker can plant a web shell allowing persistent access to the server.
*   **System Compromise:** The overall impact of this is a complete compromise of the server and its associated data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker would craft a malicious request, likely a POST request to `/admin/temp/surveys/`, containing a malicious PHP file disguised as a legitimate file during the survey submission process.
*   **Surveys Addon:** This vulnerability requires the Surveys addon for Interspire Email Marketer to be enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the application:** The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the survey creation and submission feature, which typically requires a user account with sufficient privileges.
*   **Understanding of the Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `surveys_submit.php` endpoint and the file upload process to craft a malicious request.
*   **No other privileges required:** Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require admin level access to the application, as it is exploitable by regular users that have access to the survey functionality.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Interspire Email Marketer versions 6.0.0 through 6.5.0.

**Mitigation:**
The recommended actions include disabling the survey addon, deleting the vulnerable file (`~/surveys_submit.php`) and applying the patched version, or upgrading to version 6.5.1.
