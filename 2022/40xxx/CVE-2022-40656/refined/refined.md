- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of ND2 files, where crafted data can cause a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by getting the user to open a malicious ND2 file or visit a malicious page containing the crafted file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious ND2 file and have a user open it with the vulnerable software. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
