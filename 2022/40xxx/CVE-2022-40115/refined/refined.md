The provided content is related to CVE-2022-40115.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of the `$_GET['cust_id']` parameter in the `delete_beneficiary.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code into the query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability
- Unsanitized user input

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration
  - Data modification
  - Denial of Service

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `cust_id` parameter in the GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoint (`delete_beneficiary.php`) with a crafted `cust_id` parameter.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement to exploit the vulnerability, it is implied that an attacker could be unauthenticated if the beneficiary deletion is not restricted by an authenticated session.
