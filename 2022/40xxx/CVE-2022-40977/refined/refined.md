- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PASvisu Server does not properly check pathnames when receiving and processing a configuration file. Specifically, the server is vulnerable to path traversal via a zipped, malicious configuration file (zip-slip).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker could write arbitrary files to the system. In the worst-case scenario this could lead to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can upload a malicious zipped configuration file containing path traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the PASvisu Server over the network and the server should not have an administrative password set.
