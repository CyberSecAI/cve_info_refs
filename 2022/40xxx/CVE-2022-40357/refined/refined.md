{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly validate the `source` parameter in the `action_crawler.php` file, allowing arbitrary URLs to be injected into it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can force the application to make arbitrary requests, potentially probing intranet web services or interacting with internal resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted GET request to the `/zblog/zb_users/plugin/UEditor/php/controller.php` endpoint with the `action=catchimage` and a malicious URL in the `source` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. They do not need to be authenticated.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the `saveRemote` function of `Uploader.class.php`. While there is a check for `http` at the beginning of the URL, the vulnerability is still present because no further validation of the URL is performed."
