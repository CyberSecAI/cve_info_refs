Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `send_funds.php` file where the `$_GET['cust_id']` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The code directly concatenates the `$_GET['cust_id']` parameter into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerable line is: `$sql0 = "SELECT * FROM customer WHERE cust_id=".$id;`
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `cust_id` parameter received via the GET request before using it in the database query.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, such as customer information or financial records.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on database privileges, a successful SQL injection could allow the attacker to escalate privileges within the database server.
    *   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially use SQL injection to make the database server unresponsive. In this specific case, the provided PoC includes a `SLEEP(5)` function, which may cause delays on the database server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request where the malicious SQL injection payload is passed through the `cust_id` parameter.
    *   **Target:** The target is the vulnerable `send_funds.php` file, which processes the unsanitized user-provided input.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads in order to exploit the vulnerability.
