These routines open an SQLite database file as specified by the
filename argument. The filename argument is interpreted as UTF-8 for
sqlite3\_open() and sqlite3\_open\_v2() and as UTF-16 in the native byte
order for sqlite3\_open16(). A [database connection](../c3ref/sqlite3.html) handle is usually
returned in \*ppDb, even if an error occurs. The only exception is that
if SQLite is unable to allocate memory to hold the [sqlite3](../c3ref/sqlite3.html) object,
a NULL will be written into \*ppDb instead of a pointer to the [sqlite3](../c3ref/sqlite3.html)
object. If the database is opened (and/or created) successfully, then
[SQLITE\_OK](../rescode.html#ok) is returned. Otherwise an [error code](../rescode.html) is returned. The
[sqlite3\_errmsg()](../c3ref/errcode.html) or [sqlite3\_errmsg16()](../c3ref/errcode.html) routines can be used to obtain
an English language description of the error following a failure of any
of the sqlite3\_open() routines.

The default encoding will be UTF-8 for databases created using
sqlite3\_open() or sqlite3\_open\_v2(). The default encoding for databases
created using sqlite3\_open16() will be UTF-16 in the native byte order.

Whether or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources
associated with the [database connection](../c3ref/sqlite3.html) handle should be released by
passing it to [sqlite3\_close()](../c3ref/close.html) when it is no longer required.

The sqlite3\_open\_v2() interface works like sqlite3\_open()
except that it accepts two additional parameters for additional control
over the new database connection. The flags parameter to
sqlite3\_open\_v2() must include, at a minimum, one of the following
three flag combinations:

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_READONLY](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The database is opened in read-only mode. If the database does
not already exist, an error is returned.

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_READWRITE](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The database is opened for reading and writing if possible, or
reading only if the file is write protected by the operating
system. In either case the database must already exist, otherwise
an error is returned. For historical reasons, if opening in
read-write mode fails due to OS-level permissions, an attempt is
made to open it in read-only mode. [sqlite3\_db\_readonly()](../c3ref/db_readonly.html) can be
used to determine whether the database is actually
read-write.

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_READWRITE](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) | [SQLITE\_OPEN\_CREATE](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The database is opened for reading and writing, and is created if
it does not already exist. This is the behavior that is always used for
sqlite3\_open() and sqlite3\_open16().

In addition to the required flags, the following optional flags are
also supported:

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_URI](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The filename can be interpreted as a URI if this flag is set.

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_MEMORY](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The database will be opened as an in-memory database. The database
is named by the "filename" argument for the purposes of cache-sharing,
if shared cache mode is enabled, but the "filename" is otherwise ignored.

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_NOMUTEX](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The new database connection will use the "multi-thread"
[threading mode](../threadsafe.html). This means that separate threads are allowed
to use SQLite at the same time, as long as each thread is using
a different [database connection](../c3ref/sqlite3.html).

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_FULLMUTEX](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The new database connection will use the "serialized"
[threading mode](../threadsafe.html). This means the multiple threads can safely
attempt to use the same database connection at the same time.
(Mutexes will block any actual concurrency, but in this mode
there is no harm in trying.)

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_SHAREDCACHE](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The database is opened [shared cache](../sharedcache.html) enabled, overriding
the default shared cache setting provided by
[sqlite3\_enable\_shared\_cache()](../c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html).
The [use of shared cache mode is discouraged](../sharedcache.html#dontuse) and hence shared cache
capabilities may be omitted from many builds of SQLite. In such cases,
this option is a no-op.

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_PRIVATECACHE](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The database is opened [shared cache](../sharedcache.html) disabled, overriding
the default shared cache setting provided by
[sqlite3\_enable\_shared\_cache()](../c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html).

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_EXRESCODE](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The database connection comes up in "extended result code mode".
In other words, the database behaves as if
[sqlite3\_extended\_result\_codes(db,1)](../c3ref/extended_result_codes.html) were called on the database
connection as soon as the connection is created. In addition to setting
the extended result code mode, this flag also causes [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](../c3ref/open.html)
to return an extended result code.

[SQLITE\_OPEN\_NOFOLLOW](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
The database filename is not allowed to contain a symbolic link

If the 3rd parameter to sqlite3\_open\_v2() is not one of the
required combinations shown above optionally combined with other
[SQLITE\_OPEN\_\* bits](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html)
then the behavior is undefined. Historic versions of SQLite
have silently ignored surplus bits in the flags parameter to
sqlite3\_open\_v2(), however that behavior might not be carried through
into future versions of SQLite and so applications should not rely
upon it. Note in particular that the SQLITE\_OPEN\_EXCLUSIVE flag is a no-op
for sqlite3\_open\_v2(). The SQLITE\_OPEN\_EXCLUSIVE does \*not\* cause
the open to fail if the database already exists. The SQLITE\_OPEN\_EXCLUSIVE
flag is intended for use by the [VFS interface](../c3ref/vfs.html) only, and not
by sqlite3\_open\_v2().

The fourth parameter to sqlite3\_open\_v2() is the name of the
[sqlite3\_vfs](../c3ref/vfs.html) object that defines the operating system interface that
the new database connection should use. If the fourth parameter is
a NULL pointer then the default [sqlite3\_vfs](../c3ref/vfs.html) object is used.

If the filename is ":memory:", then a private, temporary in-memory database
is created for the connection. This in-memory database will vanish when
the database connection is closed. Future versions of SQLite might
make use of additional special filenames that begin with the ":" character.
It is recommended that when a database filename actually does begin with
a ":" character you should prefix the filename with a pathname such as
"./" to avoid ambiguity.

If the filename is an empty string, then a private, temporary
on-disk database will be created. This private database will be
automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed.

### URI Filenames

If [URI filename](../uri.html) interpretation is enabled, and the filename argument
begins with "file:", then the filename is interpreted as a URI. URI
filename interpretation is enabled if the [SQLITE\_OPEN\_URI](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) flag is
set in the third argument to sqlite3\_open\_v2(), or if it has
been enabled globally using the [SQLITE\_CONFIG\_URI](../c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfiguri) option with the
[sqlite3\_config()](../c3ref/config.html) method or by the [SQLITE\_USE\_URI](../compile.html#use_uri) compile-time option.
URI filename interpretation is turned off
by default, but future releases of SQLite might enable URI filename
interpretation by default. See "[URI filenames](../uri.html)" for additional
information.

URI filenames are parsed according to RFC 3986. If the URI contains an
authority, then it must be either an empty string or the string
"localhost". If the authority is not an empty string or "localhost", an
error is returned to the caller. The fragment component of a URI, if
present, is ignored.

SQLite uses the path component of the URI as the name of the disk file
which contains the database. If the path begins with a '/' character,
then it is interpreted as an absolute path. If the path does not begin
with a '/' (meaning that the authority section is omitted from the URI)
then the path is interpreted as a relative path.
On windows, the first component of an absolute path
is a drive specification (e.g. "C:").

The query component of a URI may contain parameters that are interpreted
either by SQLite itself, or by a [custom VFS implementation](../vfs.html).
SQLite and its built-in [VFSes](../vfs.html) interpret the
following query parameters:

* **vfs**: The "vfs" parameter may be used to specify the name of
  a VFS object that provides the operating system interface that should
  be used to access the database file on disk. If this option is set to
  an empty string the default VFS object is used. Specifying an unknown
  VFS is an error. If sqlite3\_open\_v2() is used and the vfs option is
  present, then the VFS specified by the option takes precedence over
  the value passed as the fourth parameter to sqlite3\_open\_v2().

- **mode**: The mode parameter may be set to either "ro", "rw",
  "rwc", or "memory". Attempting to set it to any other value is
  an error.
  If "ro" is specified, then the database is opened for read-only
  access, just as if the [SQLITE\_OPEN\_READONLY](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) flag had been set in the
  third argument to sqlite3\_open\_v2(). If the mode option is set to
  "rw", then the database is opened for read-write (but not create)
  access, as if SQLITE\_OPEN\_READWRITE (but not SQLITE\_OPEN\_CREATE) had
  been set. Value "rwc" is equivalent to setting both
  SQLITE\_OPEN\_READWRITE and SQLITE\_OPEN\_CREATE. If the mode option is
  set to "memory" then a pure [in-memory database](../inmemorydb.html) that never reads
  or writes from disk is used. It is an error to specify a value for
  the mode parameter that is less restrictive than that specified by
  the flags passed in the third parameter to sqlite3\_open\_v2().

- **cache**: The cache parameter may be set to either "shared" or
  "private". Setting it to "shared" is equivalent to setting the
  SQLITE\_OPEN\_SHAREDCACHE bit in the flags argument passed to
  sqlite3\_open\_v2(). Setting the cache parameter to "private" is
  equivalent to setting the SQLITE\_OPEN\_PRIVATECACHE bit.
  If sqlite3\_open\_v2() is used and the "cache" parameter is present in
  a URI filename, its value overrides any behavior requested by setting
  SQLITE\_OPEN\_PRIVATECACHE or SQLITE\_OPEN\_SHAREDCACHE flag.

- **psow**: The psow parameter indicates whether or not the
  [powersafe overwrite](../psow.html) property does or does not apply to the
  storage media on which the database file resides.

- **nolock**: The nolock parameter is a boolean query parameter
  which if set disables file locking in rollback journal modes. This
  is useful for accessing a database on a filesystem that does not
  support locking. Caution: Database corruption might result if two
  or more processes write to the same database and any one of those
  processes uses nolock=1.

- **immutable**: The immutable parameter is a boolean query
  parameter that indicates that the database file is stored on
  read-only media. When immutable is set, SQLite assumes that the
  database file cannot be changed, even by a process with higher
  privilege, and so the database is opened read-only and all locking
  and change detection is disabled. Caution: Setting the immutable
  property on a database file that does in fact change can result
  in incorrect query results and/or [SQLITE\_CORRUPT](../rescode.html#corrupt) errors.

Specifying an unknown parameter in the query component of a URI is not an
error. Future versions of SQLite might understand additional query
parameters. See "[query parameters with special meaning to SQLite](../uri.html#coreqp)" for
additional information.

### URI filename examples

| URI filenames Results| file:data.db Open the file "data.db" in the current directory.| file:/home/fred/data.db file:///home/fred/data.db  file://localhost/home/fred/data.db  Open the database file "/home/fred/data.db".| file://darkstar/home/fred/data.db An error. "darkstar" is not a recognized authority.| file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/fred/Desktop/data.db Windows only: Open the file "data.db" on fred's desktop on drive C:. Note that the %20 escaping in this example is not strictly necessary - space characters can be used literally in URI filenames.| file:data.db?mode=ro&cache=private Open file "data.db" in the current directory for read-only access. Regardless of whether or not shared-cache mode is enabled by default, use a private cache.| file:/home/fred/data.db?vfs=unix-dotfile Open file "/home/fred/data.db". Use the special VFS "unix-dotfile" that uses dot-files in place of posix advisory locking.| file:data.db?mode=readonly An error. "readonly" is not a valid option for the "mode" parameter. Use "ro" instead: "file:data.db?mode=ro". | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

URI hexadecimal escape sequences (%HH) are supported within the path and
query components of a URI. A hexadecimal escape sequence consists of a
percent sign - "%" - followed by exactly two hexadecimal digits
specifying an octet value. Before the path or query components of a
URI filename are interpreted, they are encoded using UTF-8 and all
hexadecimal escape sequences replaced by a single byte containing the
corresponding octet. If this process generates an invalid UTF-8 encoding,
the results are undefined.

**Note to Windows users:** The encoding used for the filename argument
of sqlite3\_open() and sqlite3\_open\_v2() must be UTF-8, not whatever
codepage is currently defined. Filenames containing international
characters must be converted to UTF-8 prior to passing them into
sqlite3\_open() or sqlite3\_open\_v2().

**Note to Windows Runtime users:** The temporary directory must be set
prior to calling sqlite3\_open() or sqlite3\_open\_v2(). Otherwise, various
features that require the use of temporary files may fail.
