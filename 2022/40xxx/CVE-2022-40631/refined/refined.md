- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected SCALANCE X-200 and X-200IRT series devices. This vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal session cookies, which could then be used to perform session hijacking. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), and requires user interaction (UI:R) as the malicious script would likely need to be triggered by a user browsing the web interface. No privileges are needed to execute the attack (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted script to the vulnerable web interface. The attacker doesn't need any prior knowledge of the system or specific user privileges. The vulnerability exists in the web interface of the device, so the attacker needs to reach that interface to trigger the vulnerability.
