Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the `host` field being parsed as HTML by the browser in the front-end code of `gocron/web/vue/src/pages/taskLog/list.vue`, specifically around line 91.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to XSS because it renders user-supplied input (the `host` field) without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `host` field, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when viewing the task log page.
- The malicious script can potentially perform a variety of actions, such as:
   - Stealing session cookies
   - Redirecting to phishing sites
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to somehow influence the `host` field data that gets displayed on the task log page.  This suggests that the data source for this field might be user-controllable or vulnerable to injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious data into the `host` field. This could be through direct manipulation of a database, a related API, or other methods that allow setting the value of the `host` data.
- No special privileges are mentioned, implying that a low-privileged user or an unauthenticated user could be the attacker based on how the data source is affected by attacker-controlled inputs.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported by `retnullyu` in issue #362 of the `ouqiang/gocron` repository.
- Proof of concept images were provided as part of the report.
- This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-40365 in the Go vulnerability database.
