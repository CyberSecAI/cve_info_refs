- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JT files, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists during the parsing of JT files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious JT file to the user, either through a malicious web page or by convincing the user to open the file.
