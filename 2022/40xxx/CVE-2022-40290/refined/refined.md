- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application's barcode generation functionality is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can generate malicious links. If a user clicks on these links, their system could be compromised.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the barcode generation functionality, where malicious scripts can be injected.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and needs to craft a malicious URL using the vulnerable barcode generation feature, which they then need to deliver to victims.
