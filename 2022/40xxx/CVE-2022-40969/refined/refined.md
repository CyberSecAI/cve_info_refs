- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `delfile.cgi` script takes an unsanitized `_filename` parameter from an HTTP request and uses it in a `system()` call. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution on the device. The provided proof of concept demonstrates a device reboot, but more complex commands can be executed.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/delfile.cgi` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device and have valid basic authentication credentials.
