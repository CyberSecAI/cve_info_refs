  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of X_B files, which can lead to a write past the end of an allocated data structure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data when parsing X_B files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by having a user open a malicious X_B file or visit a malicious web page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious X_B file or a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction (opening a file or visiting a webpage) is required to exploit the vulnerability."
