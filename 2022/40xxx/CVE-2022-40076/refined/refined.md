The provided content is related to CVE-2022-40076.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `fromSetWifiGusetBasic` function within the `/bin/httpd` file of the Tenda AC21 (V16.03.08.15) firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` to copy data from a variable `v7` to a stack-allocated variable `v12` without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates that sending a crafted HTTP POST request with an oversized `shareSpeed` parameter can trigger a buffer overflow, leading to a crash (reboot) of the `httpd` process. This can result in denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP POST requests to the `/goform/WifiGuestSet` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is `shareSpeed`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Tenda AC21 router.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.
