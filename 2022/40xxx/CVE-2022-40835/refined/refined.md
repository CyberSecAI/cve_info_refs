Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of unsanitized user input as database field names within the `_wh()`, `_where_in()`, and `_like()` functions of the CodeIgniter framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct injection of user-controlled data into SQL queries as field names. This bypasses input validation and escaping mechanisms designed for values, allowing an attacker to manipulate the structure and logic of the SQL query itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially perform a variety of attacks, including bypassing authentication, data exfiltration, data modification or even deletion.
- **Authentication Bypass:**  The discussion references a YouTube video by LiveOverflow showing a similar issue in CodeIgniter 4 resulting in an authentication bypass. The issue is applicable to CI3 as well, though the discussion later points out that the root cause for the authentication bypass is actually in the application code (the controller's input validation) rather than in the framework's query builder.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User Input:**  The attack vector involves manipulating input parameters (e.g. GET parameters) that are used as database field names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the input that is used as database field names within the vulnerable CodeIgniter functions.
-  Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is not in the framework directly but occurs when developers fail to properly sanitize input used for field names when using CodeIgniter query builder functions.
- The use of `information_schema` as the main database in the provided example makes it easier to craft SQL injection attacks by accessing metadata.
-  The issue is not specific to CodeIgniter 3, since the same vulnerability class exists in CodeIgniter 4 according to the discussion.
- It's stressed that using user input as field identifiers is a bad practice.
- Prepared statements would not solve this issue as they do not work with field identifiers in this way.
