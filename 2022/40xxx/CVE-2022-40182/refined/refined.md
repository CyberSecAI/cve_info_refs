- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device's embedded Chromium-based browser is launched as root with the “–no-sandbox” option.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The browser is run with unnecessary root privileges and without sandboxing, which allows attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities within the browser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser, potentially leading to full compromise of the device due to the root privileges of the browser.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can add arbitrary JavaScript code inside “Operation” graphics, which will be executed by the vulnerable browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker can leverage this vulnerability.
