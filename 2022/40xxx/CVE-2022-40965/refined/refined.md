Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-40965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `PostEnergyType` API of the Delta Electronics DIAEnergie software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code, potentially leading to:
    *   Retrieval of sensitive information from the database.
    *   Modification of database content.
    *   Execution of system commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the `PostEnergyType` API.
*   The attack requires a low privileged user to interact with the system.
*   The attacker needs to inject malicious script through the vulnerable API, which will then be stored and executed when a user accesses the affected part of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires network access to the DIAEnergie system.
*   The attacker must have low-privileged user credentials.
*   The attacker needs to send a crafted request to the `PostEnergyType` API with malicious code to be stored.
