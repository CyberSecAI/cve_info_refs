{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the User Mode Hooking Monitor Engine, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information and potentially escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
