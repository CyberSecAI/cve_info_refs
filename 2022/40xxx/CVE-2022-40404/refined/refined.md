Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `select.php` file of the Wedding Planner v1.0 application. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided through the `id` parameter in the URL, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, including usernames, passwords, personal information, etc.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify, delete or add data in the database.
- **Database takeover:** A skilled attacker might also be able to take over the entire database, gaining complete control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious payload within the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the Wedding Planner application.
- No prior authentication is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The provided content also includes a sample HTTP request demonstrating the vulnerability and extracting the database name:
- The vulnerable URL is `/Wedding-Management-PHP/admin/select.php`.
- The payload `id=-1 union select 1,2,database(),4--+` is injected into the `id` parameter. This payload injects a SQL `UNION` clause which attempts to extract the database name.
- The request is sent using `POST` method, and the `Content-Type` is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
