- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtering of file content during upload in DedeCMS v5.7.98. Specifically, the blacklist of disallowed functions can be bypassed by encoding the malicious code and using `_COOKIE` instead of `_GET`, `_POST` or `_REQUEST`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Inadequate blacklist filtering in `uploadsafe.inc.php`.
    - Ability to bypass function blacklist using variable assignment and base64 encoding.
    - Unrestricted file upload allows for arbitrary PHP code injection.
    - Usage of `_COOKIE` bypasses blacklist restrictions on `_GET`,`_POST`,`_REQUEST`.
    - The function blacklist can be modified in the background, potentially creating further attack vectors.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote code execution (RCE) on the server.
    - Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to fully compromise the system.
    - Attackers can potentially gain full control over the web server and its data.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - File upload functionality in the `/dede/file_manage_control.php`
    - Maliciously crafted PHP file (`shell.php`).
    - Modification of the function blacklist.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Access to the DedeCMS administration panel (`/dede`).
    - Ability to upload files through the admin interface.
    - Knowledge of how to bypass the blacklist of functions.
