The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Leave Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `delete_leave_type` function within `/leave_system/classes/Master.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is susceptible to SQL injection because it directly incorporates the unsanitized `id` parameter into an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This allows for database information leakage (e.g., extracting the database name as shown in the payload).
- It could also lead to data modification or deletion, depending on the SQL injection payload used.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/leave_system/classes/Master.php` file, specifically within the `delete_leave_type` function.
- The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to `/leave_system/classes/Master.php?f=delete_leave_type` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
- No specific authentication is required to exploit the described SQLi.
- The provided exploit code and vulnerability description shows a direct connection to the exploitation of the vulnerability

**Additional details:**
- The provided exploit code includes an example using `updatexml` to extract the database name.
- The vulnerability can be accessed via an HTTP POST request, which includes the `id` parameter in the request body, alongside a typical web application cookie.
- The admin login credentials are also included as `admin/admin123`
