Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `delete_category` function within the `Master.php` file of the Online Pet Shop We App.
- The application does not properly sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `id` parameter, which is intended to be an integer, is directly incorporated into the SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input (`id`) before using it in database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as database names, table structures and content. The provided payload extracts the database name using `select database()`.
- **Data Manipulation:** It can be inferred that the attacker can use this vulnerability to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** In more complex SQL injection scenarios, this vulnerability can be used for more severe attacks including privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/pet_shop/classes/Master.php?f=delete_category` with a malicious `id` parameter in the request body.
- **Manipulated ID Parameter:** The attacker modifies the `id` parameter to include SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax and how to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **No Authentication Required**: The exploit occurs via the  `/pet_shop/classes/Master.php?f=delete_category` endpoint and the supplied credentials in the documentation `admin/admin123` are not required.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerable file is `/pet_shop/classes/Master.php`.
- The vulnerable function is `delete_category`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The provided payload demonstrates how to extract the database name: `id=4' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`

This analysis provides significantly more detail compared to a typical CVE description, including the specific file, function, and parameter involved, along with the exact payload used to exploit the vulnerability.
