6. Installation
========================================================================
This section explains the key steps for installing this product. For
detailed installation steps, refer to the "Installation and
Deployment Guide".
Mobile Security for Enterprise consists of four components:
- Mobile Security Management Server
- Mobile Security Communication Server
- Exchange Connector
- Mobile Device Agents (the Mobile Security clients)
Depending on your network topology and needs, you may install the
necessary components only.
Mobile Security Management Server
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mobile Security Management Server allows you to control Mobile Device
Agents from the administration Web console. Once mobile devices are
enrolled with the server, you can configure Mobile Device Agent
policies and perform updates.
Mobile Security Communication Server
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mobile Security Communication Server handles communications between
the Mobile Security Management Server and Mobile Device Agents.
Mobile Device Agents can connect to the public IP address of the
Communication Server.
Mobile Security for Enterprise supports two types of Communication
Servers: Local Communication Server (which is installed in the local
network) and the Cloud Communication Server (which is installed in
the cloud and maintained by Trend Micro.
Exchange Connector
---------------------------------------------------------------------
You can install Exchange Connector if you want to manage Android or
iOS mobile devices that use Exchange ActiveSync service.
Mobile Device Agent (Mobile Security Client)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Install the Mobile Device Agent (the Mobile Security client program)
on supported platforms using one of the following methods:
- Email notification
- Manual installation
NOTES:
- On a web browser where you have accessed Trend Micro Mobile
Security web console, clear the web browser cache after upgrading
to Mobile Security 9.8 SP5 Critical Patch 2.
- Trend Micro cannot guarantee compatibility between Mobile Security
and file system encryption software. Software products that offer
similar features, such as anti-malware scanning, SMS management,
and firewall protection, may also be incompatible with Mobile
Security. You may be prompted to uninstall these software products
before you can install Mobile Security on your mobile device.
7. Post-Installation Configuration
========================================================================
Refer to the "Administrator's Guide" for the post-installation
configuration.
8. Known Issues
========================================================================
Known issues in this release:
8.1 The status of a mobile device that is displayed in the Mobile
Security server does not switch to "Inactive", even after:
- the Android Mobile Device Agent is uninstalled.
- the iOS "MDM Enrollment Profile" is removed from the mobile device.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This can happen if the Android Mobile Device Agent is uninstalled or
the iOS "MDM Enrollment Profile" is removed from the mobile device
when it was not connected to the network. As a result, the Mobile
Security server keeps displaying the mobile device in the Device list
even after the Mobile Security client is uninstalled on the mobile
device. However, the mobile device status changes to "Out of Sync".
8.2 The Exchange ActiveSync provisioning policy does not contain user
name and email address information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This happens if the user name or email address is not configured
for the iOS mobile device. To resolve this issue, configure the
Active Directory from "Administrator > Active Directory Settings",
and then add the user from the Active Directory again.
8.3 Mobile Security is unable to read the phone number from Android
mobile devices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mobile Security requires the default Android API to read the phone
number from the mobile device. If the mobile device does not use the
default Android API, Mobile Security is unable to read the phone
number. This can also happen if the phone number is not stored on the
operator's database instead of the SIM card.
8.4 Users are unable to upgrade from the non-customized application
package to a customized application package.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the customized and non-customized application packages use
different certificates for authentication, the non-customized
application package cannot be upgraded to the customized one, or vice
versa. To resolve this issue, manually remove Mobile Security from
the mobile phone and then install the customized application package.
8.5 Sometimes the Android or iOS mobile device agents do not receive
the policy update and/or remote lock/wipe/locate instruction from the
server.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If the network connection between the client and the server is not
stable, this known issue may occur.
8.6 Sometimes an Android mobile device using Exchange ActiveSync
does not display the correct status in Exchange ActiveSync Devices
tab in Mobile Security.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This happens if the Mobile Security Management Server is unable to
get the correct mobile device identity from the Exchange Server.
8.7 The Mobile Device Agents are sometimes unable to connect to the
Cloud Communication Server (CCS).
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mobile Device Agents connect with the Cloud Communication Server
through the Internet. This known issue may occur if the connection
between the mobile device and the Cloud Communication Server is not
stable.
8.8 Microsoft Internet Explorer(TM) crashes while using Trend Micro
Mobile Security administration web console.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If the Mobile Security administration web console is not closed on
Internet Explorer for some time (depending on the memory size),
memory leak occurs and causes Internet Explorer to crash.
For details, refer to the following link:
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982094/en-us
8.9 Mobile Security displays the Exchange Connector status as
Connected, even when the Exchange Connector is uninstalled from the
computer. Moreover, Mobile Security is unable to reinstall the
Exchange Connector because the setup program is unable to connect to
the Mobile Security server.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This happens when the Exchange Connector is uninstalled while it is
disconnected from the Mobile Security Management Server. The
Management Server is unable to receive the uninstallation
notification from the Exchange Connector, and therefore displays the
wrong status.
If the Mobile Security displays the Exchange Connector status as
Connected, it will not connect to another Exchange Connector.
To resolve this known issue:
1. Log on to the Mobile Security administration web console.
2. Using the same web browser, open the following URL:
https://:/mdm/cgi/web\_service.dll?
tmms\_action=mdm\_register\_new\_connector
3. Replace  and  with the actual Mobile Security
Management Server host name/IP address and port number.
4. Press "Enter".
The following message should appear.
{ "error\_code" : 1, "message" : "Success", "timestamp" : xxxxxxxxxx }
Where, xxxxxxxxxx displays the current timestamp.
After performing the above steps, Mobile Security will reset the
Exchange Server Integration settings, and you should be able to
install the Exchange Connector.
8.10 Unable to access some external web services when Trend Micro
Mobile Security is deployed in pure IPv6 environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This happens when the external web services do not support IPv6.
8.11 Unable to access SMTP server or Active Directory when Management
Server connects these servers using IPv6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Management Server is unable to access the SMTP Server or Active
Directory when using IPv6.
8.12 Sometimes, iOS Mobile Device Agents are unable to enroll with
the Mobile Security server.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This happens when the SCEP server uses IPv6 numeric address to enroll
iOS mobile devices. To resolve this known issue, configure SCEP using
the domain name on Mobile Security Web console.
8.13 Mobile Security is unable to remove Microsoft Exchange email
account on some mobile devices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue occurs when performing selective wipe on mobile
devices running Android 5.0 or later, because of limitations in the
operating system.
8.14 Mobile Security is unable to run a cloud scan and perform policy
updates on Android devices that are on battery save mode.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue affects devices running on Android 5.0 or later.
When the device is on battery save mode, the network connection
is disabled and Mobile Security is unable to run a cloud scan
or perform policy updates.
8.15 Mobile Security is unable to acquire the Bluetooth MAC addresses
of mobile devices running Android 6.0 or later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue occurs because of limitations on the operating
system. As a result, Mobile Security does not display the Bluetooth
MAC addresses of affected devices on Mobile Security web console.
8.16 Mobile Security is unable to acquire the Wi-Fi MAC addresses or
IMEI of mobile devices running Android 7.0 or later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue occurs because of limitations on the operating
system. As a result, Mobile Security does not display the IMEI or
Wi-Fi MAC addresses of affected devices on Mobile Security web
console.
8.17 Devices running Android 7.0 or later do not show the correct
encryption status when the devices use Pattern mode as screen lock
type.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue occurs because of limitations on the Android 7.0
operating system.
8.18 Mobile Security is unable to reset the password of mobile
devices running Android 7.0 or later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue occurs because of limitations on the Android 7.0
operating system.
8.19 Trend Micro Mobile Device Agent can be disabled for realtime
scan on Android 8.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue occurs because of limitations on the Android 8.0
operating system.
This known issue occurs when performing system setting: Settings ->
Apps & Notifications -> App info -> TMMS -> Battery -> Turn OFF
Background activity on Android 8.
On turning off the background activity, the Mobile Device Agent will
be automatically stopped by the operating system, and therefore,
cannot perform realtime scan.
8.20 Trend Micro Mobile Device Agent cannot display Wi-Fi MAC address
on Android mobile devices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue occurs because of limitations on the Android 8.0
operating system. Therefore, the Mobile Device Agent cannot display
the Wi-Fi MAC address on the About screen.
8.21 Mobile Security does not detect malicious iOS profiles on
iOS 11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This known issue occurs because of limitations on the iOS 11.0
operating system.

for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this

3 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.
3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
However, You may include an additional document offering the additional
rights described in Section 3.5.
3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial
Developer in Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the
License.
3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
ownership of the Covered Code.
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
(a) Third Party Claims.
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
knowledge has been obtained.
(b) Contributor APIs.
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
include this information in the LEGAL file.
(c) Representations.
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.
You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code.
You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
this License and that the license for the Executable version does not
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you
distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a
product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation
and/or other materials provided with the product.
3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
3.8. Restrictions.
You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary
notices or labels from gSOAP.
4 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included
in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
6 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.
6.1. New Versions.
Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
6.2. Effect of New Versions.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License.
6.3. Derivative Works.
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
phrase "gSOAP" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and
(b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains
terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name
of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)
