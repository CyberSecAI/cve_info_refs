The provided content describes a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the Tenda AC21 router firmware.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `fromSetSysTime` function, specifically in the `sub_496104` function, due to the use of `sscanf` without proper bounds checking on the input which gets stored in stack variables `v6` and `v7`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow. The `sscanf` function is used to parse input without adequate size checks leading to the overflow when processing the `timeZone` parameter.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the device.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetSysTimeCfg` endpoint. The `timeZone` parameter is used to exploit the overflow.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the router to send the malicious HTTP request. They must also have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter. Additionally, it seems authentication is required based on the cookie parameter in the provided exploit.
