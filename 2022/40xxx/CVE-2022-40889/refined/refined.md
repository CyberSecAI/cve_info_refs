The provided content describes a vulnerability in phpok version 6.1+, specifically an insecure deserialization issue that can lead to arbitrary file write, and thus, remote code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data in `/framework/phpok_call.php` within the `_format_ext_all` function.
- The application uses `parse_str` to process user-supplied input which can be manipulated via double url encoding and then passed to `unserialize`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization: The application deserializes data without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
- Use of `parse_str`: This function is used on input that is later deserialized.
- Lack of input validation: The application fails to validate the data before deserialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file write: An attacker can write arbitrary files to the server by controlling the serialized data, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Remote code execution: By writing a malicious PHP file (webshell) to the server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `api.php` with a specific `c` and `f` parameters, containing the malicious serialized data in the `data` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `api.php` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to craft a valid serialized PHP object of the class `cache` with malicious content in the `key_list` property, using rot13 encoding, to be able to bypass alias check during deserialization.
- No prior authentication needed.
