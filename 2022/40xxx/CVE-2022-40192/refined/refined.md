- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress versions <= 2.0.9 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious request, an attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions they didn't intend to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to interact with the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
