**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a result of missing or inadequate CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the wpForo Forum plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The attack relies on the user being logged into their WordPress account while accessing the malicious content or clicking the crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
