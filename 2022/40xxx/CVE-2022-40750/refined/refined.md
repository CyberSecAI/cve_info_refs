- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Admin Console's Application Migration Report function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This implies that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed in the web application, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser when they access the Admin Console, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to inject malicious code via the Application Migration Report function in the Admin Console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to introduce malicious script in the Application Migration Report function. This implies that the attacker might need to have some level of legitimate access to the application or be able to trick a user with such access into executing malicious code, by for example preparing a malicious report and tricking the user into viewing it.
