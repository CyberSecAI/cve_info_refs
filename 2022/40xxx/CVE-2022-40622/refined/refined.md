Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered in the Wavelink router, as presented in the YouTube video:

**1. Credential Replay**

*   **Root Cause:** The device uses a client-side generated key (salt) for password hashing, instead of a server-generated one. The server only checks if the received MD5 hash matches the stored hash, without validating the key's uniqueness or freshness.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of server-side key generation, reliance on client-provided key. No check for replay attacks.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can capture a valid login request (including the client-generated key and the resulting MD5 hash), and reuse it to gain unauthorized access to the admin interface, even without knowing the actual password.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network sniffing to intercept a valid login attempt.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to intercept network traffic, no special privileges or device access is required.

**2. Authentication Bypass**

*   **Root Cause:** The router uses the client's IP address as the sole identifier for a logged-in session.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure session management. The system trusts the client-supplied IP address for session validation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker on the same network or behind the same NAT can gain access to the administrator interface, simply by browsing to specific pages, if another user has already logged in using the same public IP. Attackers can also spoof their IP address or use scripts to maintain the session alive.
*  **Attack Vector:** An attacker behind the same NAT or using IP spoofing to match the admin's public IP.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to manipulate their IP address or be on the same network as an admin user.

**3. Improper Access Control**

*   **Root Cause:** Certain CGI scripts, such as `export_logs.sh`, are accessible without any authentication checks.
*  **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper access control on sensitive resources.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can download sensitive information, including system logs that contain the administrator's username and password in plain text.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the unauthenticated CGI script via the web interface using `/cgi-bin/export_logs.sh`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required.

**4. Command Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `set_nas` function takes user-supplied input for the NAS username and directly passes it to the `system()` function without sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, use of the `system()` function with user-controlled data.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject arbitrary shell commands and execute them on the device with root privileges, compromising the system entirely.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/cgi-bin/set_nas` with malicious commands embedded in the NAS username.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires authentication.

**5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The web interface does not use any anti-CSRF tokens to validate requests.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of CSRF protection, making the device vulnerable to cross-site attacks.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can craft malicious web pages that, when visited by an authenticated user, trigger unwanted actions on the router, such as executing commands (e.g., the command injection vulnerability mentioned above).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious website or email with embedded links or scripts.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the user to be authenticated on the router and tricked into visiting the malicious page.

**6. Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (Firmware)**

*  **Root Cause:** The device only checks for the correct magic number when upgrading firmware. It does not perform any additional checks (like cryptographic signature verification) to ensure the firmware's authenticity.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of firmware verification, reliance on a simple magic number check.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can upload malicious firmware, potentially gaining full control of the device.
*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading malicious firmware via the web interface.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to access the firmware update page, and the ability to craft a valid firmware image with a valid magic number.

**7. Hard-Coded Cryptographic Password**

*   **Root Cause:** The device uses a hard-coded password (`803f5d`) to encrypt the configuration backup file.
*   **Weaknesses:** Hard-coded cryptographic key for sensitive information, use of weak encryption.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can decrypt the configuration backup and obtain sensitive information, including the administrator credentials and network passwords, using the known hard-coded password.
*   **Attack Vector:** Download the backup file through the web interface. Then, decrypt the backup file using the hardcoded password.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires access to a backup file, which can be obtained with admin credentials or through social engineering.

**8. Vulnerable Lighttpd Version**

*   **Root Cause:** The device uses a vulnerable version of Lighttpd (1.4.35).
*   **Weaknesses:** Outdated software, known vulnerabilities present in the web server.
*    **Impact:** Although the presenter didn't detect a specific impact on the device, this version of lighttpd is vulnerable to integer overflow and directory traversal attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the known vulnerabilities present in the outdated web server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the vulnerabilities and an understanding of how to exploit them.
