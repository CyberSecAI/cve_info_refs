### **[di1l0o](/di1l0o)** commented [Sep 13, 2022](#issue-1371539106)

| We discovered a potential code execution backdoor in version 0.1.0 of the project, the backdoor is the democritus-hypothesis package. Attackers can upload democritus-hypothesis packages containing arbitrary malicious code. For the safety of this project, the democritus-hypothesis package has been uploaded by us.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58363074/189925750-0924ae6c-1e40-4546-b4ad-f381eba8c0a7.png)  The democritus-hypothesis package can be successfully installed using `pip install d8s-uuids==0.1.0`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58363074/189926274-4a4545fa-3078-4370-947d-4caf2b4d604e.png)  Suggestion: remove version 0.1.0 of this project in PyPI |
