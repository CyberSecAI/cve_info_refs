- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM DataPower Gateway does not invalidate existing active sessions after a user password is changed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to invalidate active sessions on password change.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A session created using a compromised password could continue to operate after the password has been changed, until the session expires. This could allow an attacker with a compromised password to maintain access even after the password has been changed.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with a compromised password for an IBM DataPower Gateway user could maintain access even after the password is changed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have obtained a valid user password before it was changed by the legitimate user.
