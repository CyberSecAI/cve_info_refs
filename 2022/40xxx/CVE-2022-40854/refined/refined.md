- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function, where the program copies the value of the "ssid" parameter to stack buffers (`acStack128` and `acStack192`) using `strcpy` without any size checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow due to the usage of `strcpy` without any bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overflowing the stack with carefully crafted malicious data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint with a long `ssid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router's web interface. They need to know the target URL endpoint (`/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set`) and need to be able to authenticate if required to access the vulnerable function.
