MetaDefender ICAP Server
# MetaDefender ICAP Server™

## Advanced Threat Prevention for Network Traffic

MetaDefender ICAP Server is a plug-and-play solution to protect your network against malicious internet content.

[Download Product Datasheet](https://static.opswat.com/uploads/files/opswat-metadefender-icap-server-datasheet.pdf)ChallengeSolutionHow it WorksBenefitsDeploymentUse CasesResourcesGet StartedChallenge
## Relentless Malware Threats

Cybercriminals relentlessly attempt to upload malware to your systems, while employees accidentally visit malicious websites or download harmful files and vulnerable software from the internet.

To protect against these threats, enterprises need a powerful multi-layered cybersecurity system to prevent harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content from infecting their networks.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)Solution
## Protects Your Systems and Users

MetaDefender ICAP Server protects your systems and users by inspecting every file traveling through your network. Every file is scanned for malware and vulnerabilities.

* With custom policies and workflows, suspicious files can be blocked or deeply sanitized.
* Sensitive information is filtered, removed, or redacted before leaving your network.
* All files are inspected and sanitized before they are accessible to the end users.
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

* ![](data:image/svg+xml...)

  ”The performance got better with MetaDefender ICAP. We got some great feedback from our system engineers, who are now transferring more files in a shorter time span.”

  Ronny QuerfurthConsultant on IT Solutions and Platforms, Berlin Brandenburg Airport[Read the Blog](https://www.opswat.com/blog/how-berlin-airport-is-securing-critical-infrastructure-against-cyberattacks)
* ![](data:image/svg+xml...)

  “The MetaDefender Platform provides Swiss Re with a comprehensive, easy-to-deploy and maintain solution that meets regulatory compliance requirements and eliminates the risk of malware entering the organization.”

  Raymond BucherDirector/Cloud Architect, Swiss Re
How It Works
## How MetaDefender ICAP Server Works

MetaDefender ICAP Server provides an ICAP interface on top of our advanced threat prevention solution, [MetaDefender Core](/products/metadefender/core). Any content routed through the ICAP interface will be scanned and processed before entering your network and reaching end users.

MetaDefender ICAP Server can seamlessly integrate with any ICAP-enabled network appliances, including reverse proxies, web application firewalls, load balancers, forward proxies, web gateways, SSL inspectors, etc.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

* ![](data:image/svg+xml...)

  “With OPSWAT, we are assured that our data is secure, and our files are malware free.”

  Omer KeidarHead of Critical Infrastructure and Cyber, Clalit Health Services[Read the Blog](https://www.opswat.com/blog/world-leading-healthcare-provider-protects-its-network-from-cyberthreats-with-opswat)
* ![](data:image/svg+xml...)

  “As part of our evaluation, we were looking for a provider that supported both the REST interface and ICAP. We then carried out a POC and found that OPSWAT was the right choice, and only provider that supported this.”

  Cihan BalSoftware Engineer, LLB[Read the Blog](https://www.opswat.com/blog/opswat-eliminates-a-file-upload-security-risk-for-major-european-bank)
