Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of the pfBlockerNG package for pfSense. Specifically, the code uses the `exec()` function with unsanitized user input from the `Host` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unsanitized Input:** The `d_query` variable, derived from the `Host` header, is directly inserted into a shell command without proper sanitization or escaping.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The `exec()` function in PHP allows execution of arbitrary shell commands. Because of the unsanitized user input, an attacker can inject malicious commands to be executed on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the pfSense firewall, potentially gaining complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is via crafted HTTP requests to the `index.php` page.
- **Host Header Injection:** The malicious payload is inserted into the `Host` header of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the pfSense web interface, which is usually on the LAN side or a designated management network.
- **HTTP Client:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
// Query for a TLD Block
if (empty($pfb_query)) {
	$idparts	= explode('.', $query);
	$idcnt		= (count($idparts) -1);

	for ($i=1; $i <= $idcnt; $i++) {
		$d_query = implode('.', array_slice($idparts, -$i, $i, TRUE));
		exec("/usr/bin/grep -l '^{$d_query}$' /var/db/pfblockerng/dnsblalias/DNSBL_TLD", $match);

		if (!empty($match[0])) {
			$pfb_query = 'DNSBL_TLD';
			break;
		}
	}
}
```

The critical line is: `exec("/usr/bin/grep -l '^{$d_query}$' /var/db/pfblockerng/dnsblalias/DNSBL_TLD", $match);`

The `$d_query` variable takes data directly from the HTTP Host header and is used in the shell command via `exec()` without sanitization which enables the attacker to inject malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is in versions of pfBlockerNG prior to 2.1.4_27.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) request demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a payload such as `' *; sleep 5; '` in the `Host` header.
- The provided GitHub repository was created to demonstrate the vulnerability and to show that SAST tools are able to find such vulnerabilities.
