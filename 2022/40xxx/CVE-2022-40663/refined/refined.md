{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of TIF images. Crafted data in a TIF image can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must open a malicious TIF file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious TIF file. User interaction is required to open the file."
