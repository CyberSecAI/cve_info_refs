Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input sanitization on the `errorMsg` parameter in the `OnlinePreviewController.java` file. This parameter, which is user-controllable, is directly used in the frontend error message without proper filtering or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Since the `errorMsg` is not sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when the error page is rendered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Website cookies leakage:** An attacker can potentially steal website cookies by injecting malicious JavaScript that extracts the cookie data.
- **Arbitrary code execution:**  The injected JavaScript can be used to perform a wide range of malicious activities in the context of the user's browser, such as redirecting the user to a malicious website, modifying content, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL, embedding JavaScript code within the `url` parameter after base64 and URL encoding, which will be decoded and used as part of the error message.
- **User interaction:** The victim needs to be lured into clicking the malicious URL. This could be through social engineering, phishing campaigns, or through compromised links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** An attacker needs to be able to create a URL containing a payload after base64 and URL encoding to pass through the vulnerable parameter.
- **Ability to deliver the malicious URL to the victim:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click the malicious link.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 4.1.0 and also persists in version 4.3.0 of `kkFileView`, based on the comments.
- The fix suggested in the comments involves using `HtmlUtils.htmlEscape()` to encode the `errMsg` parameter to prevent XSS attacks, which is a standard way to sanitize user input that goes into HTML context.
- The provided PoC URL `https://file.keking.cn/onlinePreview?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmFpZHUuPGltZyBzcmM9MSBvbmVycm9yPWFsZXJ0KDEpPg==` demonstrates how to inject the javascript to trigger the vulnerability.
