Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `formSetDeviceName` function of the `/bin/httpd` binary within Tenda AC21 firmware (V16.03.08.15).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `sprintf` function in the `set_device_name` function copies the `devName` parameter (obtained via a POST request) into a stack-allocated buffer (`v4`) without proper bounds checking.
- **Uncontrolled String Copy:** The `sprintf(v4, "%s;1", a1)` call allows an attacker to provide an overly long `devName` value to overflow the `v4` buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted POST request with an oversized `devName` parameter, the attacker can cause the `httpd` process to crash, leading to a denial of service. The provided content specifically mentions this as the effect of successful exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/SetOnlineDevName` endpoint.
- **`devName` Parameter:** The attacker controls the size of the string sent as the `devName` parameter within the POST request's body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Tenda AC21 router. This likely implies they are on the same network (LAN) or have access to the router's web interface.
- No special authentication or privileges are explicitly mentioned as a requirement to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable function is `formSetDeviceName` which calls `set_device_name`.
- The overflowing buffer `v4` is allocated on the stack.
- The provided POC demonstrates the exploitation by sending a string of "a" characters for the `devName` parameter.
- The firmware version is specifically mentioned as Tenda AC21(V16.03.08.15).
