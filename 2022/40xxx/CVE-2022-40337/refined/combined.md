# Open Aviation Strategic Engineering System

## Clarity in action

Aviation engineering and maintenance systems are designed to make things clear; the very next responsibility, priority, task, and action.

Sometimes – due to the complex workflows they absorb, drive, connect, and direct – they are just too clever.

Sophisticated software is one thing, but usability and clarity are something else entirely.

If maintenance actions are not driven by expediency, communicated through connected devices as and when necessary, they stack up.

If they’re not defined by compliance, they back up.

If they lack the right data at the right time, they mash up.

### COMPLY

Airworthiness processes planned, executed, accelerated, logged, and automatically captured for compliance monitoring and reporting.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#continuingairworthiness)

### INTEGRATE PLANNING

Work packages automatically generated with necessary documentation and material pre-loads to ensure timely completion of all maintenance tasks, modifications and defect limitations.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#planning)

### TRACK PRODUCTION IN REAL-TIME

Works orders tracked in real-time through the hangar or MRO facility; reporting enables you to compare budget to actual costs, see defects raised, status of any task at any given time, and details on all materials used or returned.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#production)

### IMPROVE LINE MAINTENANCE

Integrating data feeds from EFB, ETL, e-enabled aircraft and electronic operations systems, OASES enables control of short-term maintenance planning, aircraft defects and the materials required to support rectification.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#linemaintenance)

### MAINTENANCE CONTROL

Protect your flight schedule: Monitor status, identify maintenance slots, allocate requisite resources and materials, and manage work orders all from one screen, with easy colour-coding and total user flexibility.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#maintenancecontrol)

### MASTER YOUR INVENTORY

Control all material requirements, ensuring parts availability at moment of need, and replenishment or repair when required. All stock is visible in the system at all times; enabling cost-effective multi- locations inventory management.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#materialmanagement)

### EXPEDITE INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS

Confidently record all requisite customs information, pertinent to the entire journey of parts across international borders; capturing data from the moment goods are cleared at customs through to their receipt at the warehouse.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#customstracking)

### STREAMLINE BILLING

Track and invoice for all labour and materials associated with third party work. Invoice against complex customer models, which can be tailored to match individual contracts or aircraft packages.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#commercialmanagement)

### OPTIMISE VENDOR SUPPORT

Ensure warranty claims on both the aircraft and parts in the inventory are never missed or allowed to lapse.
Claims are identified and made for the part as soon as it is booked into stores in an un-serviceable condition.
[READ MORE](https://www.oases.aero/oases-modules/#warrantymanagement)

### MAKE IT YOUR OWN

Rapidly roll out new interfaces and other developments by directly harnessing OASES’ extensive business logic. (The OASES API is an industry standard securely encrypted RESTful HTTPS API fully described by a Swagger UI).
