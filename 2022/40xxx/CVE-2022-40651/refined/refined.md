- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of X_B files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a write past the end of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious X_B file or visits a malicious page that contains such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious X_B file to the target user. This can be achieved through social engineering (e.g., tricking the user to open a file) or by hosting it on a malicious website. User interaction is required for exploitation.
