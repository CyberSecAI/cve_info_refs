- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing BMP images, specifically before copying it to a heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by visiting a malicious webpage or by opening a malicious BMP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious BMP file or host a malicious web page with a crafted BMP that is processed by the vulnerable software. User interaction is required as the target must either open the malicious file or visit a malicious page.
