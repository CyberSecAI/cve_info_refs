## Description

![@c01dkit](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62790045?u=e5de5725ea146a5b4ac6012710a694ec0b710c22&v=4&size=48)[c01dkit](https://github.com/c01dkit)opened [on Sep 16, 2022](https://github.com/Samsung/mTower/issues/80#issue-1376002655)

**Affected components：**

affected source code file: /tee/lib/libutee/tee\_api\_objects.c, affected functions: TEE\_MACCompareFinal

**Attack vector(s)**

To exploit the vulnerability, invoke the function TEE\_MACCompareFinal and pass a NULL pointer to the parameter "operation".

**Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE**

Null pointer dereference vulnerablity in TEE\_MACCompareFinal function in Samsung Electronics mTower v0.3.0 (and earlier) allows a trusted application to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) via invoking the function TEE\_MACCompareFinal with a Null pointer of the parameter "operation".

**Discoverer(s)/Credits**

SyzTrust

**Reference(s)**

[mTower/tee/lib/libutee/tee\_api\_operations.c](https://github.com/Samsung/mTower/blob/efd36709306a9afcca5b4782499d01be0c7a02a5/tee/lib/libutee/tee_api_operations.c#L1249)

Line 1249
in
[efd3670](/Samsung/mTower/commit/efd36709306a9afcca5b4782499d01be0c7a02a5)

|  | if (operation->info.operationClass != TEE\_OPERATION\_MAC) { |
| --- | --- |

**Additional information**

The TEE\_MACCompareFinal function takes a pointer "operation". This value is passed by TA, and TEE\_MACCompareFinal does not check whether it is a null pointer or not. Executing the statement "if (operation->info.operationClass != TEE\_OPERATION\_MAC)" later will crash the trusted execution environment kernel and cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

*THANK YOU FOR CONTRIBUTIONS IN MTOWER TEE OS!*
