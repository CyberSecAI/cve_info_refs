Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-40841:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `NdkAdvancedCustomizationFields` Prestashop module fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `htmlNodes` parameter when processing image previews in `showPreview.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The module directly reflects the unsanitized `htmlNodes` parameter back into the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page by crafting a malicious URL.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Cookie theft, session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `htmlNodes` parameter containing the XSS payload.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must click on the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and disseminate a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker does not need any prior access to the target system or application.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a web browser.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `showPreview.php` of the `ndk_advanced_custom_fields` module.
- The vulnerable parameter is `htmlNodes`.
- The exploit is triggered by requesting a URL like `http://localhost/modules/ndk_advanced_custom_fields/showPreview.php?htmlNodes=<script>alert('xss')</script>`.

**Additional notes:**
- The module version affected is 3.5.0 and possibly earlier versions.
- The provided exploit code uses a simple alert box as a proof-of-concept. However, a real attack can use more sophisticated payloads.
