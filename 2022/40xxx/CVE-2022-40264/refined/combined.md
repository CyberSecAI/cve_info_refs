## 4. MITIGATIONS

ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend updating the ICONICS Suite software with the [latest security patches when available](https://iconics.force.com/community/s/login/?language=en_US&ec=302&startURL=%2Fcommunity%2Fs%2Fresource-center%2Fsoftware-updates) (login required). Security updates are released as critical fixes or rollup releases.

ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend users take the following mitigation steps:

* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from untrusted networks and hosts.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the internet.
* Avoid clicking on web links in emails or opening email attachments from untrusted sources.
* For systems without patches or fixes, users should:
  + Only unpack files received from trusted sources.
  + Protect and encrypt Pack&Go packages with a password to prevent modifications by untrustworthy users.
  + Avoid unpacking a Pack&Go package file using a relative path (Note: this would show in the Workbench UI).

Users should refer to the [ICONICS whitepaper on security vulnerabilities](https://iconics.com/About/Security/CERT) for information on security update availability.

Refer to the [Mitsubishi Electric advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2022-014_en.pdf) for further details and instructions for determining installed versions.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

# SECURITY UPDATES

ICONICS is committed to providing high-quality, secure products to its customers. To that end, ICONICS recommends that users of the ICONICS Suite, GENESIS64, Hyper Historian, AnalytiX, GENESIS32, BizViz, OPC Servers, or other ICONICS products take the following steps to mitigate security risks:

* Use a firewall. Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF).  Place control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* Restrict access to all TCP ports, such as port 38080 and 6002. If remote access is required, utilize secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet.
* Minimize the attack surface by turning off services and point managers which you are not going to use in the project.
* If you are not running the latest version of ICONICS software, install the appropriate patch files listed in our Security Vulnerabilities Whitepapers below.

## WHITEPAPER ON SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

A whitepaper is available for download that contains an overview, details and mitigation plan regarding previously identified ICS-CERT vulnerabilities for ICONICS GENESIS64 and GENESIS32 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) products.

[Download the GENESIS64 Security Vulnerabilities Whitepaper here](https://go.iconics.com/Security-Vulnerabilities-Whitepaper-GENESIS64) for more information on GENESIS64.

[Download the GENESIS32 Security Vulnerabilities Whitepaper here](https://go.iconics.com/Security-Vulnerabilities-Whitepaper-GENESIS32) for more information on GENESIS32.

## SECURITY PATCHES

Please consult our Security Vulnerabilities Whitepapers above to learn how to mitigate vulnerabilities for your specific version. Access to download patches is available by logging into the [ICONICS Customer Connection Portal](https://partners.iconics.com) or [ICONICS Community Portal](https://iconics.force.com/community) using a SupportWorX plan number.

## ICS CERT

ICONICS works closely with the ICS CERT program operated by the CISA division of the United States Department of Homeland Security <https://us-cert.cisa.gov/>.

As a result of this cooperation, identified security vulnerabilities are posted on the CERT website with documentation on the vulnerability as well as the means of mitigation. ICONICS makes security patches available to users as necessary in order to mitigate any identified vulnerabilities.
