  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Inconsistent data in instruction and data cache when creating WASM code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper synchronization between instruction and data caches on ARM64 architecture when creating WebAssembly (WASM) code."
    ],
    "impact": "Potentially exploitable crash due to stale instruction cache leading to the execution of unexpected code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation of inconsistent cache data by manipulating WASM code creation and execution.",
      "Executing stale instruction cache content to potentially gain control over the execution flow of the application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to trigger WASM code compilation and execution.",
      "Requires the application to run on ARM64 platforms."
    ],
     "additional_details": "The issue arises when WASM code is compiled or deserialized on a different thread than it is executed on. The ARM64 architecture requires explicit synchronization to ensure instruction and data cache coherency. The fix involves performing a 'context synchronization operation' using an `isb` instruction when a module is received from another thread and ensuring that the instruction cache is properly flushed when WASM code is generated. This is done to avoid stale data in the instruction cache."
