## Web developers love ProcessWire

* [### Simple

  Whether working in the admin or from the API, ProcessWire is always easy and intuitive. It’s powerfully engineered while always remaining simple to use.](about/what/#simple)* [### Powerful

    ProcessWire is like a power tool for your website, able to deliver any output, to any number of people, while remaining incredibly fast and flexible.](about/what/#capable)* [### Best API

      The best and most powerful API in its class, while also the simplest to learn and use. Any bit of content in your entire site is less than 1 line of code away. It’s easy.](docs/start/api/)* [### Enjoyable

        Something we hear over and over is how much fun it is to develop websites in ProcessWire. It makes previously difficult projects easy, enjoyable and just plain fun.](about/what/#easy-and-enjoyable-to-develop-with)* [### Scalable

          ProcessWire is designed to scale. It remains solid and fast powering everything from small 1-pagers to websites with millions of pages/URLs.](about/what/#highly-scalable-on-sites-big-and-small)* [### Familiar

            ProcessWire works the way you do, seamlessly integrating into your existing development tools and processes. There’s no new template system to learn either, it’s pure API goodness.](about/what/#its-already-familiar-to-developers)* [### Stable

              ProcessWire has been in continuous development since 2006 (since 2010 as open source), has weekly new versions, and is a mature and exceptionally stable platform.](about/what/#proven-stability)* [### Friendly

                Welcome home! The ProcessWire community is the friendliest and most knowledgeable group of people you’ll find in any CMS project. We love to use ProcessWire and love to help others use it too.](about/what/#the-best-community-and-support)

## Building websites with a CMS has never been more simple and fun

```
// Render your site’s primary navigation
echo $pages->get('/')->children->each('<li><a href={url}>{title}</a>');
```
```
// Find buildings: built before 1950, 10+ floors, sort by height
$pages->find('template=building, year<1950, floors>=10, sort=height');
```
```
// Output field “headline” when present or “title” if not
echo '<h1>' . $page->get('headline|title') . '</h1>';
```
```
// Get “email” field from /contact/ page and use it in link
<a href='mailto:<?= $pages->get('/contact/')->email ?>'>Email</a>
```
```
// Output first “images” field item on page at 90px width
<img src='<?= $page->images->first->width(90)->url ?>'>
```
```
// Set “headline” field value on page and save to database
$page->setAndSave('headline', 'Hello world');
```

**Every bit of content in your site is never more than 1-line of code away.** It doesn’t matter how large or small your site is, with ProcessWire all your content is connected, making it fast and easy to find, and incredibly simple to access, output and manipulate.

**All fields in ProcessWire are custom fields that you easily define and edit in the admin.** You can create as many of them as you want, and of any type. You can even bundle them in repeatable groups called Repeater fields. ProcessWire is built to adapt to *your* content needs.

**Every field has a type and there are dozens of different types.** It’s all here—text, rich text, numbers, files, images, multi-language, dates, page references, custom repeatable groups, and on and on… plus you can easily add more, since they are plugins/modules!

> “*I just love the easy and intuitive ProcessWire API.* ProcessWire rocks!” —Jens Martsch, Web developer

## Clients love ProcessWire

* [### Secure

  Security has always been the #1 priority with ProcessWire, and it shows. It’s rock solid and we think you’ll find it the most secure open source CMS on the planet.](about/what/#an-emphasis-on-security)* [### No maintenance

    Unlike other platforms, you can launch a ProcessWire site and then leave it for years without maintenance or updates (should that be the need). It’s that reliable.](about/what/#no-maintenance-easy-to-support-for-the-long-term)* [### Multi-language

      ProcessWire is designed for multi-language from the core and provides best-in-class multi-language capabilities, multi-language fields and translation tools.](about/what/#multi-language-at-its-core)* [### So easy-to-use

        Clients don’t need to be trained how to use ProcessWire, because its simple and intuitive interface makes everything obvious and self explanatory for most users.](about/what/#a-breath-of-fresh-air-for-clients)* [### It’s free

          ProcessWire is pure open source (Mozilla Public License 2.0) and available on GitHub. The software is free, so clients’ budgets can focus on design and development.](about/license/)* [### Proven

            ProcessWire has been in active development for more than a decade and is here for the long term. It’s perhaps the most proven and reliable CMS in the industry.](about/what/#reliable)* [### Wysiwyg

              From its rich text editor and image editing tools to its front-end editing capabilities and more, ProcessWire provides the best content editing tools available.](about/what/#comprehensive)* [### Saves time
