- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `formSetDebugCfg` function in the Tenda W20E router firmware copies user-controlled input from the "enable", "level", and "module" parameters directly into a fixed-size stack buffer `cmd` using `sprintf` without performing any size checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow. The lack of size validation in `sprintf` allows an attacker to write past the bounds of the `cmd` buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Denial of Service (DoS): Overwriting the stack can lead to program crashes and service disruptions.
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE): With carefully crafted overflow data, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and execute arbitrary code on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP POST request to `/goform/setDebugCfg/` with oversized "enable", "level", and "module" parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.
  - The attacker needs to know the path `/goform/setDebugCfg/`
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
  - The attacker must be able to authenticate to the web interface, using credentials like "admin/admin" in this case.
