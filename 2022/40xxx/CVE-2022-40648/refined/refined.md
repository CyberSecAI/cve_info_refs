{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of X_B files, which can result in a write before the start of an allocated data structure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves user interaction, where the target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file (specifically an X_B file).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious X_B file or trick a user into visiting a malicious webpage."
