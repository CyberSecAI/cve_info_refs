## [Marching on…](marching-on/index.html)

August 7, 2024

It’s curious how NeDi has been deleted from Wikipedia since it’s written like an advertisement, they said. Knowing where the world is headed I couldn’t be bothered. The good thing, it’s still archived here so you can see for yourself, how the article advertised NeDi as being the best piece of software ever written ð…

Our roads literally getting busier by the day inspired me for this picture! I’m pretty sure we’ll be presented with a reasonable explanation as with all other questionable developments these days. I could never just go with the flow (there wouldn’t be a NeDi, if I did). Questioning the status quo of network management tools…

Yes as in Genesis 3:22 (2023 backwards). We’ll see what this year holds for mankind! However I’m still working on making the (networking) world a better place. NeDi 2.3 is out and the 2.2 community edition is available as well. Both are PHP8.x compatible to keep it safe and up-to-date. Please contact us, if you…

…seems to change on a monthly basis. I feel it will get even weirder than the past 2 years have been! NeDi’s development focusses more on core functions and stability these days, which allows me to work on this website some more. You’ll see changes soon as the relentless probes for vulnerabilities are annoying! But…

As Cyber attacks seem to move more into the focus of the WEF, I wanted to let you know that you can lock down NeDi some more by simply deleting devwrite.pl from nediâs inc/ folder. It might be a good idea to do that anyway, if you donât intend to use Devces-Write from the GUI….

Security researcher Veno Eivazian found some vulnerabilities in Nodes-Traffic and Monitoring-History (only exploitable by authenticated users). I thank him for contacting me thus helping to improve NeDi! He mentioned System-Files as well, but as this module can perform actual software updates and is only accessible by admins, any “mitigation” would defeat its purpose. Please update…

2020 has been difficult for many and revealing to me in addition. Thus I’ve decided to give up the Facebook page and plan to redo the video tutorials in order to focus on NeDi’s development with less distractions. Also I’m happy to release NeDi 2.0’s Patch3 to my customers today. In that sense, I wish…

NeDi is doing well, despite the unusual times we’re living in right now. I’m working on version 2.1 which will enhance network monitoring and management a lot. I’ll start working on new tutorials as well. If you’re curious about the current version, you can head over to the updated NeDi Demo.

|  | > Vulnerability : Observable Discrepancy |
|  |  |
|  | > Vulnerability Description : In certain Nedi products, a vulnerability in the web UI of NeDi login & |
|  | Community login could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to |
|  | affect the integrity of a device via a User Enumeration vulnerability. |
|  | The vulnerability is due to insecure design, where a difference in |
|  | forgot password utility could allow an attacker to determine if the |
|  | user is valid or not, enabling a brute force attack with valid users. |
|  | This affects NeDi 1.0.7 for OS X 1.0.7 <= and NeDi for Suse 1.0.7 <= |
|  | and NeDi for FreeBSD 1.0.7 <= & community login page. |
|  |  |
|  |  |

Note:- If user doesn't exist then it show message of " There are no usernames associated with that email. " |
|  |  |
|  | > Remediation : The Password reset utility should have generic/common message as output to mitigate the risk of User Enumeration. |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | > Affected Component : Community Login of NeDi, personal hosted login of NeDi |
|  |  |
|  | > [Impact Information Disclosure] |
