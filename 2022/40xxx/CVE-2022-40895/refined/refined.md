Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the GitHub Gist:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure design in the "forgot password" functionality of NeDi's web UI. Specifically, the system provides different responses based on whether an email address is associated with a valid user or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Observable Discrepancy/User Enumeration:** The "forgot password" utility reveals whether a given email address is associated with a user account. If a user does not exist, the message "There are no usernames associated with that email" is displayed. This allows an attacker to differentiate between valid and invalid usernames/email addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can enumerate valid usernames by using the "forgot password" functionality. This information can be used to plan further attacks like brute-force password attempts.
*   **Increased Risk of Brute-Force Attacks:** Knowing valid usernames makes brute-force password attacks more feasible and targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without needing prior authentication.
*   **"Forgot Password" Functionality:** The attack vector involves using the "forgot password" feature of NeDi's login page or community login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access to the NeDi Web UI:** The attacker needs network connectivity to access the NeDi web interface.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Web Interactions:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login page and the forgot password functionality and interpret the responses.
*   **No prior authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials

**Affected Components:**
*   NeDi Login page
*   NeDi Community login page

**Affected Versions:**
* NeDi 1.0.7 for OS X 1.0.7 <=
* NeDi for Suse 1.0.7 <=
* NeDi for FreeBSD 1.0.7 <=

**Remediation:**
The suggested remediation is to implement a generic/common response message for password reset attempts, regardless of whether the user exists or not. This would prevent an attacker from distinguishing valid users.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is specifically a "User Enumeration" vulnerability.
* The provided links reference the NeDi website and forum.
