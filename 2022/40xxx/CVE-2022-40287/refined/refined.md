- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The application is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in user profile data fields, specifically within messaging functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage the XSS vulnerability to escalate privileges or compromise the targeted account.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is through user profile data fields within the messaging functionality, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
