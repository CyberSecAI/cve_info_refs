The provided content contains vulnerability reports for multiple WordPress plugins, all related to CVE-2022-40700.  Each report describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a specific plugin.

Here's a breakdown of the common vulnerability details extracted from all the reports:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The plugins are vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This generally occurs due to the lack of proper validation or sanitization of user-supplied URLs, allowing an attacker to make the server perform requests to attacker-controlled external domains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability across all listed plugins. This is a weakness that allows an attacker to make the server perform HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Domain Requests:**  A malicious actor could cause the website to make requests to any domain controlled by the attacker.
- **Information Disclosure:** Potentially allows the attacker to access sensitive information from other services running on the same system as the vulnerable website (e.g., internal services, metadata endpoints).
- **General Description**: The impact varies from case to case and is not ideal for CMS's.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through manipulating input fields or parameters that process URLs within the vulnerable plugin. This allows the attacker to inject a malicious URL that the server will attempt to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated users in all cases.
