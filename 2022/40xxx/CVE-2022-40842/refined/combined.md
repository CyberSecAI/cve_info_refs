[Leave a comment](https://www.ndk-design.fr/documentation-ndkadvancedcustomizationfields-prestashop-english#respond)

### Installation :

Load the zip file directly from the backoffice of PrestaShop, « modules> add a module » tab.

### Configuration :

After installing the module form invites you to learn typography and a color palette. This data will be used by the visual text editor.

[![ndkacf-config](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d’écran-2015-11-05-à-09.15.53-300x158.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2015-11-05-%C3%A0-09.15.53.png)

#### 1 . Font colors :

To add colors, simply list your colors in the fields separated by a;

You can insert named web colors, hexadecimal or rgb formats (AliceBlue; # F007C; rgb (233, 210, 123);)

#### 2. Fonts

In order to simplify the insertion of typography and its compatibility with browsers, you can integrate a selection of Google Font typography into the module.

To do so, visit https://www.google.com/fonts/

Select the typefaces of your choice by clicking on the blue « add to collection » button.

Once you have made your selection, click on the « use » button at the bottom right of your screen.

In section 3, you will find a section called « 3. Add this code to your website « .

then copy the part between quotation marks after the href as in this example: (in green the part to copy)

<link href = ‘https: //fonts.googleapis.com/css slabo + family = 27px’ rel = « stylesheet » type = ‘text / css’>

Do not forget to save your configuration!

####

#### 3. pre-defined configurations

You can offer pre-defined configurations to guide your customers. To do this, activate the option, then while being connected to your shop administration, go on your product in front office. Create your configuration and save it using the form provided.

#### 4. Client configurations

You can also allow your connected clients to save their settings for later retrieval.

a registration form will then be proposed to your customers.

Returns on your products, the module will propose them to load their old configurations.

Don’t forget to save your configuration!

### Fields :

In this section we will detail the different types of fields and their functionalities.

#### Generality :

All field types have different configurations.

In general, fields can have a visual effect on the image of the product. For example, for a text field, you can choose to display the text entered by the user directly on the product to get a preview. The same applies to an image or color field that may or may not have an immediate visual effect.

To do this, simply check yes for the « Visual effect » zone

In the same way, fields with visual effect can be modified or not (resized, rotation, color…).

To do this, simply check yes for the « Configurator » box.

You have the possibility to add a surcharge for each field, this one must be reseigné duty free.

If you prefer to manage the surcharge by value, leave this field at 0.

Each field can be assigned to one or more products.

Use the product search field to select the products that will be affected by this field.

Alternatively, you can assign this field to one or more product categories.

Use either one or the other to better control your organization.

Each field is composed of values (except the text field).

After creating your field, click on the display button to see a list of its values.

You can add as much value as you want.

You will be able to define in each list of values which will be the default value if you want it to be applied to the page loading.

You will also have the possibility to interact the fields with the « influence » functionality.

the influence works as follows:

take the example of 2 fields named A and B.

Field A can be told to influence field B, so that for each value in field A it will be possible to choose which value (s) in field B will be disabled.

Ex:

A1 disables B1 and B3

A2 disables B2, B3 and B4…

Note that one field can influence several fields.

Fields A and B and their values must be created beforehand

#### Text field  or textarea :

The text field will allow you to add a free text field to customize your products.

Text fields and text boxes have the same options

You can either add a simple field or a visual field.

You can specify the maximum number of characters and the number of text lines allowed.

If the visual effect is activated, the user can choose the typography and color of the text.

You have the option of specifying:

The colors available as hexadecimal colors, separated by a; (#ffffff; #cccccccccccccc; #00000000; #EEEEEEEEEE…).

sizes in px separated by one; (20;30;40;50…).

typographies by filling in a google link are different from the general configuration.

The effects by selecting the desired available effects.

You can also modify the placeholder of the field (name registered by default in the field). To do this, add values to the field (if your multi-line field, add as many values as lines.

In the value, the value will then be the field label.

In this same form, you will be able to add a mask to the text field to force its formatting. In the mask text field enter the desired mask.

example: 00/00/0000 (for a date), 00:00:00 (for an hour), 00:00,00 kg for a weight, AAAA (for a field that accepts only 4 alphabetical characters), 0# (only digits will be accepted), A# (only letters will be accepted).

#### Select field :option 1option 2option 3

The select field is a single body which will then allow you to offer various options to your customer with a cost or not.

#### Image field :

The image field allows you to propose options in an illustrated way.

It also allows you to apply a visual or visual effect on the product and also to apply the configurator (image position, rotation…).

If you send a visual in svg format, it can be colored. (practical to colorize a precise shape without having to generate all the images)

You can then define the available colors as for the text field, or keep the general configuration.

As in Photoshop® for example, you will be able to choose the transparency mode of this color (whether it is an image or a square of color generated by the module): normal, superimposed, brighten, darken, color, hue, saturation.

You can also add tags to your images to allow users to filter it according to these tags.

[![Capture d’écran 2015-11-06 à 10.03.11](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d’écran-2015-11-06-à-10.03.11-300x268.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2015-11-06-%C3%A0-10.03.11.png)

#### Color field :

This field works exactly like the image field.

The difference is that on the front-office side, instead of displaying a list of images, colour squares will be proposed.

As in Photoshop® for example, you will be able to choose the transparency mode of this color (whether it is an image or a square of color generated by the module): normal, superimposed, brighten, darken, color, hue, saturation.

These transparency effects can be useful if you don’t want to produce images of each of your colors.

You define the color from the value creation form.

#### Full Designer field :

This field combines the features of text, text, image and upload fields.

It will allow your customers to add as many text fields, text boxes and images as they want.

As in Photoshop® for example, you will be able to choose the transparency mode of this color (whether it is an image or a square of color generated by the module): normal, superimposed, brighten, darken, color, hue, saturation.

#### Accessory field :

The accessory field allows you to propose accessories for your products. For each accessory you can specify the name, picture, description, price, minimum quantity, maximum quantity.

Each option will then propose to your customers a quantity field allowing them to add several quantities of each accessory.

#### Product accessory field :

This field works in the same way as your accessory field except that for each value, you select a product from your catalog. The module will generate a product pack on demand, ensuring the synchronization of your stocks.

For each value, you will be able to overload the price (if it is not indicated, the price of the product will be applied).

The module will also allow your customers to select the desired product range and quantity, thus calculating the price according to these parameters.

Warning: if the price is overloaded, it will overcharge the price of any product version.

#### Combination tab field :

its principle is the same as the Product Accessory field, since it allows you to propose the products in your catalog as an accessory, except that this one sets your declinations flat, in order to allow your customers to order x quantity of each declination.

If you enter a minimum number of quantities, it is the quantity of the product for all variations combined that will be counted.

The field takes into account the discounts per quantity fixed for the product in question and its variations

note: combinations must have 2 attributes for this field to work.

####

#### Custom font field :

This field will allow you to create your own typography, very useful if you sell engraved or sculpted letters (jewellery).

You will then have to create your alphabet in image and upload each image as a value by naming it with the associated letter.

Example value A => image of the letter A

Note: you can specify characters in capital letters or not

Example value A => image of the letter A

Example value a => image of the letter a

If you don’t want to differentiate between capitals, proceed as follows:

Example value A|a => image of the letter A

the separator | allows you to associate several characters to the same image.

A|a|à => image of the letter A

#### The Price table field:

this field allows you to load a csv file to calculate your rates according to 2 variables.

for example for dimensions (length/width)

once your file is loaded, add 2 values to the field, the first for the column and the second for the row

#### View field :

This field will allow you to create multiple customization views for your products.

For example, for a T-shirt, you will create the field « Side of the T-shirt » with the values « Face » and « Back ».

For each of these values, you will enter the corresponding image.

This is the first field to be created if you want to give your customers the ability to visually customize their products.

Indeed once this field is created, you will have the possibility to point your fields on a specific view.

For example, the visual will only be applicable on the face of the T-shirt, and the text only on the back.

By pointing to a view, you can also draw a rectangle on this view, delimiting the customization area.

[![Capture d’écran 2015-11-06 à 10.10.48](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/zoning-shirt-300x234.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/zoning-shirt.png)

Note: For advanced users, you also have the ability to load an svg as a view. This can be useful to point a text field at a curve that has been drawn (in Illustrator® or inkscape® for example). The module will then propose you to point your text field on this view to select the curve. You will be able to manage several curves on the same view.

[![capture-decran-2016-12-29-a-11-37-43](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d’écran-2016-12-29-à-11.37.43-300x287.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2016-12-29-%C3%A0-11.37.43.png)

#### What about packs?

The packs are not to be outdone because they are customizable!

You can assign one or more fields to a pack in the same way as for a standard product.

Even stronger: if you create a pack containing already customizable products, the fields of all these products will be retrieved allowing your customers to customize these products within the framework of a pack!

[![capture-decran-2016-12-29-a-11-45-39](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d’écran-2016-12-29-à-11.45.39-300x248.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2016-12-29-%C3%A0-11.45.39.png)

#### The configurations:

The personalization module for Prestashop can save configurations made by your customers if you wish.

This can allow you several things:

* Find the customizations made by your customers to improve your service.
* Allow your customers to load old configurations in 1 click to improve their experience on your site.
* Allow your customers to save and name their configurations for easy retrieval.As administrator of the site, you will also be able to go to a front office product sheet and save one or more configuration on your different products.

  So, you’ll be able to name these customizations that will be marked as admin customizations.

  Admin customizations will then be offered to your customers, allowing you to guide them through the purchase process by loading your pre-defined configurations in 1 click.

  Note: in admin you can associate an image with your pre-defined configurations.

  You can also select if you want a default configuration that will be loaded automatically on arrival on the page. The price of this configuration will overload the price of the product in your product listing!

  If you use this feature (default configuration) and your site is multilingual, you will need to create a language configuration (changing language to front office) so that each label is in the client language. In fact, the module associates a language with each configuration and offers your customers only the configurations that are in their language.

#### Field groups:

The module offers additional functionality to improve your administration work if you have a large amount of referrals.

With groups of fields, you will be able to gather several fields (previously created) and control them more quickly:

For example, you select 10 fields that can be applied to multiple products and associate them with your product lists and / or categories from a single page. By saving, all selected fields in the group are automatically assigned to the desired products.

**You can’t see module visible in front office**

Please check that the module is good on the hook:

according to your version of Prestashop

Prestashop 1.7 => displayReassurance

Prestashop 1.6 => displayReassurance

If it does not appear, check also the presence of the hook in the code of your theme

note: this hook should not be inside a <form> </ form> tag, if in doubt consult the developer of your theme

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality.

### Installation :

Load the zip file directly from the backoffice of PrestaShop, « modules> add a module » tab.

### Configuration :

After installing the module form invites you to learn typography and a color palette. This data will be used by the visual text editor.

[![ndkacf-config](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d’écran-2015-11-05-à-09.15.53-300x158.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2015-11-05-%C3%A0-09.15.53.png)

#### 1 . Font colors :

To add colors, simply list your colors in the fields separated by a;

You can insert named web colors, hexadecimal or rgb formats (AliceBlue; # F007C; rgb (233, 210, 123);)

#### 2. Fonts

In order to simplify the insertion of typography and its compatibility with browsers, you can integrate a selection of Google Font typography into the module.

To do so, visit https://www.google.com/fonts/

Select the typefaces of your choice by clicking on the blue « add to collection » button.

Once you have made your selection, click on the « use » button at the bottom right of your screen.

In section 3, you will find a section called « 3. Add this code to your website « .

then copy the part between quotation marks after the href as in this example: (in green the part to copy)

<link href = ‘https: //fonts.googleapis.com/css slabo + family = 27px’ rel = « stylesheet » type = ‘text / css’>

Do not forget to save your configuration!

####

#### 3. pre-defined configurations

You can offer pre-defined configurations to guide your customers. To do this, activate the option, then while being connected to your shop administration, go on your product in front office. Create your configuration and save it using the form provided.

#### 4. Client configurations

You can also allow your connected clients to save their settings for later retrieval.

a registration form will then be proposed to your customers.

Returns on your products, the module will propose them to load their old configurations.

Don’t forget to save your configuration!

### Fields :

In this section we will detail the different types of fields and their functionalities.

#### Generality :

All field types have different configurations.

In general, fields can have a visual effect on the image of the product. For example, for a text field, you can choose to display the text entered by the user directly on the product to get a preview. The same applies to an image or color field that may or may not have an immediate visual effect.

To do this, simply check yes for the « Visual effect » zone

In the same way, fields with visual effect can be modified or not (resized, rotation, color…).

To do this, simply check yes for the « Configurator » box.

You have the possibility to add a surcharge for each field, this one must be reseigné duty free.

If you prefer to manage the surcharge by value, leave this field at 0.

Each field can be assigned to one or more products.

Use the product search field to select the products that will be affected by this field.

Alternatively, you can assign this field to one or more product categories.

Use either one or the other to better control your organization.

Each field is composed of values (except the text field).

After creating your field, click on the display button to see a list of its values.

You can add as much value as you want.

You will be able to define in each list of values which will be the default value if you want it to be applied to the page loading.

You will also have the possibility to interact the fields with the « influence » functionality.

the influence works as follows:

take the example of 2 fields named A and B.

Field A can be told to influence field B, so that for each value in field A it will be possible to choose which value (s) in field B will be disabled.

Ex:

A1 disables B1 and B3

A2 disables B2, B3 and B4…

Note that one field can influence several fields.

Fields A and B and their values must be created beforehand

#### Text field  or textarea :

The text field will allow you to add a free text field to customize your products.

Text fields and text boxes have the same options

You can either add a simple field or a visual field.

You can specify the maximum number of characters and the number of text lines allowed.

If the visual effect is activated, the user can choose the typography and color of the text.

You have the option of specifying:

The colors available as hexadecimal colors, separated by a; (#ffffff; #cccccccccccccc; #00000000; #EEEEEEEEEE…).

sizes in px separated by one; (20;30;40;50…).

typographies by filling in a google link are different from the general configuration.

The effects by selecting the desired available effects.

You can also modify the placeholder of the field (name registered by default in the field). To do this, add values to the field (if your multi-line field, add as many values as lines.

In the value, the value will then be the field label.

In this same form, you will be able to add a mask to the text field to force its formatting. In the mask text field enter the desired mask.

example: 00/00/0000 (for a date), 00:00:00 (for an hour), 00:00,00 kg for a weight, AAAA (for a field that accepts only 4 alphabetical characters), 0# (only digits will be accepted), A# (only letters will be accepted).

#### Select field :option 1option 2option 3

The select field is a single body which will then allow you to offer various options to your customer with a cost or not.

#### Image field :

The image field allows you to propose options in an illustrated way.

It also allows you to apply a visual or visual effect on the product and also to apply the configurator (image position, rotation…).

If you send a visual in svg format, it can be colored. (practical to colorize a precise shape without having to generate all the images)

You can then define the available colors as for the text field, or keep the general configuration.

As in Photoshop® for example, you will be able to choose the transparency mode of this color (whether it is an image or a square of color generated by the module): normal, superimposed, brighten, darken, color, hue, saturation.

You can also add tags to your images to allow users to filter it according to these tags.

[![Capture d’écran 2015-11-06 à 10.03.11](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d’écran-2015-11-06-à-10.03.11-300x268.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2015-11-06-%C3%A0-10.03.11.png)

#### Color field :

This field works exactly like the image field.

The difference is that on the front-office side, instead of displaying a list of images, colour squares will be proposed.

As in Photoshop® for example, you will be able to choose the transparency mode of this color (whether it is an image or a square of color generated by the module): normal, superimposed, brighten, darken, color, hue, saturation.

These transparency effects can be useful if you don’t want to produce images of each of your colors.

You define the color from the value creation form.

#### Full Designer field :

This field combines the features of text, text, image and upload fields.

It will allow your customers to add as many text fields, text boxes and images as they want.

As in Photoshop® for example, you will be able to choose the transparency mode of this color (whether it is an image or a square of color generated by the module): normal, superimposed, brighten, darken, color, hue, saturation.

#### Accessory field :

The accessory field allows you to propose accessories for your products. For each accessory you can specify the name, picture, description, price, minimum quantity, maximum quantity.

Each option will then propose to your customers a quantity field allowing them to add several quantities of each accessory.

#### Product accessory field :

This field works in the same way as your accessory field except that for each value, you select a product from your catalog. The module will generate a product pack on demand, ensuring the synchronization of your stocks.

For each value, you will be able to overload the price (if it is not indicated, the price of the product will be applied).

The module will also allow your customers to select the desired product range and quantity, thus calculating the price according to these parameters.

Warning: if the price is overloaded, it will overcharge the price of any product version.

#### Combination tab field :

its principle is the same as the Product Accessory field, since it allows you to propose the products in your catalog as an accessory, except that this one sets your declinations flat, in order to allow your customers to order x quantity of each declination.

If you enter a minimum number of quantities, it is the quantity of the product for all variations combined that will be counted.

The field takes into account the discounts per quantity fixed for the product in question and its variations

note: combinations must have 2 attributes for this field to work.

####

#### Custom font field :

This field will allow you to create your own typography, very useful if you sell engraved or sculpted letters (jewellery).

You will then have to create your alphabet in image and upload each image as a value by naming it with the associated letter.

Example value A => image of the letter A

Note: you can specify characters in capital letters or not

Example value A => image of the letter A

Example value a => image of the letter a

If you don’t want to differentiate between capitals, proceed as follows:

Example value A|a => image of the letter A

the separator | allows you to associate several characters to the same image.

A|a|à => image of the letter A

#### The Price table field:

this field allows you to load a csv file to calculate your rates according to 2 variables.

for example for dimensions (length/width)

once your file is loaded, add 2 values to the field, the first for the column and the second for the row

#### View field :

This field will allow you to create multiple customization views for your products.

For example, for a T-shirt, you will create the field « Side of the T-shirt » with the values « Face » and « Back ».

For each of these values, you will enter the corresponding image.

This is the first field to be created if you want to give your customers the ability to visually customize their products.

Indeed once this field is created, you will have the possibility to point your fields on a specific view.

For example, the visual will only be applicable on the face of the T-shirt, and the text only on the back.

By pointing to a view, you can also draw a rectangle on this view, delimiting the customization area.

[![Capture d’écran 2015-11-06 à 10.10.48](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/zoning-shirt-300x234.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/zoning-shirt.png)

Note: For advanced users, you also have the ability to load an svg as a view. This can be useful to point a text field at a curve that has been drawn (in Illustrator® or inkscape® for example). The module will then propose you to point your text field on this view to select the curve. You will be able to manage several curves on the same view.

[![capture-decran-2016-12-29-a-11-37-43](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d’écran-2016-12-29-à-11.37.43-300x287.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2016-12-29-%C3%A0-11.37.43.png)

#### What about packs?

The packs are not to be outdone because they are customizable!

You can assign one or more fields to a pack in the same way as for a standard product.

Even stronger: if you create a pack containing already customizable products, the fields of all these products will be retrieved allowing your customers to customize these products within the framework of a pack!

[![capture-decran-2016-12-29-a-11-45-39](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d’écran-2016-12-29-à-11.45.39-300x248.png)](http://www.ndk-design.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2016-12-29-%C3%A0-11.45.39.png)

#### The configurations:

The personalization module for Prestashop can save configurations made by your customers if you wish.

This can allow you several things:

* Find the customizations made by your customers to improve your service.
* Allow your customers to load old configurations in 1 click to improve their experience on your site.
* Allow your customers to save and name their configurations for easy retrieval.As administrator of the site, you will also be able to go to a front office product sheet and save one or more configuration on your different products.

  So, you’ll be able to name these customizations that will be marked as admin customizations.

  Admin customizations will then be offered to your customers, allowing you to guide them through the purchase process by loading your pre-defined configurations in 1 click.

  Note: in admin you can associate an image with your pre-defined configurations.

  You can also select if you want a default configuration that will be loaded automatically on arrival on the page. The price of this configuration will overload the price of the product in your product listing!

  If you use this feature (default configuration) and your site is multilingual, you will need to create a language configuration (changing language to front office) so that each label is in the client language. In fact, the module associates a language with each configuration and offers your customers only the configurations that are in their language.

#### Field groups:

The module offers additional functionality to improve your administration work if you have a large amount of referrals.

With groups of fields, you will be able to gather several fields (previously created) and control them more quickly:

For example, you select 10 fields that can be applied to multiple products and associate them with your product lists and / or categories from a single page. By saving, all selected fields in the group are automatically assigned to the desired products.

**You can’t see module visible in front office**

Please check that the module is good on the hook:

according to your version of Prestashop

Prestashop 1.7 => displayReassurance

Prestashop 1.6 => displayReassurance

If it does not appear, check also the presence of the hook in the code of your theme

note: this hook should not be inside a <form> </ form> tag, if in doubt consult the developer of your theme
