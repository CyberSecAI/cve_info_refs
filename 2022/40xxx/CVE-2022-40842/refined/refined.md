Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-40842

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `loc` parameter within the `rotateimg.php` file of the NdkAdvancedCustomizationFields Prestashop module. This allows an attacker to control the URL used in a server-side request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is an SSRF. The application takes a user-supplied URL (through the `loc` parameter) and makes a request to that URL on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this SSRF vulnerability to scan internal networks, accessing resources that are not directly accessible from the outside internet.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** An attacker could potentially use the SSRF to interact with other internal services and potentially gain more access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `rotateimg.php` file.
- The `loc` parameter in the URL is used to inject a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No authentication is mentioned, so the attacker does not necessarily need to be a user of the application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable URL is:
`http://localhost/modules/ndk_advanced_custom_fields/rotateimg.php?loc={{inject here}&rot=90&top=1000&left=1000&width=1000&height=1000&imgwidth=1000`

-   The `loc` parameter is where an attacker injects the malicious URL.
-   Other parameters such as `rot`, `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, and `imgwidth` are also present but are not directly related to the SSRF vulnerability.

The exploit code shows a basic SSRF attack by manipulating the `loc` parameter, leading the server to request a URL controlled by the attacker.
