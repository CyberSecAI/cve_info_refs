# Laravel timing attack vulnerability

Timing attacks can be used to obtain sensitive information about users on a Laravel application. This article explains how. (CVE-2022-40482)

Af Jens Just Iversen

Timing attacks are a side-channel attack that is used to obtain sensitive information by looking at how long requests took.

If a request was slow it meant that the script had more to process.

If a request was fast it meant that the script had less to process.

By this information an attacker is able to guess what goes on behind the surface - for instance if a user is registered on a site or not.

This is called a user enumeration vulnerability, and it is present in [Laravel](/laravel) up until September 2022.
CVE number: [CVE-2022-40482](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40482)

### The problem with user enumeration

User enumeration is already taken serious in authentication in Laravel.
That is why the error message when login failed is a generic "These credentials do not match our records."-message.

If the message had been "The email does not exist" or "The password is incorrect" it would have been a big help for users struggling to log in, but it would also be very easy for an attacker to harvest existing emails/usernames.

The problem with user enumeration is that when an attacker have a list of verified emails, they have to only try to crack the passwords for those existing emails - not all emails in the world.
This makes the attack very practical.

Maybe the attacker even gets lucky and finds several leaked passwords from haveibeenpwn database matching the harvested emails?

Even though user enumeration is very sensitive for some sites, most sites are not directly vulnerable because of it.
It is when user enumeration is used in tandem with other attacks it becomes a problem.

So is it a problem then?

‐ yes, because most attacks *are* done by combining different exploits.

### Timeless timing attacks

When we started digging into timing attacks here at Ephort we quickly realized that traditional timing attacks were not that practical.
Whitepapers, presentations at hacker conferences and blog posts revealed that to get something out of a traditional timing attack you had to have very large sample sizes and do a lot of advanced statistical analysis on the data.

This means that most traditional timing attacks have happened against hardware or software solutions where large sample sizes are not a problem to obtain.

Most web applications however do have some kind of throttling, max attempts, DDoS detection or the like that would make timing attacks impractical.

Discovering [timeless timing attacks](https://tom.vg/papers/timeless-timing-attack_usenix2020.pdf) was another story though.
Where timing attacks uses wall clock time to measure how long a request took, timeless timing attacks make use of HTTP/2 multiplexing protocol to send pairs of requests, and then only look at in which order the requests arrived back to the client.

This is possible because multiplexing allows the client to group multiple requests in one network package, let the server process them as fast as it can, and then let the server send them back to the client in the order it was done executing it.
This means that all network jitter that make a traditional timing attack impractical are not part of the equation in timeless timing attacks.

That way timeless timing attacks can reliably measure timing differences in 2 different requests on 20 microseconds with a sample size of only 6.
Throttling, max attempts and DDoS protection is therefor also a much smaller problem.

### The Laravel timing attack

As we primarily work with [Laravel](/laravel) we decided to look into the Laravel framework to see if it was vulnerable to timeless timing attacks.
Usually authentication or forgot password-functionality are places where user enumeration through timing attacks are possible.

This was also the case with Laravel.

Looking through the source code scanning for early-returns we found this one in the `Illuminate\Auth\SessionGuard` class:

```
protected function hasValidCredentials($user, $credentials)
{
    $validated = ! is_null($user) && $this->provider->validateCredentials($user, $credentials);

    if ($validated) {
        $this->fireValidatedEvent($user);
    }

    return $validated;
}

```

The first line of the method checks if the user exists, but if the user does not exist, nothing more of that line as well as the `$this->fireValidatedEvent($user);` line are executed.

This means that there is less code to execute for the server if the user does not exist making the request take a tiny bit less time to execute compared to if the user *did* exist.

Tom Goethem and the three other authors of timeless timing attacks have published a [proof of concept tool](https://github.com/DistriNet/timeless-timing-attacks) that can be used to test if a site is vulnerable to timeless timing attacks.

By using this tool against a fresh [Laravel](/laravel) installation we were able to confirm that Laravel was vulnerable to timeless timing attacks.
We did the following:

* Created a lot of users on the database
* One of these users are "known" to the hacker in our test (the hacker goes on to the site and creates a user). This is used for comparison on timing differences when sending request pairs - one of those requests in a request-pair is then always the known user.
* For each 4 logins made by the proof of concept script we do an actual login on the site with the known user. This is done to reset the login rate limiting.
* Disable CSRF protection (not all sites make use of this. If they do the script has to be amended so that it fetches a token before logging in)

The script then sent 5 request pairs.

Each pair contained:

* one request to the login endpoint where the email was known, but the password was wrong.
* one request to the login endpoint where the email was randomized, and the password was wrong.

The script very reliably determined that the second request in the pair was the one that took longer to execute, meaning the user exists.

Running the same script where both requests in the request pair contained emails that were registered on the test page, the script was not able to determine which request took longer to execute, meaning both emails exist (because the attacker knows that one of them exists).

Hackers are therefor able to harvest emails from a site by sending request pairs to the login endpoint containing one email that they have registered on the page and then the second request would contain emails that the hacker want to test if they exist.

The script we have used to test this vulnerability can be found [on our GitHub](https://github.com/ephort/laravel-user-enumeration-demo).

### The fix

To prevent timing attacks the time the execution of the code takes should not be dependent on the input.

That way an attacker is not able to connect input data with what actually goes on behind the surface.

We were therefor able to patch the exploit by wrapping the content of hasValidCredentials method in a "timebox".
That is a method that takes a closure and a time limit, and then executes and waits until the time limit is reached.

The timebox therefor always returns in the same amount of time no matter how fast the content of the closure was executed.

The pull request to the Laravel repository can be seen here <https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/44069>.

This fix does not slow down login attempts for users who type correct credentials. It only affects users who type a wrong email or password.

## Timebox class

This new Timebox class makes a callable execute for at least the supplied amount of time.

This helps us guard against timing attacks at the application.

## Timeless timing attacks

The authentication method is currently vulnerable to user enumeration via timeless timing attacks.

This is caused by the early return inside the `hasValidCredentials` method in the `Illuminate\Auth\SessionGuard` class.

If the user does not exist most of the code in that method will not be called and thus the execution time will be a tiny bit shorter.

With traditional timing attacks this would not be practical to utilize because of the large sample sizes needed, but [timeless timing attacks](https://tom.vg/papers/timeless-timing-attack_usenix2020.pdf) which uses the HTTP/2 multiplexing protocol can with high accuracy measure timing differences between two calls to a remote server on 20 microseconds with a sample size of only 6 request pairs.

This means that most throttling/max attempts/DoS attack protection etc will not be triggered, and it is suddently very practical to harvest existing emails for a site (user enumeration).

User enumeration in itself is a security problem for some sites (where users dont want others to know they are using that site), but in general user enumeration can be used in tandem with other attacks (e.g. brute-forcing passwords or using previously leaked passwords).

## The patch

That is why the new Timebox class is also implemented inside the `hasValidCredentials` method in this PR.

A demo script that can be used to exploit the user enumeration can be [found here](https://github.com/ephort/laravel-user-enumeration-demo).

The changes in this PR add a minimum execution time for the `hasValidCredentials` method of 200 milliseconds.

But if the credentials are correct the timebox will be escaped and the user would not have to wait.

So this change only affects users typing the wrong credentials.

This pull request is opened with permission from Taylor via e-mail.

More in depth explanation of timeless timing attacks [can be found here](https://ephort.dk/blog/laravel-timing-attack-vulnerability/).

Sorry, something went wrong.

# User enumeration through timeless timing attack in Laravel

This repository works as a demo to exploit the user enumeration vulnerability in Laravel.

The script is build on [Timeless Timing Attack](https://tom.vg/papers/timeless-timing-attack_usenix2020.pdf) by Tom Van Goethem et al.
The repository containing the proof of concept script h2time (which is part of this demo) can be found on <https://github.com/DistriNet/timeless-timing-attacks>

## Pre-requisites

* The site must have CSRF protection disabled. If it is enabled you have to obtain a valid CSRF token before trying to login.
* You - as the attacker - must know one valid email and password combination on the target site.

## How to run

* In `h2time.py` there is a built in login+logout for each 4 request pairs to the server to prevent the application from doing rate limiting.
  This has to be amended to match a known user+password combination on the target site.
* In `laravel.py` post\_data must contain the email you want to test if exists on the target site.
* In `laravel.py` post\_data2 must contain an email you know exists on the target site. The password must be wrong, so that it does not login.
* Run the script with the following command:

```
python3 laravel.py
```

The script will tell you which request from the request-pair that most of the times took longest to return.
If it "could not determine winner" that means they generally took the same time to return meaning the email under test exists on the server.
