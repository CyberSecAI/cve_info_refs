How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

I have been using the Themeum WP Page Builder for a year or so now, across several pages. It is straight forward and easy to use.
Their tech support is brilliant. I have had to contact them a couple of times and they have always been quick to respond and take my queries seriously. They have been patient and are willing to engage in back and forth trouble-shooting when necessary.
I feel like they are always there if I run into trouble.

It is one of the most complete free page builders, contains everything that can be used to create a site, such as the most famous page builders.

I am using the WordPress for three years. But few days ago I just see this builder. I dnt try it too much. But I am happy to see the initiative from thmemium. They are doing a great job as support is active also.
Future of this plugin will be bright if they add header footer editors and some others things like single post pages or single product pages and achieves with regular support and updating.

I create a page on the WordPress website using your editor, when editing, I see a division by blocks in width (1/2, 1/4, etc.), and when I go to the created page, my display goes without blocks (1/1).
How to fix it ??

The plugn is doing what it is supposed to do â if there are issues, the Suport Team is responsive, even if itâS the free version. Good job in providing and supporting.
