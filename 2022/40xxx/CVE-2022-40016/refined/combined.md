| Firstly, make the librtmp RELEASE to avoid it exit early because of assert.  And then, run the rtmp server using test with command `test -c rtmp_server_forward_aio_test 127.0.0.1 1935`  After server run, push flow to server with something like `ffmpeg -re -i source.flv -c copy -f flv -y rtmp://localhost/live/livestream`  Finally, send poc message to server with command `python3 sender.py 127.0.0.1 1935 poc`. [The attachment](https://github.com/ireader/media-server/files/9260186/poc.zip) is script and poc file.  After send the poc message, the server execute an UAF and finally crash. |

| I know the program works well, I have tested it to play with vlc.  I mean, if the problem indeed exist, anyone using the library to develop rtmp server will get a DoS if client send malicious packets.  RELEASE version is only to avoid early exit because of assert. |
