Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability within the rtmp server implementation of the `ireader/media-server` project. This occurs when a client sends a specially crafted "poc" message to the server.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-After-Free (UAF): The server attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious client can send a crafted packet that will crash the server, rendering it unavailable to other clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific RTMP message over the network to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the RTMP server.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and send the malicious "poc" message.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered using a provided python script, `sender.py`, and a `poc` file.
- The vulnerability is triggered after a normal rtmp stream is established (via ffmpeg, etc).
- The project maintainer was able to reproduce the issue and has closed the issue after applying a fix.
