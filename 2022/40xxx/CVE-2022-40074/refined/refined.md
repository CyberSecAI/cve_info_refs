The provided content details a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC21 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `setSchedWifi` function within the `/bin/httpd` file.
- The `strcpy` function is used to copy data from the `schedStartTime` and `schedEndTime` parameters to a heap buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow. The use of `strcpy` without length validation allows data beyond the allocated buffer size to be written.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). By sending a crafted HTTP POST request with long `schedStartTime` and `schedEndTime` parameters, an attacker can trigger a heap overflow leading to a crash or system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint.
- Specifically, the `schedStartTime` and `schedEndTime` parameters are used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. Typically, this means the attacker is on the same network as the router or can reach the router's web interface via a port forward or other routing mechanism.
