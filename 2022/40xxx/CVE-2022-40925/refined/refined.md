The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Zoo Management System v1.0. This vulnerability is located in the `save_event` file of the "Events" module within the admin panel.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file upload vulnerability at the image upload point in the `save_event` file. The system does not properly validate the uploaded file, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Arbitrary File Upload: The system allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file type or content.
    *   Lack of Input Sanitization: The system fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the upload of executable code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). By uploading a PHP file containing malicious code, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality in the `save_event` handler within the admin panel of the Zoo Management System. The specific form fields used in the exploit include `event_name`, `event_description`, `event_duration`, `image` and `event_start_date`.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker must have access to the admin panel.
    * The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PHP file.
    * The attacker must send a crafted `POST` request to the `/ZooManagementSystem/admin/public_html/save_event` endpoint using the correct `multipart/form-data` structure.

The provided content includes a proof of concept request to upload a PHP file named `shell.php` which contains phpinfo(). The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
