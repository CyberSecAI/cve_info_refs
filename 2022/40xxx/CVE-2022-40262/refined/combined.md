    - #### AMI FirST Builds a Platform of Trust

      The supply chain is a significant cybersecurity threat for mission-critical servers in modern data centers or enterprises. Before a device leaves the manufacturing site, it’s crucial for the original design manufacturers (ODMs), OEMs and firmware suppliers to work together to ensure the firmware is attested. At AMI, we are committed to helping maintain firmware integrity throughout the supply chain.

  + [Zero Trust Firmware](/zero-trust-firmware/)
    - #### Zero Trust Security Starts with Firmware

      Zero Trust security is essential for protecting an organization’s infrastructure and business critical data in today’s digital transformation. But without secure firmware running on the infrastructure, Zero Trust strategy weakens significantly.

      From your car to airport kiosks and power grids, nearly all technology is powered by firmware and for that reason, firmware attacks are on the rise. Firmware attacks are much more dangerous than OS-based attacks because firmware is invisible to OS-based security solutions.

      AMI’s Zero Trust firmware security solutions can help maintain firmware integrity and strengthen organizations’ Zero trust strategy.

    - #### Empower Your Arm Devices With AMI Foundational Firmware

      As an Arm license partner, one of your main objectives is to bring your designs to the market as quickly and efficiently as possible. However, this process can be fraught with challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles you may encounter is in the development of firmware. Firmware is a critical component of your device, ensuring that it powers on, runs securely, and stays on during its lifecycle. Developing firmware that meets these requirements can be a complex and time-consuming task, but it is essential for the success of your device.

## Encryption Key for Secure Data Transmission

AMI recommends that you encrypt sensitive information to protect it from being viewed by unintended recipients. AMI can exchange emails with you using encryption. AMI highly suggests that you encrypt and decrypt email communications between AMI and yourself using an email client that supports encryption.

It is good security practice that you only trust ***validated encryption keys***. Do not trust encryption keys that have not been validated. It is important to also validate your copy of the AMI public encryption key to ensure it is legitimate.

## Summary

Binarly REsearch Team has discovered a arbitrary write vulnerability on Intel platforms allowing a possible attacker to execute arbitrary code during PEI phase.![Vendors Affected Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65d392ca924b59f0fcd873eb/6698dd226326f191c074ad7b_Vendors.svg)
### Vendors Affected

Intel[Intel](/advisory-vendor/intel),![Affected Products icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65d392ca924b59f0fcd873eb/6698dd3fad8b6d927d1b45c4_Affected%20products.svg)
### Affected Products

Intel Server Board M10JNP2SB
## Potential Impact

A potential attacker can execute an arbitrary code at the time of the PEI phase and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to the mitigasions bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory.

## Potential impact

A potential attacker can execute an arbitrary code at the time of the PEI phase and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to the mitigasions bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory.

## Vulnerability description

The pseudocode for vulnerable function is shown below:

```
int sub_FFEBFB2C()
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  DataSize = 4;
  S3PerformanceTablePointer = 0;
  Status = sub_FFEC0607(&EFI_PEI_READ_ONLY_VARIABLE2_PPI_GUID, &This);
  if ( Status >= 0 )
  {
    Status = This->GetVariable(
               This,
               L"FPDT_Variable_NV",
               &AMI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID,
               0,
               &DataSize,
               &S3PerformanceTablePointer);
    if ( Status >= 0 )
    {
      Status = S3PerformanceTablePointer;
      // Extracted from memory pointed by FPDT_Variable_NV variable value
      AcpiS3PerformanceTable = S3PerformanceTablePointer->AcpiS3PerformanceTable;
      if ( *S3PerformanceTablePointer->AcpiS3PerformanceTable == 'TP3S' )
      {
        if ( *&S3PerformanceTablePointer->ResumeCount )
        {
          if ( !AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.Header.Type )
          {
            S3ResumeTotal = MultU64x32(__rdtsc(), *&S3PerformanceTablePointer->ResumeCount);
            LODWORD(v3) = S3ResumeTotal;
            HIDWORD(v3) = HIDWORD(S3ResumeTotal) % 0xF4240;
            FullResumeLo = v3 / 0xF4240;
            FullResumeHi = HIDWORD(S3ResumeTotal) / 0xF4240;
            v6 = __PAIR64__(HIDWORD(S3ResumeTotal) / 0xF4240, FullResumeLo)
               + AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.AverageResume * AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.ResumeCount;
            ResumeCount = AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.ResumeCount + 1;
            LODWORD(v3) = v6;
            HIDWORD(v3) = HIDWORD(v6) % ResumeCount;
            Status = v3 / ResumeCount;
            AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.ResumeCount = ResumeCount;
            LODWORD(AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.AverageResume) = Status;
            HIDWORD(AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.AverageResume) = HIDWORD(v6) / ResumeCount;
            LODWORD(AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.FullResume) = FullResumeLo;
            HIDWORD(AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.FullResume) = FullResumeHi;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return Status;
}
```

The `AcpiS3PerformanceTable` pointer is controlled by the attacker: Â \* `S3PerformanceTablePointer` value is occured from value of `FPDT_Variable_NV` NVRAM variable Â \* `AcpiS3PerformanceTable = S3PerformanceTablePointer->AcpiS3PerformanceTable` (extracted from memory pointed by FPDT\_Variable\_NV variable value)

Thus the memory pointed to by `AcpiS3PerformanceTable` can be overwritten with predictable values:

```
AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.ResumeCount = ResumeCount;
LODWORD(AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.AverageResume) = Status;
HIDWORD(AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.AverageResume) = HIDWORD(v6) / ResumeCount;
LODWORD(AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.FullResume) = FullResumeLo;
HIDWORD(AcpiS3PerformanceTable->S3Resume.FullResume) = FullResumeHi;

```

This can lead to arbitrary write during the PEI stage.

The primitive described above allows to perform privilege escalation from the PEI to the DXE/SMM phase (or from PEI to the SMM during S3 sleep/wake up circle).In turn, code execution in PEI allows the disable security features that are initialized at the PEI-DXE junction (like PPAM or Intel BIOS Guard).
