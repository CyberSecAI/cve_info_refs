Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `/tour/admin/update_tax.php` file of the "Online Tours & Travels management system v1.0 by mayuri\_k". The vulnerability arises because the `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, a UNION based SQL injection is demonstrated.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before incorporating it into an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name, as demonstrated in the provided payload example.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful SQL injection can potentially lead to more severe attacks, such as data manipulation, privilege escalation, or complete system compromise depending on database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in the GET request to `/tour/admin/update_tax.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker must have some understanding of SQL to craft a working payload.
- **Targeted Endpoint Knowledge:** The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint (`/tour/admin/update_tax.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
- **No Authentication Needed:** Based on the provided details, authentication is not explicitly mentioned as required to trigger the vulnerability, but this may need further verification.
