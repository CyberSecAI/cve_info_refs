- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is an authentication bypass issue in IBM Maximo Asset Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is an authentication bypass vulnerability. The specific details of the bypass mechanism are not given.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application and its functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: The document does not specify the attack vector beyond that it is an authentication bypass.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document does not state specific attacker capabilities or position requirements beyond the ability to interact with the system's authentication mechanism to achieve bypass.

The document details a method to mitigate the vulnerability by enabling object structure security and setting the `mxe.int.enableosauth` property to 1.
