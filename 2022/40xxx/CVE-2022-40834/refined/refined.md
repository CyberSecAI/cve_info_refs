The provided content discusses a potential SQL injection vulnerability in CodeIgniter 3. The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of user-supplied input when used as database field names in  `_wh()`, `_where_in()`, and `_like()` functions.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the CodeIgniter framework does not filter or sanitize user-provided input when these inputs are used as database field names in the mentioned functions.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By directly using user input as database field names, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions depending on the context and database privileges.
*  **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to control or manipulate the user inputs that are used in the database functions to specify field names.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate input fields that are used to construct the SQL queries.

The discussion also mentions:

*   The vulnerability is due to careless programming rather than a flaw in the framework itself.
*   The issue is similar to an authentication bypass vulnerability in CI4 caused by an empty SQL WHERE clause. However, this specific issue is related to CI3.
*  The video referenced about an authentication bypass is related to CI4 and not CI3, though the underlying issue of using user-controlled input as column names in queries applies to both versions.
