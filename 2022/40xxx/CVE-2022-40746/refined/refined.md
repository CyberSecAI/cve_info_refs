- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to DLL hijacking. Certain features of IBM i Access Client Solutions, when run on Windows, leverage native code which is vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is not specified in detail but DLL hijacking can allow an attacker to execute malicious code on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when certain features of IBM i Access Client Solutions are executed on a Windows OS. An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable application will load it from. This implies a position on the file system, but details such as local/remote are not specified.
