- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (`$_POST['search_term']`) before using it in an SQL query, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability in `customer_transactions.php`. Specifically, the `$_POST['search_term']` is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain unauthorized access to the server, based on the database userâ€™s privileges. The provided example demonstrates a time-based SQL injection using `SLEEP(5)`.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `search_term` parameter within a POST request to `customer_transactions.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter. They do not need to be authenticated.
