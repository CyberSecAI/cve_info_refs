Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-40708:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the User Mode Hooking Monitor Engine. This results in a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer.
- Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read allows an attacker to read sensitive information from memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can read potentially sensitive data from memory.
- Privilege escalation: While the vulnerability itself does not directly lead to arbitrary code execution, it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required. The attacker needs to execute low-privileged code on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target machine.
