Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-40959:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that during iframe navigation, transient `about:blank` pages do not properly initialize their FeaturePolicy. Specifically, these pages do not call `Document::StartDocumentLoad()` where the policy is normally set up, and the FeaturePolicy isn't explicitly initialized in `nsDocShell::CreateAboutBlankContentViewer()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of FeaturePolicy initialization in transient `about:blank` documents. This results in a bypass of FeaturePolicy restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could leak device permissions into untrusted subdocuments. For example, a malicious iframe could bypass restrictions and hijack the top-level context's fullscreen permission.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves loading a page with an iframe. This iframe contains two blank subframes, one of which is stopped immediately with `window.stop()` to prevent it from loading and thus replacing the initial transient `about:blank`. The transient `about:blank` document, lacking FeaturePolicy initialization, can then be used to bypass restrictions, such as gaining access to the fullscreen API even if it should be blocked by FeaturePolicy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to load an HTML page with iframes. The attacker would also need some control over the iframe's content to be able to execute Javascript such as `window.stop()`. This could be achieved via a malicious website.
