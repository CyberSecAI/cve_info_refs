- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of X_B files. This can lead to a read past the end of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious X_B file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the parsing of such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted X_B file. User interaction is required (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page).
