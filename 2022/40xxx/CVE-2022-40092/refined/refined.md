Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `update_payment.php` file of the Online Tours & Travels management system. The application fails to properly sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as database name.
*   **Potential for more severe impact**: Depending on the database permissions, this could be used to modify data, escalate privileges, or even execute commands on the server, although this is not explicitly shown in the provided example. The provided payload shows information disclosure (database name) only.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `update_payment.php` script.
*   **URL Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`id` in `update_payment.php`) and how SQL injections work.
*   **No authentication required:** There is no mention of authentication required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/tour/admin/update_payment.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
*   **Database Name:** `tour1`
*   **Payload Example:** `/tour/admin/update_payment.php?id=1' union select 1,database()--+`
*   The provided payload leverages a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject a query that returns the database name.
