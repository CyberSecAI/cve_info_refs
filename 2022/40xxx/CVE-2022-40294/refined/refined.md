- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's data export functionality allows for the embedding of malicious code within the exported data. This code is then executed when the exported data is viewed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Incubated Vulnerability, specifically in the data export functionality. The application fails to sanitize or validate the data being exported, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The embedded malicious code is triggered upon viewing the exported data, potentially leading to various malicious activities, depending on the nature of the injected code and the viewer used.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the application's data export functionality, where an authenticated user can embed malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
