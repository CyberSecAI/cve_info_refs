The provided content relates to CVE-2022-40922.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a corrupted Mach-O file where the string table indices (`nlist[].str_idx`) within the `__LINKEDIT` segment are invalid, leading to an out-of-bounds access when the parser tries to dereference the string table using these corrupted indices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read/write due to corrupted string table indices
- Improper input validation when parsing Mach-O files
- Lack of checks for corrupted string table offsets

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted, corrupted Mach-O file as input to the LIEF library, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a maliciously crafted Mach-O file to be parsed by the LIEF library. This implies they have access to a system where the LIEF library is used. The attacker needs to be able to control the input file.
