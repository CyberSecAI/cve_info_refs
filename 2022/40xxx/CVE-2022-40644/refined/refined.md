**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of X_B files within Ansys SpaceClaim. This inadequate validation leads to a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation when parsing X_B files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially gaining full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted malicious X_B file.
- The target must interact with the malicious content by either visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious X_B file.
- The attacker must induce a user to open the malicious file with Ansys SpaceClaim.
