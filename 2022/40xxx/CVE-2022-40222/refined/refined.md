- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `m2m` binary's `DELETE_FILE` command within the Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD router constructs a command string using user-provided data from a UDP packet and executes it via the `system` function without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection. The `M2M_data_entry.data` field in the received UDP packet is directly incorporated into a command string without any input validation, allowing the injection of arbitrary OS commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution on the router, which can lead to full compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to the router's `m2m` service with a malicious payload in the `M2M_data_entry.data` field of the DELETE_FILE command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the vulnerable service on the router. No authentication is needed to trigger this vulnerability.
