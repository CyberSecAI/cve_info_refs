| Hi, I am Farhan, a professional cyber security researcher & penetration tester from Pakistan. I was reviewing the code of the transfer.sh and I found that it is possible to achieve Cross Site Scripting (XSS) on transfer.sh.  **Steps to Reproduce:**   * Create a file without any extension, example: "poc" * Add this HTML in this file "`<h3 onclick="alert('XSS')">click me</h3>`" * Save this file * Upload this file in the transfer.sh * You will get a url something like this: <https://transfer.sh/OHTwGK/poc> * Modify this url and add "inline" just after <https://transfer.sh/> * Now the url will look like this: <https://transfer.sh/inline/OHTwGK/poc> * Open this url in browser and click on the "click me" text and notice the prompt   **How to Fix it:** In the file /server/handlers.go find this code: line # 1035: <https://github.com/dutchcoders/transfer.sh/blob/main/server/handlers.go#L1035>  ``` if action == "inline" {       disposition = "inline" }  ```  Replace this code with the following to add proper content type:  ``` if action == "inline" {       disposition = "inline"       contentType := "text/plain" }   ```  **Proof Of Concept:** Open the following url and click on the "click me" text and you will see an alert popup, which confirms XSS. <https://transfer.sh/inline/OHTwGK/poc> |
