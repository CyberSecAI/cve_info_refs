- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `userid` parameter in the URL, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability is present in the `userid` parameter of the `/BabyCare/admin.php` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or even compromise the entire database by injecting malicious SQL code. The provided exploit payload demonstrates the ability to extract the database name. The identified SQL injection vulnerability can also be used to perform blind SQL injection, potentially allowing for further data extraction.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted GET request to `/BabyCare/admin.php` with a malicious payload injected into the `userid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and be able to modify the `userid` parameter of the `admin.php` file.
