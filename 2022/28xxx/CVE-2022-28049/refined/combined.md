Hi,

this bug was found by fuzzing the current master branch, to reproduce build the OSS-Fuzz harness with ASan and UBSan.

The bug is a write to a NULL pointer, this is the sanitizer report:

I attach the crashing testcase in a tar.gz, you can run it simply giving the testcase as first argument to the harness.

```
Previously, allocation of large array literals may result in
null-pointer dereference. The reason is that njs_array_alloc() may
return a slow array when size is large enough, but the instruction
code assumes that array is always flat.

The fix is to check fast_array flag before accessing array->start.

This closes [#473](https://github.com/nginx/njs/issues/473) issue on Github.
