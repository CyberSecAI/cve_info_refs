# Attendance and Payroll System using PHP/MySQLi Source Code

Submitted by [nurhodelta\_17](/users/nurhodelta2017 "View user profile.") on Tuesday, December 1, 2020 - 10:48.
Language
[PHP](/language/php)

 [![](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/nurhodelta_17/apsystem.png?itok=j4-j2KX2)](/sites/default/files/images/nurhodelta_17/apsystem.png)

This is a simple **Attendance and Payroll System** using **PHP and MySQLi-OOP** as **DB** driver. It has attendance on the client-side and payroll on the admin side. This system is written in pure **PHP** with no framework so it is understandable to **beginners**.

***\*Submitted: 02-2-18***

***\*Last Updated: 12-01-20*** (*tested in PHP version 7.2.33*)

## Features:

* **CRUD - Employee Attendance**
* **CRUD - Employee**
* **Employee Cash Advance**
* **Employee Overtime**
* **Employee Schedule**
* **Payroll on Date Range**
* **Payslip on Date Range**

## Plugins:

* **AdminLTE**
* **TCPDF library**

## Installation

1. Download the source code using the **Download** button below.
2. Extract the downloaded file to your localhost folder ex. **htdocs** for **XAMMP**.
3. Import the included .sql file which is the **database** of the system. If you have no idea how to import, please refer to my tutorial on [How import .sql file to restore MySQL database](https://www.sourcecodester.com/tutorials/sql/12049/how-import-sql-file-restore-mysql-database.html).
4. After a successful import, open the extracted folder and open **conn.php** in both the root folder and in **admin/includes** folder. Edit the database name in the connection depending on the name of **database** you created in importing the included .sql file.

## Accessing the Admin

You can access the admin side by adding **/admin/**. You should be able to navigate to the **admin login page**.

You can then use the below admin credential:

**Username:** nurhodelta

**Password:** password

That's it. You should now be able to run the simple system :)

## Installation and System Feature Demo Video

If you have any suggestions, comments, or reactions, feel free to comment below or message me.

Happy Coding :)

***\*Updates: 05-21-18***

1. *Fixed dynamic buttons **(edit, delete, etc )** not functioning on page2 or more of the **table**.*
2. *Fixed time in showing late even on time.*

***\*Updates: 12-1-20***

1. *Fixed dynamic buttons **(edit, delete, etc )** on page2 or more of the **table**.*

### [Dynamic buttons](/comment/90547#comment-90547)

Just change the button for edit and delete..
For edit:
$(document).on('click', '.edit', function(e){
e.preventDefault();
///the codes here
});
For delete
$(document).on('click', '.delete', function(e){
e.preventDefault();
///the codes here
});
Same goes for other dynamic buttons

<strong><h4>Manupilate the entire  document through this method</h4></strong>

<strong>1 </strong>Open the employee.php file using any text editor.

<strong>2</strong> Change the script inside the function

<strong>instead of getting one page</strong>

  $('.edit').click(function(e){

    e.preventDefault();

    $('#edit').modal('show');

    var id = $(this).data('id');

    getRow(id);

  });

<strong>Use the document query js.

</strong> $(document).on('click', '.edit', function(e){

    e.preventDefault();

    $('#edit').modal('show');

    var id = $(this).data('id');

    getRow(id);

### [tcpdf](/comment/104415#comment-104415)

The included tcpdf codes in the system are now deprecated. instead download the latest in github and replace the original tcpdf folder. It will run as-is just replace the old files.

### [OVERTIME PAY NOT INCLUDED IN THE PAYROLL AND PAYSLIP](/comment/104416#comment-104416)

Great coding. Just one small detail though...The overtime pay was not included in the computation for payroll nor in the payslip. Great work by the way.
