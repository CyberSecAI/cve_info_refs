Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `admin/employee_delete.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection because the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`id` parameter) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by using SQL injection techniques (e.g., using `SELECT` statements and `updatexml` function to retrieve data)
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database using injected SQL statements.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin/employee_delete.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- It appears the attacker needs to have access to the admin panel, although the provided exploit itself is possible without being logged in.

**Technical Details**

- The provided exploit uses the `updatexml` function in MySQL to extract the database name.
- The exploit uses the following payload in the `id` parameter: `id=7' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+&delete=`
- The `--+` comment is used to comment out the remaining part of the query after the injection point.
- The `0x7e` is the hexadecimal representation of the tilde character `~`, used to visually separate the extracted information.

**Additional Notes from the Comments:**

- Several users have reported issues with the system, including problems with:
  - Dynamic buttons (edit, delete) not working on paginated tables.
  - Time-in showing as late even when on time.
  - Issues with the TCPDF library.
  - Overtime calculation not being reflected in the payroll.
  - "Fatal error: Call to undefined function password_verify()" - this indicates the system might not be compatible with certain PHP versions.
