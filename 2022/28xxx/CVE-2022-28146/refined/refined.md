Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28146:

**CVE-2022-28146:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Continuous Integration with Toad Edge Plugin allows specifying an input folder on the Jenkins controller as a parameter to its build steps. This parameter is not properly sanitized.
*   **Weakness:** The plugin lacks proper input validation and sanitization for the input folder parameter used in its build steps. This allows attackers to specify arbitrary paths on the Jenkins controller file system.
*  **Impact:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission can read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller by providing a malicious path to the vulnerable parameter.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can configure a job to use the Continuous Integration with Toad Edge plugin and specify a path to a sensitive file on the Jenkins controller as the input folder.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs Item/Configure permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to configure a Jenkins job that utilizes the vulnerable plugin.

**Summary:** The Continuous Integration with Toad Edge Plugin fails to properly sanitize the input folder parameter, which allows an attacker with Item/Configure permissions to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.
