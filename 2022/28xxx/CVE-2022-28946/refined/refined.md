Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a parsing logic flaw in the Open Policy Agent (OPA) when handling "some" and "every" expressions. Specifically, the parser assumed that the domain of these expressions (`x in xs` or `x, y in xs`) would always be a `Member` or `MemberWithKey` call with a fixed number of arguments (2 or 3 respectively).  If a different function call, like `internal.member_2()`, was used as the domain, the parser would attempt to process it as if it were a valid domain expression, leading to a runtime exception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Argument Assumption:** The parser incorrectly assumes a fixed number of arguments for `Member` and `MemberWithKey` calls within the domain of "some" and "every" expressions.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The parser lacks proper input validation to verify if the provided expression conforms to the expected structure. This allows for unexpected function calls as part of the domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Runtime Exception:** Providing an invalid domain for a "some" or "every" expression triggers a runtime exception when attempting to parse. This could potentially be leveraged to cause denial-of-service, or to trigger unpredictable behavior in applications using OPA.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** By crafting a Rego policy containing "some" or "every" expressions with invalid domain expressions, such as `some internal.member_2()`, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide custom rego policy:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted rego policy to the OPA instance to trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The fix involves adding checks within `parseSome` and `parseEvery` functions to validate the number of arguments for `Member` and `MemberWithKey` calls.

Specifically:

*   In `parseSome` function, if the call is not `Member` or `MemberWithKey`, the parser will return an error with message "expected `x in xs` or `x, y in xs` expression". If call is a `Member` and length is not 3, or `MemberWithKey` and length is not 4, it will return an error with "illegal domain".
*   In `parseEvery` function, if the call is `Member` and length is not 3, or `MemberWithKey` and length is not 4, it will return an error with "illegal domain".

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message credits Norbert Szetei of Doyensec for reporting this issue.
*   The fix includes additional tests in `parser_test.go` to verify that the vulnerability is addressed and that invalid domains produce the expected error message.
