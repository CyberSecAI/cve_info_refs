ast/parser: guard against invalid domains for "some" and "every" ([#4548](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4548))

```
These would cause a runtime exception when attempting to parse

    some internal.member_2()

This is due to a technicality in how

    some x in xs

is parsed: `x in xs` will first become `internal.member_2(x, xs)`,
and `some internal.member_2(x, xs)` is then further processed. The
assumption that there're always two (resp. three for internal.member_3)
arguments won't hold if a snippet like the one above is fed into
the parser.

Thanks to Norbert Szetei of Doyensec, [@doyensec](https://github.com/doyensec), for reporting this.
