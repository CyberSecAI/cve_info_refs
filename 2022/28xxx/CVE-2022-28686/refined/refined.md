Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the software loading a library from an unsecured location. Specifically, it occurs when handling APP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The application loads a DLL from a location that is not secured or properly validated, making it susceptible to malicious DLL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This can lead to complete control of the affected system.
*  **Privilege Escalation:**  The vulnerability may allow privilege escalation since the attacker can execute code in the context of the process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious APP files:** An attacker can craft a malicious APP file that, when opened by the vulnerable software, triggers the loading of a malicious library.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically the victim must open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access to the File System:** An attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in an uncontrolled location.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious APP file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP1 and all prior versions (formerly known as InduSoft Web Studio).
*   AVEVA has released a fix for this vulnerability in HF 2020.2.00.40.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2022-28686
*   The CVSS v3.1 score is 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) which means it has high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
