SECURITY BULLETIN AVEVA-2022-005
Title
Multiple vulnerabilities in AVEVA Edge (formerly known as InduSoft Web Studio)

Rating
High

Published By
AVEVA Software Security Response Center

Overview
AVEVA Software, LLC. (“AVEVA”) has created a security update to address vulnerabilities in AVEVA Edge
2020 R2 SP1 and all prior versions (formerly known as InduSoft Web Studio). The vulnerabilities, if
exploited, could result in arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

Vulnerability Technical Details

1.  Unsafe Deserialization

The vulnerability, if exploited, could allow a malicious entity who tampers with project files to achieve
arbitrary code execution in AVEVA Edge.

CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
CVSS v3.1:  7.8 | AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2022-28685

2.  Uncontrolled Search Path Element

The vulnerability, if exploited, could allow a malicious entity with access to the file system to achieve
arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation by tricking AVEVA Edge to load an unsafe DLL.

CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element
CVSS v3.1:  7.8 | AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2022-28686, CVE-2022-28687, CVE-2022-28688

3.

Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference

The vulnerability, if exploited, could allow a malicious entity to cause a Denial of Service on AVEVA Edge
or to extract arbitrary files from the host machine on which AVEVA Edge is running.

CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
CVSS v3.1:  6.6 Medium| AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H
CVE-2022-36969

DATE: 08/18/2022

4.

Insufficient UI Warning of Dangerous Operations

Scripting capability is provided in AVEVA Edge to enable end-user customizations at runtime. The code
that can be executed in scripts is intentionally unrestricted. A malicious user could abuse the scripting
feature to achieve arbitrary code execution.

CWE-357: Insufficient UI Warning of Dangerous Operations
CVSS v3.1:  7.8 | AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2022-36970

Recommendations
AVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their
operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

Customers using AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP1 are affected and should apply HF 2020.2.00.40 as soon as
possible.
Customers using AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 and all prior versions (formerly known as InduSoft Web Studio)
are affected and should first upgrade to AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP1 and then apply HF 2020.2.00.40 as
soon as possible.

In addition to applying the security fix, the following general precautions should be taken throughout
the lifetime of AVEVA Edge projects:

-  Access Control Lists should be applied to all folders where users will save and load project files

-  Maintain a trusted chain-of-custody on project files during creation, modification, distribution,

and use

-

Train users to always verify the source of a project is trusted before opening or executing it

Starting with HF 2020.2.00.40, AVEVA Edge is introducing the following security enhancements:

-  When a user selects a project file to open, a warning will be presented asking the user if the

project can be trusted. The choice is remembered per project and applied to future operations.

-  Newly created projects will use a safe serialization mechanism. Projects created in

HF2020.2.00.40 are not backward compatible with AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP1 and all prior
versions (formerly known as InduSoft Web Studio).

-

Legacy projects that are opened in HF2020.2.00.40 and saved will be migrated to use a safe
serialization mechanism. After a project is migrated it will not be backward-compatible with
AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP1 and all prior versions.

For additional detail please refer to the supplied help file in HF 2020.2.00.40.

NVD Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3.1)
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has adopted the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS v3.1) that provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT
vulnerabilities.  CVSS v3.1 produces a numerical score as well as a textual representation of that score
reflecting the severity of a vulnerability.  Scores range from 0.0 (no impact) to a maximum of 10.0
(critical impact with minimal effort to exploit). For additional information please refer to the CVSS v3.1
specifications.
