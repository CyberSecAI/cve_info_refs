### **[hdthky](/hdthky)** commented [Mar 24, 2022](#issue-1179466461)

| Description Whilst experimenting with `htmldoc`, built from commit [31f7804](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/htmldoc/tree/31f780487e5ddc426888638786cdc47631687275), we are able to induce a vulnerability in function `pdf_write_names` , using a harness compiled from `htmldoc/htmldoc.cxx`.  Because there is no bounds checking, a heap-based out-of-bound read will be triggered when the software encounters a malformed file, result in information disclosure or denial of service. Proof of Concept The POC is: [poc\_heap\_overflow1](https://github.com/hdthky/poc/raw/main/poc3/poc_heap_overflow1)  The command is: `./htmldoc --webpage -t pdf -f /dev/null poc\_heap\_overflow1  The ASAN report is:  ``` ================================================================= ==50540==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x6250000020f4 at pc 0x0000003cf241 bp 0x7fffffffaf90 sp 0x7fffffffaf88 READ of size 4 at 0x6250000020f4 thread T0     #0 0x3cf240 in pdf_write_names(_IO_FILE*) /work/libraries/htmldoc/htmldoc/ps-pdf.cxx:3589:39     #1 0x3cf240 in pdf_write_document(unsigned char*, unsigned char*, unsigned char*, unsigned char*, unsigned char*, unsigned char*, tree_str*, tree_str*) /work/libraries/htmldoc/htmldoc/ps-pdf.cxx:2301:5     #2 0x3cf240 in pspdf_export /work/libraries/htmldoc/htmldoc/ps-pdf.cxx:910:7     #3 0x39a254 in main /work/libraries/htmldoc/htmldoc/htmldoc.cxx:1291:3     #4 0x7ffff75070b2 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x270b2)     #5 0x2a051d in _start (/work/libraries/htmldoc/htmldoc/htmldoc+0x2a051d)  0x6250000020f4 is located 20 bytes to the right of 8160-byte region [0x625000000100,0x6250000020e0) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x31b6f9 in realloc (/work/libraries/htmldoc/htmldoc/htmldoc+0x31b6f9)     #1 0x3ddaf8 in check_pages(int) /work/libraries/htmldoc/htmldoc/ps-pdf.cxx:8859:24  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /work/libraries/htmldoc/htmldoc/ps-pdf.cxx:3589:39 in pdf_write_names(_IO_FILE*) Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c4a7fff83c0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c4a7fff83d0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c4a7fff83e0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c4a7fff83f0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c4a7fff8400: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0c4a7fff8410: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 fa fa[fa]fa   0x0c4a7fff8420: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c4a7fff8430: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c4a7fff8440: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c4a7fff8450: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c4a7fff8460: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07   Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb   Shadow gap:              cc ==50540==ABORTING  ``` Impact This vulnerability is capable of inducing information disclosure or denial of service. |

| It is a littile weird. Even if I turn off leak\_check\_at\_exit, I can still reproduce it. The compile command I used is: `CFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address" CXXFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure` |

| The causes of buffer overflow and memory leak are totally different. In theory, turning leak\_check\_at\_exit off or not doesn't affect the result. |

| [@hdthky](https://github.com/hdthky) I am well aware of the differences. Theory doesn't matter, actual run evidence shows a difference on three difference systems at my immediate disposal (iMac Pro running current macOS, Ubuntu VM on that system, and Ubuntu VM on an M1 MacBook Pro). No errors on macOS, different results on both Ubuntu VMs. |
