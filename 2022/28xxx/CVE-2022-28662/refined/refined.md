- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer occurs while parsing specially crafted .NEU files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information leak in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs when a user opens a specially crafted .NEU file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious .NEU file. Local access is required, and no privileges are required for exploitation (user interaction is required).
