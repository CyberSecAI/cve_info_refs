Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28149:

**CVE-2022-28149**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Plugin:** Job and Node ownership Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 0.13.0 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not properly escape the names of secondary owners. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious code by including it in the name of a secondary owner. This code is then stored and executed in the browser of users viewing the configured job or node.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation results in a stored XSS vulnerability. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' browsers within the Jenkins application. This could lead to various malicious activities like stealing credentials/session tokens, defacing the page, or performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs Item/Configure permission for a job or node where they can set secondary owners.

**Summary:**

The Job and Node ownership Plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it doesn't sanitize user input for secondary owner names, which an attacker with `Item/Configure` permission can exploit to execute malicious JavaScript in other users' browsers. As of the advisory, there was no fix available for this issue.
