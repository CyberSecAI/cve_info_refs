The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Attendance and Payroll System v1.0" application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `position_edit.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of the `id` parameter. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically through the `id` parameter in `position_edit.php`. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can use the vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the provided payload which extracts the database name.
- Data modification/deletion: An attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- Privilege escalation: An attacker might be able to escalate their privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `apsystem/admin/position_edit.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
- Knowledge of the application's structure and the vulnerable parameter `id` is required.
- No authentication is needed for exploitation since the vulnerability is in an admin endpoint and there's no clear indication of a session being necessary (besides PHPSESSID cookie)

**Additional Information:**

- The content provides a specific vulnerable file (`admin/position_edit.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
- It includes a sample HTTP POST request with a SQL injection payload, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The payload leverages `updatexml` to extract the database name, showcasing the potential for database information disclosure.
- The vulnerable application is identified as "Attendance and Payroll System v1.0" from sourcecodester.com.
- The exploit is easily reproducible using the given information.
