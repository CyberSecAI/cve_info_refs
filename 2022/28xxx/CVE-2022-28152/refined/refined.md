Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28152:

**CVE-2022-28152**

*   **Root Cause:** The Job and Node ownership Plugin does not enforce the use of POST requests for a specific HTTP endpoint.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The absence of a requirement for POST requests allows an attacker to trigger actions by tricking a user's browser into sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to restore the default ownership of a job. This could lead to a loss of control over the job or disruption of its intended function, possibly leading to further attacks.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking a user's browser to make a request to the vulnerable endpoint. An attacker can exploit this via crafted links/images, etc..

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need specific user privileges in Jenkins for the attack to be successful. The user is required to have an active session in the Jenkins system, thus the attacker can trick a logged in user to execute the request.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability exists in Job and Node ownership Plugin version 0.13.0 and earlier.
* As of the advisory's publication date, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
