Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-28140:

**Vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

**Root Cause:** The Flaky Test Handler Plugin does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. It allows parsing of XML documents without disabling external entity resolution, which enables an attacker to inject malicious XML that references external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XXE Injection:** The core issue is the plugin's failure to disable external entity resolution in the XML parser it uses. This allows processing of XML documents with external entity declarations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the Jenkins controller's file system by referencing local files through external entities.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker can make Jenkins perform requests to internal or external systems the controller has access to by using external entities with URLs. This can be used to scan internal network resources or exfiltrate data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted XML Files:** Attackers can inject malicious XML content with external entity definitions into files parsed by the Flaky Test Handler plugin, potentially during build processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Item/Configure Permission:** An attacker needs Item/Configure permissions to be able to control the configuration of Jenkins jobs using the Flaky Test Handler, which allows them to provide the crafted XML input files.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Flaky Test Handler Plugin version 1.2.1 and earlier.
*   Flaky Test Handler Plugin version 1.2.2 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser, thus fixing the vulnerability.
*   The provided content contains more detail than the official CVE description, including the specific plugin affected, the exact mechanism of the vulnerability, and the required permissions for exploitation.
