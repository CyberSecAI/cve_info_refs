Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input in the `view_facility.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter from the GET request is directly embedded into the SQL query without any form of escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. The application is vulnerable to both boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker could leverage the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, personal information, or other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might modify or delete data stored in the database.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation of this SQL injection can be a stepping stone to further attacks on the server or application.
- **Application takeover:** Through database manipulation, it could be possible for an attacker to take over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted GET request to the `view_facility.php` script with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located on line 3 of `/scbs/view_facility.php`:
  ```php
  $qry = $conn->query("SELECT f.*, c.name as category from `facility_list` f inner join category_list c on f.category_id = c.id where f.id = '{$_GET['id']}' ");
  ```
- The provided SQLmap command can be used to verify the vulnerability.
- Both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques can be used for exploitation.
- The application is susceptible to remote exploitation.
