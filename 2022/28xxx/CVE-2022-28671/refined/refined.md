    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-28671",
    "cve_description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of Doc objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation of a 'Doc' object's existence before performing operations on it.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Use-After-Free",
          "Lack of input validation"
        ],
         "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current Foxit PDF Reader process.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Visiting a malicious web page",
          "Opening a malicious file"
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or webpage that triggers the use-after-free condition on 'Doc' objects.  User interaction is required for the exploit to work."
