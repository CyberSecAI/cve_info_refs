The provided document is an Adobe Security Bulletin (APSB22-16) that details multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-28266:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-28266
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Out-of-bounds Read ([CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html))
*   **Vulnerability Impact:** Memory Leak
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 5.5
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**Explanation**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** An out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) exists in the affected versions of Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a memory leak. While it's not arbitrary code execution, it could potentially expose sensitive information present in the memory region that is being read.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). This suggests the attacker needs to have access to the system locally. The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system, and the user has to perform an action (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not require any privileges on the system (PR:N).

**Summary**

CVE-2022-28266 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability that could result in a memory leak. It is classified as an Important severity vulnerability and has a CVSS base score of 5.5. The vulnerability is triggered by a user interaction.
