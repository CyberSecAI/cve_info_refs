- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in `admin/ajax/navigation.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data modification, deletion or exfiltration. This could lead to a complete compromise of the application's data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `/admin/ajax/navigation.php` with a crafted `id` parameter, injecting SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker does not require any special privileges beyond this.
