Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-28302:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files within Bentley MicroStation CONNECT.
- Specifically, crafted data within an IFC file can trigger a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the designated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code within the context of the current process running MicroStation CONNECT. This can lead to complete system compromise if the user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious IFC file: The primary attack vector involves delivering a specially crafted IFC file to the target.
- User interaction required: The user must either open the malicious IFC file using Bentley MicroStation CONNECT, or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious IFC file with crafted data designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
- The attacker must deliver the crafted IFC file or a malicious web page to a user of the vulnerable software. The attacker does not need any special access or privileges within the target environment.
