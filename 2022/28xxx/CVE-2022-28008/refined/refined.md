The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `attendance_delete.php` file of the Attendance and Payroll System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input being directly used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the POST request is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL DELETE query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, or other personal data.
- Data Modification: An attacker can modify or delete data in the database, potentially causing loss of data or application malfunction.
- Unauthorized Access: Through SQL injection, an attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database and perform actions that are not permitted to regular users.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `attendance_delete.php` file.
- Malicious Payload: The malicious SQL injection payload is included in the `id` parameter of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the application.
- HTTP knowledge: The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests to be able to craft the malicious payload.
- SQL knowledge: The attacker needs SQL knowledge to formulate the malicious payload to perform desired actions in the database.
