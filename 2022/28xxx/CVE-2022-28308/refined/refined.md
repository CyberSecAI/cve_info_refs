Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Bentley View parses 3DS files. Specifically, crafted data within a 3DS file can trigger a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the application's memory.
- The advisory from ZDI mentions that this vulnerability could be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted 3DS file. This could be achieved by:
   - The target visiting a malicious page.
    - Opening a malicious 3DS file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious 3DS file.
- They must also convince a user of Bentley View to open this file.
- User interaction is required for exploitation (opening the malicious file).
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be in a specific network position (local access is sufficient).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Bentley View versions 10.16.02.\* and prior.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2022-01-21.
- Bentley has released a fix in versions 10.16.03.\* and later.
- The same root cause affects other Bentley products, including MicroStation.
- The CVSS score is 3.3, with an AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N vector.
