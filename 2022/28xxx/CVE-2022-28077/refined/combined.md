The lender on this particular transaction however, (Quorum) was absolute trash. Grover had to apologize to us multiple times for the action and attitude of Quorum. Because of this, we once again feel that Grover is a stellar human being and took care of us once more when we were feeling most vulnerable. We will never recommend Quorum to anyone in our lives though. They were rude, unorganized and quite frankly they were offensive in some of their questioning. Grover consistently had our back and took the time to explain the why and what of each offensive question or requrest. Despite the negative feelings we have towards Quorum, we still have 100 percent trust in Grover and his team at Fairway. HUGE shout out to Heidi for putting up with us and not taking our frustrations personal. She is super knowledable and we appreciate all of her hard work and understanding!JenniferBroomfieldCO**Date:** 1/13/2025![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/60b8fb458e70e017cee4b863/61b36a5bc5fd03dd3fbe70ec_icon-social-experience.svg)5![5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b8fb458e70e017cee4b863/6258b34b9ef6f441e6aa8a2f_5%20Stars.svg)Helped us closed early and made sure everything was good bef we even got the houseJuanTopekaKS**Date:** 1/13/2025![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/60b8fb458e70e017cee4b863/61b36a5bc5fd03dd3fbe70ec_icon-social-experience.svg)5![5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b8fb458e70e017cee4b863/6258b34b9ef6f441e6aa8a2f_5%20Stars.svg)The quick effective communicationOliviaPensacolaFL**Date:** 1/13/2025![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/60b8fb458e70e017cee4b863/61b36a5bc5fd03dd3fbe70ec_icon-social-experience.svg)![Back Button - Reviews Toggle](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b8fb458e70e017cee4b863/60b8fb458e70e0e1cde4b8c4_icon-media-play.svg)[Show More Reviews](/about-us/testimonials)![Forward Button - Reviews Toggle](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b8fb458e70e017cee4b863/60b8fb458e70e0e1cde4b8c4_icon-media-play.svg)[More Reviews](https://pro.experience.com/pages/company/fairway-independent-mortgage-corporation-1300)
