Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-28688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The application loads a library from an insecure location. Specifically, the vulnerability lies within the handling of APP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading:** The application doesn't properly control the search path for loading DLLs, allowing it to load a malicious DLL from an attacker-controlled location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process by tricking the application to load a malicious DLL.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The AVEVA advisory mentions privilege escalation, though ZDI advisory doesn't explicitly state privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** Attackers need to have access to the file system to place the malicious DLL.
*   **User Interaction:** The target user needs to open a malicious APP file or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File system access:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable application will load it from.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The AVEVA advisory mentions this vulnerability is related to CVE-2022-28686 and CVE-2022-28687, suggesting they share a common root cause or are related to the same vulnerability class. However, each CVE was assigned to different researchers.
*   The ZDI advisory specifies that user interaction (opening a malicious file/visiting a malicious page) is required for exploitation.
*   The fix involves implementing secure library loading practices, and users are advised to update to the specified hotfix.
