Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of OBJ files within Bentley MicroStation CONNECT and related applications.
- The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a fixed-length, stack-based buffer. This allows for a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow
- Insufficient input validation of the size of user-supplied data when parsing OBJ files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Bentley MicroStation CONNECT.
- Successful exploitation leads to code execution in the context of the current process. This could result in complete control of the application and potentially the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves opening a maliciously crafted OBJ file with an affected version of MicroStation or MicroStation-based application.
- User interaction is required: The target must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious OBJ file.
- The attacker needs to get a user to open the malicious OBJ file using a vulnerable version of Bentley MicroStation CONNECT or a related application.
- No special access is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-22-595/ZDI-CAN-16174.
- It's also identified with Bentley ID BE-2022-0008.
- The vulnerability affects MicroStation and Bentley View versions 10.16.02.* and prior versions.
- Patched versions are 10.16.03.* and more recent.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 7.8, with the vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates a high-severity vulnerability that can be exploited locally with user interaction, resulting in a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
