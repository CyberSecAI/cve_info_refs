Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28366:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a denial-of-service (DoS) issue in certain Neko-related HTML parsers, specifically how they handle crafted Processing Instruction (PI) input. This leads to excessive heap memory consumption, causing the parser to become unresponsive.
- The underlying cause is within the CyberNeko HTML library and its forks, which are used by other software like AntiSamy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The vulnerability is an uncontrolled resource consumption issue where the parser uses an excessive amount of heap memory when processing malicious input.
- **Parsing Vulnerability:** The core issue is with how the parser handles certain processing instructions, allowing for a denial-of-service condition.
- **Use of vulnerable component:** Vulnerable versions of CyberNeko HTML library and its forks are used in the affected products.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service condition, making the affected software unresponsive.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The excessive heap memory consumption can cause the system running the affected software to slow down or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:**  The attack vector is network-based, indicating the attacker can send malicious input over the network to trigger the vulnerability
- **Malicious HTML Input:** The attack is achieved by providing a crafted HTML input with malicious processing instructions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network requests/data to the vulnerable service or software.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require any prior authentication and can be triggered by any user on the network.
- **Ability to Craft Input:** The attacker must be capable of creating a malicious HTML input with specific processing instructions designed to trigger the vulnerability in the vulnerable parser.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The CVE description explicitly mentions that CyberNeko HTML through 1.9.22 is affected and that this version is no longer maintained.
-   HtmlUnit-Neko versions before 2.27 are also vulnerable, and the issue is fixed in version 2.27.
-   OWASP AntiSamy versions before 1.6.6 are affected due to their use of the vulnerable CyberNeko library.
-   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2022-24839.
-   The fix involves upgrading to a patched version of the underlying HTML parsing library.
-  The github page indicates that AntiSamy upgraded to HtmlUnit-Neko version 2.60.0 in release 1.6.6 to resolve the issue.
