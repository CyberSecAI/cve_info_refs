Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-28588:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of input sanitization/filtering of user-supplied data, specifically when adding movie names. This allows malicious code to be stored in the system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not filter parameters when adding movie names, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of other users who access the vulnerable functionality. This may lead to account hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code when adding or updating a movie name within the application's backend.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to add or modify movie names within the vulnerable application. This may require a legitimate account with sufficient privileges or be exploitable without authentication. The attacker does not need direct access to the server to inject the payload.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content also includes screenshots of the vulnerability being tested:
  -  The first image shows a movie name with injected malicious code.
  -  The second image shows the successful execution of the injected JavaScript.
  -  The third image highlights the lack of parameter filtering as the main reason for the vulnerability.
- The affected version is stated as <=1.2.
