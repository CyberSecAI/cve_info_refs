Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload and execute custom LUA scripts (plugins) on Tekon SCADA controllers. These scripts are executed with root privileges, allowing an attacker to escalate from an authenticated admin user to root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Plugin Handling:** The system allows the upload of custom LUA scripts, which can contain arbitrary code.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** LUA scripts execute with root privileges, regardless of the user uploading the script, enabling privilege escalation.
*   **Default Credentials:**  Many devices use default "admin:secret" credentials, enabling initial access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected devices, including potentially shutting them down.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers gain root access, giving them complete control over the system.
*   **SCADA System Disruption:**  Exploitation could potentially disrupt or shut down critical infrastructure and SCADA systems.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could access sensitive information on the controllers.
*   **Malware Installation:** The ability to execute arbitrary code allows installation of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed by uploading a malicious LUA plugin through the web interface.
*   **Network Access:** The devices are accessible via the internet on port 80 (HTTP) , some with SSH enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface (e.g. by being on the same network or having internet access to the exposed devices).
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid login credentials for an administrative account or, if default credentials are used, no authentication is needed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected devices are manufactured by Tekon.ru and primarily used in the Russian market.
*   A Shodan search query was used to identify publicly exposed devices.
*   The vulnerability is present in the device's firmware or software that allows LUA plugin upload.
*  The attacker utilizes a custom LUA script that calls `os.execute` to run OS commands.
