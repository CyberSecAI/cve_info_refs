Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-28079

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization or validation of the `course_code` parameter in the `/College-Management-System/admin/asign-single-student-subjects.php` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, a boolean-based blind SQL injection vulnerability is present. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `course_code` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Compromise of the application: Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain control of the application.
- Data access: Attackers could access sensitive data stored in the database.
- Data modification: Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
- Exploitation of underlying database vulnerabilities: Attackers could potentially exploit further vulnerabilities in the database software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/College-Management-System/admin/asign-single-student-subjects.php` page.
- Injection of malicious SQL code via the `course_code` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable page (`/admin/asign-single-student-subjects.php`).
- Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, using tools like Burp Suite.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax and database structure to craft effective injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `course_code`
- A sample boolean-based blind SQL injection payload is provided: `submit=Press&roll_no=3&course_code=-6093' OR 2121=2121 AND 'ddQQ'='ddQQ`
- A sample Burp Suite request is also included demonstrating the vulnerable parameter within a POST request.

**Additional Notes**

*   The github repository specifically mentions that the vulnerability is an "Authenticated SQL injection".
*   The provided content confirms that the vulnerability exists in the College Management System application.
*   The github content gives a clear proof of concept of how to exploit the SQL injection.
