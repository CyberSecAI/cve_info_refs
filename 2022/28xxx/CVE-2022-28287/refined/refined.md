Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-28287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from incorrect text selection caching behavior in specific, unusual circumstances. This incorrect behavior occurs when the Input Method Editor (IME) interacts with Firefox, particularly when selecting text with Ctrl+A on certain content. Specifically, the `ContentCacheInParent` had different text lengths for the selection and the text itself, and  the `IMEContentObserver` was not updating the selection cache before sending a text change notification. This led to an invalid selection being reported to the Text Services Framework (TSF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Text Selection Caching:**  The core issue is a flaw in how Firefox caches and manages text selection data, particularly in scenarios involving the IME.  When a text change occurs, the selection data becomes inconsistent with the actual text data.
- **TSF Interaction Failure:** When TSF queries for text and selection information, it receives invalid data, and Firefox returns `E_FAIL` from `GetText()`.
- **Uncaught Exception/Crash:**  Microsoft's TSF does not handle the `E_FAIL` error condition correctly, leading to a `RaiseFailFastException` crash due to a corrupted stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the Firefox browser. While this is disruptive, it is not considered a severe security issue because users can restart the browser. The crash results from a `RaiseFailFastException` that Windows interprets as the process being compromised beyond repair, leading to immediate termination.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation (Speculative):**  While not explicitly demonstrated, there's an implication that this issue might have been used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities for more severe impacts. However, the primary known impact is the denial of service crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted Web Content:**  An attacker could craft web content (like the JIRA ticket data described) that triggers the specific text selection behavior that leads to the crash.
- **JavaScript manipulation:** A javascript code can also be used to make the victim press Ctrl+A over the vulnerable content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to deliver content to Firefox:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious web content to a user's Firefox browser. This could be through a malicious website, an injected iframe, or any other method that allows the attacker to display content in the victim's browser.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user selects text (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+A) within a specific content context.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug was initially reported by an external researcher and was assigned a low security severity due to the primary impact being a crash.
- The root cause was identified to be related to the  `ContentCacheInParent` having different length text for selection and text, and the  `IMEContentObserver` not updating the selection cache before sending a text change notification.
- The fix involved correcting the text selection caching and interaction with the IME, detailed in [bug 1746104](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1746104) and [bug 1752956](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1752956)
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 99.
- This vulnerability is not considered exploitable beyond a denial of service attack, and was therefore not eligible for Mozilla's bug bounty program.
