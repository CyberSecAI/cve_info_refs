- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `blur-save.php` script in Atom.CMS is vulnerable to SQL injection. The script does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. User-supplied parameters `action`, `db`, and `id` are directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This allows them to read or modify data in the database. With sufficient privileges, an attacker could delete tables or drop entire databases.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user can craft a specific HTTP GET request to `admin/ajax/blur-save.php` with manipulated `action`, `db`, and `id` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, `admin/ajax/blur-save.php`, of the Atom.CMS application. The attacker also needs some knowledge of how SQL queries are constructed in the backend. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
