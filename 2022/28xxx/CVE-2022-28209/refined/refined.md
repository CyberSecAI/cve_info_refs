  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An inverted check for the 'override-antispoof' permission in the AntiSpoof extension.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect permission check logic"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could potentially allow users to bypass anti-spoofing checks when creating accounts, but the provided text suggests that the faulty code path is only used for displaying UI messages, and not for the actual account creation.  The information indicates that it is not reproducible on Wikimedia wikis because those checks are handled by different code.",

      "Manipulating account creation process"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to interact with the account creation process",
        "Ability to bypass checks related to the 'override-antispoof' permission."
    ]
  },
    "additional_notes": "The issue was introduced by accidentally removing a negation operator in the code. Patches were created and merged to fix the issue in multiple branches (master, REL1_36, REL1_37, REL1_38)."
