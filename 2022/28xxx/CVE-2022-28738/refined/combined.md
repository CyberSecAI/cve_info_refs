| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1198440#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2022-04-13 09:08:57 UTC  ``` CVE-2022-28738: Double free in Regexp compilation  Posted by mame on 12 Apr 2022  A double-free vulnerability is discovered in Regexp compilation. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-28738. We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby. Details  Due to a bug in the Regexp compilation process, creating a Regexp object with a crafted source string could cause the same memory to be freed twice. This is known as a “double free” vulnerability. Note that, in general, it is considered unsafe to create and use a Regexp object generated from untrusted input. In this case, however, following a comprehensive assessment, we treat this issue as a vulnerability.  Please update Ruby to 3.0.4, or 3.1.2. Affected versions      ruby 3.0.3 or prior     ruby 3.1.1 or prior  Note that ruby 2.6 series and 2.7 series are not affected. Credits  Thanks to piao for discovering this issue.

| [Description](#c0)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2022-04-12 13:35:31 UTC  ``` CVE-2022-28739: Buffer overrun in String-to-Float conversion  A buffer-overrun vulnerability is discovered in a conversion algorithm from a String to a Float. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-28739. We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby. Details  Due to a bug in an internal function that converts a String to a Float, some convertion methods like Kernel#Float and String#to_f could cause buffer over-read. A typical consequence is a process termination due to segmentation fault, but in a limited circumstances, it may be exploitable for illegal memory read.  Please update Ruby to 2.6.10, 2.7.6, 3.0.4, or 3.1.2.  Affected versions      ruby 2.6.9 or prior     ruby 2.7.5 or prior     ruby 3.0.3 or prior     ruby 3.1.1 or prior    CVE-2022-28738: Double free in Regexp compilation  A double-free vulnerability is discovered in Regexp compilation. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-28738. We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby. Details  Due to a bug in the Regexp compilation process, creating a Regexp object with a crafted source string could cause the same memory to be freed twice. This is known as a “double free” vulnerability. Note that, in general, it is considered unsafe to create and use a Regexp object generated from untrusted input. In this case, however, following a comprehensive assessment, we treat this issue as a vulnerability.  Please update Ruby to 3.0.4, or 3.1.2.
