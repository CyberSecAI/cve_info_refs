Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Page Title" field when adding a new page in the `admin/pages.php?action=add_new` section of the Pixelimity application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. It fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the "Title" field, before storing it in the database. The unsanitized data is then displayed, which results in the execution of the malicious script in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal user session cookies and hijack user accounts.
- **Phishing attacks:**  Attackers could redirect users to malicious sites, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the appearance of web pages, causing misinformation or damage to the application's integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the Pixelimity application. An attacker needs to access the `admin/pages.php?action=add_new` page, which is likely accessible to authenticated users with administrative privileges.
- **Malicious Payload:** The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload, such as `<script>alert(1)</script>`, into the "Title" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Pixelimity application to reach the vulnerable section.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable field:** The attacker needs to know about the "Title" field in the "Add New Page" section to target it.
