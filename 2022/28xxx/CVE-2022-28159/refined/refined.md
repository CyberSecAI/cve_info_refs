Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-28159:

**Root Cause:**
The Tests Selector Plugin does not properly sanitize the "Properties File Path" option when configuring "Choosing Tests" parameters. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The plugin does not escape user-provided input within a specific configuration field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the configured job.
- This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions within the Jenkins instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to configure a Jenkins job. This can be done via the Jenkins UI if the attacker has the required permissions.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the `Properties File Path` field of the "Choosing Tests" parameter of the Tests Selector Plugin.
- When a user views the job configuration, the stored JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have `Item/Configure` permission for a Jenkins job that uses the Tests Selector Plugin.
