# Webmail Messenger release notes

### 4.5.3.49 (2024-09-4)

Maintenance release

**Bug fixes**

* Fix mail templates

**New features**

* Add Ansible support for java system http proxy and additional system properties
* Add Ansible support for additional dnf configuration

**Technical changes**

* Fix accessibility issues (WIP) reported by WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) https://wave.webaim.org/
* Updaate RC to 1.6.9
* Add autocomplete=off to login password field

### 4.5.3.6 (2023-05-24)

Minor update of ciphermail-console, ciphermail-ansible and ciphermail-appliance-core package.

**Bug fixes**

* Fix high CPU usage for the console app when the ssh connection is terminated unexpectedly. The console app results
  in high CPU load if the ssh connection is terminated when the shell option is selected. This issue is more likely
  to happen on VMs running on Azure because Azure by default uses a very short TCP timeout value.

**Technical changes**

* RHEL8 upgraded to 8.8. [PRO/ENT]
* Ansible updated to 7.2. [PRO/ENT]
* Add support for Securosys HSM proxy. [PRO/ENT]
* Send email notification if update check fails. [PRO/ENT]

### 4.5.3 (2023-05-08)

**New features**

* Support changing the email logo from the GUI.
* Add haproxy Ansible role.
* Add Securosys primus HSM Ansible role.

**Technical changes**

* Mail templates now include a logo.
* Text areas for some pages now vertically scale better on high-res screens.
* Additional PDF settings menu item moved to "other" pull-down menu.
* Support changing certbot acme URL.
* By default, postfix master.cf is managed by Ansible. This can however be overridden by setting the following ansible
  variable to false: `common__manage_postfix_master_config`.

**Bug fixes**

* Fix password policy issue when using a weighted policy
  The check which checks that m (minimal match) should be less or equal to the number of rules was no longer correct
  because a password policy rule can define a weight > 1.
* Webmail login fails if email address ends with a space. Whitespace is removed prior to authentication.
* Fix German language for PDF page.
* Fix SRS bug when time slot overflows.

### 4.5.0-4.5.2 (N/A)

Version 4.5.0-4.5.2 were internal releases.

### 4.4.1 (2022-09-14)

**New features**

* Ability to configure static IPv4 or IPv6 address using Ansible.

**Technical changes**

* The Postfix master process configuration is now fully managed with Ansible.
* MariaDB cluster nodes now use a better-supported TLS method for state
  snapshot transfers.

### 4.4.0 (N/A)

Version 4.4.0 was an internal release.

### 4.3.0 (2022-09-06)

**New features**

* The Webmail Messenger user interface now has a dark mode.

**Technical changes**

* Update dependencies: update Bouncycastle to 1.71, Ansible to 5.4, Jetty to
  9.4.48, Roundcube to 1.6.0, PHP to 7.4.
* The Ansible playbook after a CipherMail package update now runs
  asynchronously.

**Bug fixes**

* The maximum message size enforced by the Webmail Messenger user interface is
  now automatically adjusted based on the MTA configuration. To change the
  maximum message size, simply edit the 'Message size limit' option in the MTA
  configuration and hit 'Apply'. You can optionally change the maximum
  attachment size as well, by going to Settings -> Webmail.
* Inrease console app heap size to 8 MB in order to prevent a (rare) crash of
  the CipherMail Console application.

### 4.2.4 (2022-05-31)

**Bug fixes**

* A recent systemd update resulted in the unexpected cleaning of temporary
  files that have not been written to in at least 10 days. Whenever this
  happened, the administrative web interface and user portal would become
  dysfunctional until restarted. This has been fixed by adding configuration
  that prevents systemd from periodically cleaning the temporary files used by
  the CipherMail frontend.

### 4.2.3 (2022-05-11)

**New features**

* Ansible playbook output now gets logged to /var/log/ciphermail-ansible.log
  and is included in support dumps.
* Add support for Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS).

**Technical changes**

* Update patched python3-dnf-plugin-post-transaction-actions package to version
  4.0.21-11.1.el8.

**Bug fixes**

* Fixed user portal two-factor authentication, which was broken since the 4.2.1
  release.
* Since update 4.2.1, the portal logo could no longer be updated (the
  default ciphermail portal logo was always shown).

### 4.2.2 (2022-05-04)

**Bug fixes**

* Pin MariaDB to custom CipherMail version <= 3:10.3.32-2.1 because MariaDB
  3:10.3.32-2 breaks State Snapshot Transfers.
* Pin python3-dnf-plugin-post-transaction-actions to the CipherMail-patched
  version of 4.0.21-4.1.el8. The Red Hat-provided version contains a bug that
  prevented actions from running under specific circumstances.
* Fixed an issue where an interrupted Ansible playbook did not result in a
  warning in the administrative web interface.
* Prevent DNF from restoring the default MariaDB Galera configuration. The
  default configuration conflicts with the CipherMail-provided configuration,
  causing the service startup to fail.

### 4.2.1 (2022-04-25)

**SECURITY fixes**

* CVE-2022-28218: The secret keys used by the Roundcube installation were
  inadequately protected, allowing a local attacker to circumvent two-factor
  authentication and possibly decrypt passwords. The secret keys will be
  automatically rotated after applying this update. This forces all users to
  log in again.

**New features**

* It is now possible to enable HTML message viewing and editing using Ansible.
  HTML mail is disabled by default in Webmail Messenger for enhanced security.
* The inactivity timeout of the administrative web interface can now be
  configured with Ansible.
* If an error occurs during Ansible playbook execution, the error will now be
  logged. A warning will also be shown in the administrative web interface.
* Nagios/Icinga check scripts are now provided for use with the CipherMail
  monitoring endpoints.
* Add support for monitoring MariaDB.

**Technical changes**

* The Roundcube configuration is now managed with Ansible.
* Upgrade log4j from version 1.2.15 to 2.17.1. Because of changes to log4j the
  logger levels can no longer be managed from the administrative web interface.
  We therefore removed this option. Log levels should now be set in
  conf/log4j2.xml. Changing the log level does not require a restart because
  the change will be applied automatically after 60 seconds.
* Use the configured webmail logo as the favicon for the user portal.
* Add HTML alternative part to the sign-up and new mail email templates.
* Update Roundcube to 1.4.13.
* Remove CipherMail Console log directory.
* Update dependencies: update jquery to 3.6.0, update HTTP client to 5.1.3,
  update cxf to 3.3.13, update XML sec to 2.1.7, update jasypt to 1.9.3,
  update wss4j to 2.2.7, update netty to 4.1.75, update spring to 5.3.18,
  update activeMQ to 5.16.0, update libphonenumber to 8.12.45.
* Make console script crash-proof, i.e., fallback to shell if console script
  fails.

**Bug fixes**

* Fixed downloading of multiple Webmail messages using a zip archive, which was
  broken since the 4.0 release.
* Fixed Roundcube logging, which was broken since the 4.0 release.
* Fixed an Ansible playbook warning regarding authorized SSH keys.
* The Webmail footer used to overflow edit fields when the screen size was too
  small.

### 4.2.0 (N/A)

Version 4.2.0 was an internal release.

### 4.1.4 (2022-02-09)

**Bug fixes**

* Microsoft recently shut down the Office 365 cloud components in Germany. This
  caused HTTP 400 errors to occur in the CipherMail web service client that
  obtained the Office 365 IP ranges through a Microsoft-provided API. This
  release removes the German API endpoint configuration from the web service
  client.
* On IPv4-only hosts, the Postfix MTA would in some cases attempt outbound
  connections over IPv6. These connection attempts would be put in caches and
  logs, which made it harder to troubleshoot connection problems.
* An error would occur when saving the mailbox expunge configuration. The
  script responsible for this action erroneously tried to save the
  configuration in the (old, no longer existing) `/etc/ciphermail-webmail`
  directory. In this release, the expunge configuration file is stored in
  `/etc/ciphermail` instead.

### 4.1.3 (2021-11-24)

**SECURITY fixes**

* The portal password policy functionality has been redesigned. A complex
  password policy can now be configured. The default portal password policy is
  set to require at least 8 characters. This is in accordance with the latest
  NIST password guidelines. The old "Min Password Strength" option has been
  removed. If "Min Password Strength" was set to a custom value, please make
  sure to revisit this configuration.
* Control characters and null characters now get removed from log output and
  subject headers. Because headers can be encoded (for example with base64),
  null values and control characters can be added to the subject and other parts
  of the message. Because of a bug in the Java wrapper, logging a null character
  can temporarily stop log output.
* Roundcube updated to 1.4.12.

**New features**

* Full IPv6 support. CipherMail products are now fully functional and supported
  in IPv4-only, dual-stack and IPv6-only networks. This includes cluster setups.
* More configuration can now be managed with Ansible: system timezone,
  authorized SSH keys, GRUB, serial console, IPv6 support, DHCPv6 client,
  passwordless sudo, custom Postfix options, additional trusted CA certificates
  and secure syslog forwarding.
* HTML email is now fully supported with PDF encryption. The PDF document will
  have similar-looking markup as the original HTML message. Inline images inside
  the email also end up in the PDF document. The PDF file is created from a
  configurable template and can be modified to match the corporate identity.

**Technical changes**

* The default playbook execution has changed. The new default is to execute the
  playbook only against the local machine. Any inventory changes you've made are
  now automatically synchronized to any other cluster nodes, and will be applied
  once the playbook is started on those hosts as well. This happens
  automatically on every CipherMail package update. You can run the playbook
  against all inventory hosts using the `--all-hosts` flag.
* Each Ansible play is now executed against one host at a time. Running the
  whole playbook now takes longer when managing a CipherMail cluster, but this
  prevents situations where a failure in the playbook affects the whole cluster.
* The Dovecot configuration is now completely templated.
* If a valid database connection cannot be established, the back-end service
  will now keep trying indefinitely.
* When a database connection is retrieved from the database pool, a check is
  done to verify whether the database connection is valid.
* We've added non-strict email address checking functions to EmailAddressUtils.
  Not all email addresses used in practice are valid according to RFC 2822. For
  example, email addresses are not allowed to end with a full stop. In practice
  however, most mail servers accept email addresses ending with that character.
  In situations where email checking is not required to be strict, the full stop
  will not be treated as an error.
* Because the password policy is now configurable, the portal pages where the
  password can be configured no longer show the password policy. A "password
  policy URL" option has been added which can point to a self-hosted page that
  can explain the configured password policy.
* Ansible playbook execution now utilizes SSH connection pipelining, reducing
  execution times by some 40%.
* All (feemarker) templates are now validated when saved. This requires that the
  template is safe for null values, i.e., if a variable is null, the variable
  should expand to a default value or not be used.
* All supplied (freemarker) templates are now null-value safe.
* PDF email templates now contain an alternative HTML part. Some parts of the
  PDF email templates can be modified (for example the logo URL and footer)
  without having to completely rewrite the template.
* Add `!syslog` and `!pam_session` to the default sudo setting for the back-end
  user to stop logging unnecessary messages to /var/log/messages.
* Remove deprecated SHA-1 admin password encoding. If the admin password was set
  in version <= 2.8.6 and the password was never changed, you need to reset your
  admin password.

**Bug fixes**

* MariaDB Galera cluster instance startup will now be delayed until the host is
  online (that is, the network-online systemd target has been reached). This
  prevents a situation where MariaDB would have to be manually restarted after
  a host reboot.
* CipherMail MPA and web logs were correctly saved by rsyslog, but were
  inadvertently excluded from syslog forwarding. This has been resolved.
* The Dovecot configuration could fail in some non-cluster configurations.
* Fix PAM lockout. Clicking the apply button on the 'Administrators' page caused
  the application to disable PAM logins, potentially locking out all
  administrators.
* DNS settings were not configured on RHEL 8.
* The Azure image would start with network configuration for both classic
  interface names and the new, systemd-style predictable interface names.
  Microsoft discourages use of the latter on Azure. We have modified our image
  building process so that only classic interface names are used for Azure
  images.
* The DigitalOcean image would start with network configuration for both classic
  interface names and the new, systemd-style predictable interface names.
  Predictable interface names actually work well on DigitalOcean. We have
  modified our image building process so that only predictable interface names
  are used for DigitalOcean images, just like our non-cloud images.
* Restarting the back-end from the GUI, resulted in a stopped back-end, i.e.,
  the back-end was not restarted.

### 4.1.0 - 4.1.2 (N/A)

Versions 4.1.0 through 4.1.2 were internal releases.

### 4.0.2 (2021-07-06)

**Bug fixes**

* The virtual appliance OVA file should not contain the nvram file because older
  vSphere Web Clients cannot import an ova file which contains an nvram file.
  vSphere Web Client error report: The "Deployed an OVF with NVRAM is not
  supported (incompatible vCenter version)."
* Fix for Securosys HSM data at rest encryption with keys generated on the HSM

### 4.0.1 (2021-05-28)

**SECURITY fixes**

* The TLS settings used by Postfix now exclude configurations that are deemed
  insufficient by NCSC-NL, like the SSLv3 protocol and RC4 encryption algorithm.
  Ref: [NCSC-NL TLS
  Guidelines](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2021/january/19/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-2.1)
* Patched JQuery 1.12.4 to fix all open security issues.

**New features**

* PAM authentication added to the administrative web interface. Administrators
  can now log in with their Unix credentials. PAM authentication can be disabled
  from the Admin page (after logging in) or by adding the properties file
  `conf/ciphermail-webmail.properties.d/disable-pam.properties` with content
  `pam.enabled=false`.

**Technical changes**

* The virtual appliance is now based on RHEL 8.
* CipherMail core packages (ciphermail-webmail, ciphermail-webmail-web) now
  require the ciphermail-core-os package. There are two packages that provide
  the new ciphermail-core-os dependency: ciphermail-core-os-no-deps and
  ciphermail-core-os-rhel8. When installing on RHEL 8 or CentOS Stream 8, use
  ciphermail-core-os-rhel8. In other cases use ciphermail-core-os-no-deps.
* The back-end log file is now written to
  `/var/log/ciphermail-webmail-backend.log`.
* The front-end log file is now written to
  `/var/log/ciphermail-webmail-frontend.log`.
* The Unix domain socket
  `/var/opt/ciphermail/run/postfix/cm-postfix-socketmap.socket:authorized-recipients`
  was moved to
  `/run/ciphermail/cm-postfix-socketmap.socket:authorized-recipients`. This
  requires changes to Postix main.cf (rc\_reply\_recipient\_restrictions
  setting). The update script will do this automatically for you.
* A default built-in administrative user is no longer created on first start.
  Administrators should log in with their Unix account after which they can
  configure a built-in administrative user if needed.
* The IP filter properties file was moved from
  `/etc/djigzo/ip-filter.properties` to
  `/etc/ciphermail/ip-filter/ip-filter.properties`. This required changes to
  the administrative web interface and console module.
* Replaced `service` commands with `systemctl` in all scripts. The back end
  should now be started with `systemctl restart ciphermail-webmail-backend` and
  the front end should be started with
  `systemctl restart ciphermail-webmail-frontend`.
* The graphs to show on the admin homepage are now read from a json file.
* Unix domain sockets are now placed in `/run/ciphermail` which is auto-created
  by the systemd service.
* The Unix domain socket
  `/usr/share/ciphermail-webmail/var/ciphermail-dict:ciphermail` was moved to
  `/run/ciphermail/ciphermail-dict:ciphermail`.
* ciphermail-dict group renamed to cm-dovecot.
* The restore function of the backup page is now only enabled if the user is
  logged in via PAM. i.e., with a Unix account. The additional system password
  field for restoring has been removed.
* Files from the application directory are now by default owned by root. Files
  and directories that should be owned by the back-end user are excluded.
* There is now only one build of the console app which is shared by the gateway
  and webmail messenger.

**Bug fixes**

* The Certbot manage script could no longer detect whether or not a Let's
  Encrypt certificate was available or not because the text returned by Certbot
  was changed. We now check whether the dir /etc/letsencrypt/live/ciphermail
  exists or not.

**Miscellaneous**

* Some password fields are now configured with autocomplete="new-password" to
  prevent autofilling.

### 4.0.0 (N/A)

Version 4.0.0 was an internal release.

### 3.4.0 (2020-11-24)

**New features**

* Unread email notification added. If enabled, it will periodically check if a
  user has unread mail. If so, a notification will be sent.

**Technical changes**

* Bouncy Castle jars updated to 1.67.
* Roundcube updated to 1.4.9.

**Miscellaneous**

* Logo color changed to match new color scheme.
* Templates are now sorted (with the exception of custom templates which always
  come at the end).

### 3.3.1 (2020-07-03)

**Bug fixes**

* Postfix now prefers IPv4 addresses. This slightly improves connection
  performance as IPv6 connection attempts (which are not yet supported in our
  products) are now skipped.
* The X-Forwarded-For header is now removed from all requests by default unless
  the request comes from a trusted proxy (see
  `/etc/httpd/conf.d/x-forward-for.conf`). This is done to improve logging
  accuracy.

### 3.3.0 (2020-06-11)

**New features**

* The administrator can override the default (root) target processor on the
  respool page.
* MTA "after queue filter size" and queue\_min\_free are now calculated based on
  the configured max mail size
* MTA "before queue filter size" renamed to "Message size limit" and "after
  queue filter size" removed from GUI
* Web GUI session timeout can be configured using the property
  ciphermail.gui.admin.max-inactive-interval
* Show error message "You are not authorized to send email to ..." if the
  webmail user sends an email to an unauthorized domain.

**Technical changes**

* The authorized recipients are now read from the database using
  postfixSocketMapService. This service uses a Unix domain socket that only
  allows access to the 'cm-postfix' group. The 'ciphermail-webmail' and
  'postfix' users must be members of this group to make use of this feature.
* Roundcube updated to 1.4.6.

**Miscellaneous**

* Logging improved for unacceptable emails (e.g. those with very large email
  bodies) that are sent from the back end.

### 3.2.0 (2020-05-27)

**SECURITY fixes**

* Fix for privilege escalation issue (CVE-2020-12713).
* Fix for weak Diffie-Hellman parameters (CVE-2020-12714).

A [patch
script](https://www.ciphermail.com/blog/ciphermail-cve-2020-12713_2020-12714.html)
for both vulnerabilities is available for users of older Webmail Messenger
versions.

**Technical changes**

* Java 8 or up is now required.
* CXF jars and their dependencies updated from 3.0.12 to 3.3.6.
* ECallSMSTransport2 with support for the new ECall API added.
* Roundcube updated to 1.4.4.

**Bug fixes**

* Certbot timer was not started.

**Miscellaneous**

* Docker Compose file added for unit tesing.

### 3.1.1 (2020-01-22)

**New features**

* Support for requesting certificates via ACME (Let's Encrypt) added.
* Wizard added which can be used to import a trusted system root certificate.
* Portal footer option added to global settings. The footer will be added to all
  portal pages (but not to the webmail page).

**Technical changes**

* Redirect rule added for redirecting '/' to '/webmail/'. We no longer need the
  index.html file to do this redirection.
* Dovecot prefetch is now supported and enabled. Now only one user lookup has to
  be done instead of two.

### 3.1.0 (N/A)

Version 3.1.0 was an internal release.

### 3.0.1 (2019-12-23)

**New features**

* The Webmail Messenger portal now uses a completely new skin based on Roundcube
  1.4's Elastic skin. This makes Webmail Messenger scale better on mobile
  devices.
* DKIM signing is now supported. It can be configured globally or for each
  domain individually.
* Webmail Messenger portal styles (like colors) can now be edited from the GUI
  to match the company colors.
* Logos modifiable by the administrator are now stored in a logo registry. A
  standard logo editor can now be used to add additional editable system logos.
* System sender and From addresses can now be specified. These addresses are
  used by some system-generated notification messages. The default system sender
  is the null sender. The default From address is 'postmaster'. The default
  email templates have been modified to reflect this change; From is set to
  'postmaster' if not overridden.
* The MPA log viewer now supports multiple log files. Previously only the last
  two MPA log files were shown. The admin can now select the number of log files
  to show, and filter on (up to 9 log files).
* The system URLs (Base URL, OTP URL etc.) can now be set on domain and user
  level. Previously this was only possible on the global system level.
* Special PDF subject and header trigger added (only used in 'standalone' mode).
* On the "Compose a test email" page, if the "deliver via webmail messenger"
  checkbox is selected, the email will be delivered via the back end and handled
  as if it was a Webmail Messenger email, i.e. the message will be delivered to
  the recipient's webmail inbox.

**Technical changes**

* Native NTLM client support is now disabled because only version 1 was
  supported, which is insecure and discouraged by Microsoft. If you need NTLMv2
  support, use the included cntlm proxy or an NTLM proxy of your choice.
* Notify and PDFEncrypt "userProperty" must now be a JSON string. If you have
  modified the standard config.xml file, or any other MPA XML fragment that uses
  Notify or PDFEncrypt and where "userProperty" is set, please update these XML
  files to make sure the new JSON configuration is used.
* Support for some obsolete browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer 8) has been
  dropped. The Webmail Messenger supports all browser versions that are
  supported by the latest Roundcube version.
* System jars updated for Java 11.
* The type of the cm\_value field of the cm\_properties\_cm\_name\_values table
  was changed to mediumtext in order to support larger values. This change only
  affects installations that use a MariaDB or MySQL DBMS.
* The max MPA log size is now 20MB (was 10MB). The log is rotated once it
  reaches this size.
* Packages are signed with a new signing key. The fingerprint of this key is
  034416869EBF877A9C37B22E81DD361DC65A8999.
* dnsjava upgraded to 2.1.9.
* All non-CipherMail package dependencies of the RPM and Debian packages are
  removed. This makes it easier for us to support multiple RedHat/CentOS and
  Debian/Ubuntu releases.
* Parts of properties code changed to improve multitenancy.

**Bug fixes**

* Email address highlighting was missing the '-' character in domain names.

### 3.0.0 (N/A)

Version 3.0.0 was an internal release.

### 2.6.0 (2019-09-12)

**New features**

* Additional email forwarding rules can now be added.
* ServerMode property added. You can now select ADD-ON (default) or STANDALONE
  to choose the desired Webmail Messenger deployment type. The separate
  standalone configuration fragment and script are no longer needed.
* PDF option "Use reply sender" added. If "Use reply sender" and "Reply sender"
  are set, the "Reply sender" email address is used as the sender of the PDF
  reply email.
* Wizards added: initial setup wizard, encryption setup wizard, TLS/SSL import
  wizard and more. The wizards make it easier to set up and configure Webmail
  Messenger.
* Every admin page now contains the admin menu, i.e., if you open an admin page,
  you no longer have to use the back button to select another admin option.
* Additional email forwarding rules can be added.
* For most pages and settings there is now a help button. If clicked, the online
  help page for that page/setting will be opened.

**Technical changes**

* Additional HTTP security headers added (Content-Security-Policy,
  X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Feature-Policy).
* The DNS and network configuration is now always reloaded in the background
  when initiated from the administrative web interface.
* Some pulldown menu items are now in sorted order (Settings/Other, Admin/Other
  and MTA).
* For most RPM spec config files, "%config(noreplace)" is replaced by "%config"
  (i.e, (noreplace) was removed).
* Domain validator is now more strict. A domain fragment cannot end or start
  with dot (.) or contain consecutive dots.

**Bug fixes**

* The TLS/SSL import page now allows an empty password.

**Miscellaneous**

* Improved layout of network, software and system update display.
* A PDF reply message will now contain an "X-CipherMail-Reply: true" header.
* Fixed sonarlint warnings.

### 2.4.2 (2019-05-01)

**New features**

* HTML/CSS refactored. Bootstrap HTML/CSS framework is now used for the web GUI.
  The web GUI is now responsive and scales on small mobile devices (iPhone, iPad
  etc.). Some menu items are now combined under one pulldown menu (S/MIME) and
  some menu items are moved. This was a major change because all GUI pages had
  to be updated.

**Technical changes**

* Startup script loads user override file
  /etc/default/ciphermail-webmail-override (if available).
* MimeEncodeHeaderMethod freemarker method added which can be used to
  MIME-encode a header to make it 7-bit safe.
* The back-end memory limit is now 16 GB instead of 2 GB.

**Miscellaneous**

* Logo in Webmail will now always fit (resize if needed)
* General cleanup (copyright statements, code cleanup etc.)

### 2.3.0 (2018-10-23)

**New features**

* System page now has a "Restart Web Server" button which will restart Apache
  (required if the SSL/TLS certificate is replaced).
* A red exclamation mark is now shown next to buttons on the System page whose
  services should be restarted.
* The admin pages are now proxied via Apache HTTP Server. If the SSL/TLS
  certificate is replaced, only Apache has to be restarted instead of the whole
  application, which is faster and does not invalidate existing logins. This
  change also makes it easier to support Let's Encrypt.
* Module added which can retrieve the IP ranges used by Gmail (SPF lookup) and
  Office 365 (Microsoft-provided web service). This is needed if you need to set
  up the Webmail Messenger to be used with Gmail or Office 365. A background
  cronjob will periodically check if there are updates to the IP ranges. Note:
  this module is disabled by default, enabling it requires command line
  interaction.
* System notifications can be configured to be sent by email to an
  administrator. For example, if the IP range used by Office 365 or Gmail is
  updated, or the license is about to expire, an email notification will be sent
  to the configured email addresses.
* Webmail Messenger can now be configured to add read receipt requests in the
  form of a `Disposition-Notification-To:` header. After enabling this feature,
  the webmail user interface will automatically send read receipts when the user
  first opens a message.
* The reply sender can now be rewritten to a preconfigured email address. If
  rewritten, the sender name field of the email address will be set to contain
  the original email address of the sender. See the feature's
  [documentation](https://www.ciphermail.com/documentation/webmail-administration-guide/settings.html#rewrite-reply-sender)
  for an example.
* The "New mail" and "Invite" notification sender can now be changed. This works
  in a similar way as the "Rewrite reply sender" option.
* Support for Clickatell Connect API (SMS transport) added.
* Factory properties can be set/overridden by placing property files in
  conf/ciphermail-webmail.properties.d.
* In standalone mode, it's checked whether the sender is licensed. If not, the
  sender will be notified and the message will not be handled. A notification is
  sent if 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the max licenses have been assigned. A
  license expiration warning is shown if the license is about to expire in 30
  days. A daily notification is sent if the license expires within 7 days.

**Technical changes**

* Postfix long queue identifiers are now enabled by default. The benefit of
  these longer identifiers is simpler log file analysis, because the queue IDs
  are only reused after a long time.
* MariaDB JDBC driver updated to 1.7.4.

**Bug fixes**

* Some image URLs and links did not take the port number into account if the
  webmail portal was externally reachable on a different TCP port.

### 2.1.2 (2018-06-07)

**Technical changes**

* TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 are now disabled. Only strong TLSv1.2 ciphers are enabled.
* Debian packages are now built for the amd64 architecture instead of i386.

### 2.1.1 (2018-06-01)

**New features**

* Clickjacking protection added. The web interface now adds an
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header.
* SMTP lookup tables can now be edited using the web interface.

**Technical changes**

* The password reset email no longer uses the null sender (<>). Some anti-spam
  systems block emails with an empty sender address.

**Bug fixes**

* 'Relay recipient' is no longer a required option. This change allows deploying
  Webmail Messenger as a standalone system.

### 2.1.0 (2018-05-08)

**New features**

* The back end now supports a mail attribute named
  `remote-delivery.smtp.relay-host`. It can be used to deliver mail to a
  different relay host or local service based on the message content.
* It is now possible to export the database in XML format.

**Technical changes**

* The Webmail Messenger virtual appliance is now based on CentOS 7 instead of
  Ubuntu and runs MariaDB instead of PostgreSQL. Unfortunately this means that
  backups of previous virtual appliances cannot be imported directly in Webmail
  Messenger 2.1.0+. Users with a support contract can contact us for help with
  migrating the database to the new version. Note: this change only impacts
  customers who wish to upgrade to the new CentOS-based virtual appliance.
* Jetty upgraded to release 9.4. This requires Java 8 or up.
* Postgres JDBC driver updated to support Postgres 10.
* Most dependencies have been removed from the Debian and Red Hat packages. This
  makes it easier for us to support different Debian and Red Hat/CentOS
  releases.
* SleepTimeOnError added to SMSGatewayImpl background thread. The thread will
  sleep for 30 seconds (configurable) if there was an exception in the
  background thread not caused by a transport. This is done to prevent filling
  up the logs if there is a problem with the database.

**Bug fixes**

* Cipher suites for HTTPClient are no longer set. The cipher suites
  configuration resulted in a bug after a Java update. This bug only affects
  Webmail Messenger installations that use a link to `sunjce_provider.jar` in
  `/usr/share/djigzo/james-2.3.1/lib`.
* Postgres 10 does not allow the JDBC URL to end with '/', which would cause
  database connectivity issues with Webmail Messenger installations after
  upgrading to that Postgres release. The last '/' has now been removed from the
  JDBC URL.
* SOAP communication between the front and back ends now uses HTTP Basic
  Authentication instead of Web Services Security to work around a
  recently introduced bug in Java 1.8.0\_162. Ref:
  https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8196491,
  https://github.com/javaee/metro-jax-ws/issues/1209
* The Webmail Messenger license was only checked during startup.

### 1.5.6 (2017-04-04)

**New features**

* PDF encryption now supports deep MIME scanning. This feature ensures that all
  attachments are included in the encrypted PDF file, which was not always the
  case for messages sent with Mac Mail. Ref: GATEWAY-89.
* `ciphermail.d/*.conf` added to Apache HTTP Server configuration. This can be
  used for things like custom skins and advanced web server options.

**Technical changes**

* Because some NIO classes are now used, Java 7 or up is now required.
* Multiple libraries updated.

**Bug fixes**

* The TOTP secret used for two-factor authentication failed to generate.

### 1.5.2 (2016-11-21)

**New features**

* Two factor authentication with SMS or TOTP (e.g. Google Authenticator) is now
  supported.
* SMS gateway added.
* Support for Twilio and eCall SMS gateway added.
* Auto cleanup service added. When enabled, webmail accounts which are not used
  for some time will be cleaned up automatically.

**Technical changes**

* Multiple libraries updated.

**Bug fixes**

* Minor bug fixes.

### 1.5.0 (2016-08-23)

**New features**

* The account portal can now be used to generate one-time passwords for
  decrypting PDF messages.

**Technical changes**

* The account portal now uses the Bootstrap CSS framework.
* MySQL/MariaDB jdbc drivers updated.
* CXF upgraded. CXF now uses Netty for SOAP server connections instead of Jetty.

**Bug fixes**

* New admin roles could no longer be assigned/removed. Ref: GATEWAY-102.

### 1.4.0 (2016-04-18)

**New features**

* Script added for creating the required TLS certificate for database and IMAP
  replication in highly available setups.
* Script added for copying email to a second appliance.

**Technical changes**

* MTA config page refactored. The MTA page no longer has any advanced options
  since the old advanced options were important enough to show them at all
  times.
* The portal user password can be set to an empty value. This resets the
  password for the recipient. The next webmail message will then result in a new
  invite email.
* The X500 subject field now shows most settings by default and only shows the
  OU attribute under the 'more' option.
* Certificate/key import pages now return to the parent page (certificates,
  roots) after import. The import result is shown in the parent page.

**Bug fixes**

* Tooltip was not always shown on top.

**Miscellaneous**

* Most close/cancel buttons were removed to make the user interface more
  consistent. Users should use the back button or menu items for navigation.
* CSS naming on some forms changed for consistency.

### 1.3.5 (2016-03-15)

**New features**

* Support for MySQL/MariaDB and Oracle Database added. A Dovecot dict service
  has been added to support Oracle Database, since Dovecot does not support
  Oracle Database natively.
* Database and IMAP replication support added for highly available setups.
* ciphermail.backup.enabled system property added which can be used to disable
  the backup option in the web interface.

**Technical changes**

* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HTST) is now enabled by default.

**Bug fixes**

* Java wrapper upgraded to 3.5.28 to fix a memory leak on RedHat/CentOS.

### 1.3.4 (2015-11-27)

**New features**

* The user can now select their preferred language on the login page. The
  supported languages are English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese,
  Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese and Dutch.
* The web interface is now fully responsive on mobile devices.

**Technical changes**

* Roundcube updated.
* HTTPS enforcement in Roundcube is now enabled.

### 1.3.0 (2015-05-16)

**New features**

* Authorized recipients, for email sent by webmail users, can now be configured
  from the web interface.
* SMTP transports can now be configured from the web interface.
* Per-user quota support added.
* The maximum attachment size can now be configured from the web interface.
* Configurable periodic mail purging added.

**Technical changes**

* Virtual Appliance updated to 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
* Passwords are now processed as UTF-8 strings in order to support Unicode
  characters.
* Roundcube updated.
* Legacy browser plugin for Roundcube added to support old Internet Explorer
  versions.

**Bug fixes**

* Java wrapper updated to 3.5.26. This fixes a multibyte char logging bug which
  sometimes resulted in erroneous '?' characters in the log files.

### 1.2.1 (2014-04-10)

**New features**

* Mailbox manager added.
* rsyslog module added.
* Mail quota support added.

**Technical changes**

* HSM local mail encryption/decryption script refactored.
* Roundcube updated.

### 1.1.1 (2013-12-20)

* Initial release.

### Webmail Messenger

If a message must be protected, for example because it contains personal data, and S/MIME or PGP cannot be used, Webmail Messenger is a secure and easy-to-use alternative.

The recipient only needs a web browser. Webmail Messenger is a practical solution for communicating securely with external recipients who are unable to use S/MIME or PGP.
