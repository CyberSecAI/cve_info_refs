{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-uploaded .pdf files. Specifically, the application does not prevent the upload of malicious PDF files containing JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Lack of validation of uploaded file content"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. When an administrator interacts with the malicious .pdf, the JavaScript code executes within the administrator's browser session. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, or further compromise of the system.",
     "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user with the permission to upload files to the 'Assets' section of FUEL-CMS can upload a crafted PDF file containing malicious JavaScript code. When an administrator clicks on the uploaded malicious PDF file, the embedded JavaScript code executes in their browser.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permission to upload files in the 'Assets' section of the FUEL-CMS application. They also need to be able to create a malicious PDF file with embedded javascript."
