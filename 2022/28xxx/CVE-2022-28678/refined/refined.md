  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-28678",
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of Doc objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a use-after-free error. The application fails to validate the existence of a Doc object before performing operations on it.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free",
      "Insufficient Object Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
    "Attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack via malicious page or file",
      "User interaction required"
    ],
   "Required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or page that triggers the vulnerability. The target user needs to open this malicious file or visit the malicious page to be affected."
