- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `id` parameter in the `delete_amenity` function, which is then used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The attacker can also retrieve the database name and possibly gain full control over the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/reps/classes/Master.php?f=delete_amenity` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication seems to be required for this specific vulnerability. The attacker can be remote since the application is accessible via HTTP.
