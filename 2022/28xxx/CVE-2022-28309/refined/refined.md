Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read during the parsing of 3DS files within Bentley View. Maliciously crafted data within the 3DS file can cause the software to read beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:**  The primary weakness is the ability of the software to read memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer when processing a 3DS file. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the process's memory space.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The advisory from ZDI mentions that this vulnerability could be leveraged with others to execute arbitrary code within the current process context.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious 3DS File:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted 3DS file. The user must open this file using the vulnerable software.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Successful exploitation requires user interaction to open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted 3DS file.
*   The attacker also needs to deliver this malicious file to a target user of Bentley View and convince them to open it.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This vulnerability is associated with ZDI-CAN-16308 and is one of several vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-28308, CVE-2022-28312, CVE-2022-28313) related to 3DS file parsing in MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications.
*   Bentley has released updated versions of MicroStation and Bentley View to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) according to ZDI, indicating a low severity, local attack vector with user interaction required, and low confidentiality impact. However, the Bentley advisory gives a score of 3.3 with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a high impact for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2022-01-21 and publicly disclosed on 2022-04-12 by Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
