Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A malicious node acting as the leader in the consensus process can forge a block with an illegal block header. The consensus mechanism fails to verify the block header properly, leading to the acceptance of the invalid block.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Block Header Verification:** The consensus algorithm does not perform adequate validation of the block header proposed by the leader node. This allows a malicious leader to inject a forged block into the blockchain.
- **Lack of Forgery Detection:** The system does not detect the forgery when an invalid block header is submitted, leading to its inclusion into the chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Consensus of Illegal Blocks:** Maliciously crafted blocks are successfully added to the blockchain due to the lack of proper validation, causing inconsistency.
- **Transaction Failure:**  Transactions fail to process correctly due to the bad block being added to the chain.
- **Memory Exhaustion (OOM):** The accumulation of these invalid blocks, which can't be executed, can lead to memory leaks and ultimately out-of-memory errors due to unreleased resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Leader Node:** A compromised or malicious node that becomes the leader in the consensus process initiates the attack by proposing a block with a forged header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromised Node:** The attacker needs control of a node within the FISCO BCOS network.
- **Leader Election:** The malicious node must be elected as the leader in the consensus mechanism to propose the forged block.
- **Understanding of the Protocol:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of the consensus protocol to forge a block header.
