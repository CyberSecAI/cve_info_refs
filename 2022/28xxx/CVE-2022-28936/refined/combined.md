| **Describe the bug** I setup a group of 10 nodes under 3.0.0-rc2 version. One of the nodes is a malicious one and tries to modify some fields when it sends out some packages. Then I use the following command to test the system:  ``` java -cp 'conf/:lib/*:apps/*' org.fisco.bcos.sdk.demo.perf.PerformanceOk 500000 5000 group  ```  Then some transactions cannot be processed successfully. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. setup a 10 nodes group 2. start the press test program 3. See the error   **Expected behavior** All the transactions should be processed correctly.  **Screenshots** The information of the log: [wecom-temp-91f562961c3181bcc3b08c065911ac20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22519865/160398901-16eaee6a-2adc-4f9a-8745-3a51c8cba995.png)  **Environment (please complete the following information):**   * OS: Ubuntu 20.04 * FISCO BCOS Version 3.0.0-rc2 |

| It can be seen from the log that the `loki` node forged a block with an illegal block header, and the consensus node did not verify the block, resulting in the successful consensusing of the illegal blocks, but when the block was executed, the execution failed all the time.  This problem further leads to the accumulation of blocks, the memory cannot be released, which leads to oom. |

Sorry, something went wrong.
