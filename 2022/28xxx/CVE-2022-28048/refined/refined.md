Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28048:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer shift of invalid size within the `stbi__jpeg_decode_block_prog_ac()` function of the stb library, specifically when decoding progressive JPEG images. The issue arises because the code_bits value can become negative, leading to a left shift by a value greater than or equal to the bit-width of the integer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer shift with negative shift amount:** The core vulnerability is an attempt to perform a left bit shift with a negative shift count. This operation is undefined behavior in C/C++, and leads to a crash in this case.
- **Insufficient bounds checking:** Lack of proper validation of `code_bits` before using it in a bit-shift operation.
- **Improper error handling:** The code attempts to read bits, and when it fails, it doesn't return or terminate immediately. Instead, it leaves the `code_bits` at a value that leads to the crash later.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious JPEG image that triggers the vulnerable code, causing a crash. This can lead to a denial of service for any application using the vulnerable version of the stb library to process user-provided images.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious image file:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted JPEG image file to an application that uses the stb library.
- **Progressive JPEG:** The vulnerability specifically affects the processing of progressive JPEG images, which are a type of JPEG image where the image data is encoded to display a low-quality image quickly, and is improved progressively.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to an application or service that uses the vulnerable stb library to parse JPEG images.
- **Crafting a specific image:**  The attacker needs the ability to craft an image that would trigger the problematic code path. This seems feasible with some understanding of the JPEG file format and the stb implementation, as evident from the OSS-fuzz findings.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability is located in `stbi__jpeg_decode_block_prog_ac()`.
- The specific issue involves a left bit shift operation `b << (24 - j->code_bits)` within the `stbi__grow_buffer_unsafe` function.
- This occurs when `j->code_bits` becomes negative, leading to a shift of 32 or more bits.
- The issue is triggered by specific crafted JPEG files which can cause `stbi__grow_buffer_unsafe()` to return a `j->code_bits` of zero, which is then decremented to negative values before the problematic shift operation is reached.
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure `j->code_bits` is not negative before the shift operation.
- The patch also appears to have addressed issues where `stbi__jpeg` structs could be reused without proper zero-initialization between multiple image loads, leading to out-of-bounds reads in `stbi__jpeg_huff_decode`, which is also related to improper code_bits handling.
- The fix has been incorporated into the development branch of the stb library and released in version 2.28.
- Patches have also been backported to Fedora 34, 35, and 36.
