Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-28160:

**CVE-2022-28160**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Tests Selector Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.3.3 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin allows users to specify a file path as part of its configuration, but does not properly sanitize this input.
*   **Weakness:** Arbitrary file read vulnerability. The plugin uses a user-controlled file path to access file system, without proper checks.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller's file system.
*   **Attack Vector:** By specifying a malicious file path in the "Choosing Tests" parameter of the plugin.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission in Jenkins.

**Summary:**
The Tests Selector Plugin allows users with Item/Configure permissions to specify a file path using the "Choosing Tests" parameter. Due to the plugin's failure to properly sanitize user input, an attacker can provide a path to an arbitrary file on the Jenkins controller's file system, leading to an arbitrary file read vulnerability.
