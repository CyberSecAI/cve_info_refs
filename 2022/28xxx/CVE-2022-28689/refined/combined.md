##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-28689

##### SUMMARY

A leftover debug code vulnerability exists in the console support functionality of InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.45. A specially-crafted network request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

InHand Networks InRouter302 V3.5.45

##### PRODUCT URLS

InRouter302 - <https://www.inhandnetworks.com/products/inrouter300.html>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

6.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-489 - Leftover Debug Code

##### DETAILS

The InRouter302 is an industrial LTE router. It features remote management functionalities and several security protection mechanisms, such as: VPN technologies, firewall functionalities, authorization management and several other features.

The InRouter302 offers telnet and sshd services. Both, when provided with the correct credentials, will allow access to the Router console.

Here is the prompt after the login:

```

Router>

```

The Router console contains a command, called `support`, that is not listed among the available functionalities. This is probably a leftover debug code.
This command allows to enable or disable the `inhand` command, leading to enable advisory TALOS-2022-1477 again.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

The command allows to enable the `inhand` command in the router console, specifying enable as argument:

```
Router> inhand
Router> support
0*wsuppP�)w
================================================
Arguments:
enable
disable
Router> support enable
Router> inhand
input password:

```
