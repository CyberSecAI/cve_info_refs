Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `delete_supplier` function within the `Master.php` file of the "Purchase-order-management-system v1.0" application.
- The application is vulnerable because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `id` parameter in the URL. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization on the `id` parameter, allowing SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: The provided exploit uses `updatexml()` to extract the database name, indicating an information disclosure vulnerability. This suggests that other sensitive data could also be retrieved through similar SQL injection techniques, including data modification, or deletion.
- Potential complete compromise: Depending on database permissions and the nature of the application, an attacker may also gain the ability to modify or delete data, or even potentially gain command execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attack is carried out using an HTTP POST request to `purchase_order/classes/Master.php?f=delete_supplier`.
- URL Parameter: The malicious SQL payload is injected via the `id` URL parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a prerequisite for exploitation in the provided content. It can be assumed that the `delete_supplier` function may be accessible without prior authentication, or the attacker has already authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit uses `updatexml()` function, which is specific to MySQL, to demonstrate the SQL injection. The successful exploitation indicates that the backend database is most likely MySQL.
- The provided payload can leak the database name, but it also indicates that other information can be potentially leaked as well, by modifying the `SELECT` statement within the payload.
