- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Brocade SANnav REST API logs authentication tokens in plain text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Plaintext storage of sensitive authentication tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the logs could obtain valid authentication tokens, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the SANnav system. This would allow the attacker to perform actions as a legitimate user, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the logs where the authentication tokens are stored in plain text.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the server logs of Brocade SANnav. The attacker would likely require local access, as indicated by the CVSS vector.
