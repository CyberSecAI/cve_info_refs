Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `student-grading-system` application. Specifically, the application is vulnerable due to unsanitized user input passed through the `id` parameter in the URL: `/student-grading-system/rms.php?page=student_p&id=`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the `id` parameter from the URL into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive database information. The provided example payload demonstrates this by retrieving the database name using `database()`.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** With more sophisticated SQL injection techniques, an attacker could potentially modify, add, or delete data in the database.
- **Full Database Takeover:** In severe cases, a full database takeover could be possible, giving the attacker complete control over the application's data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL. The `id` parameter in the query string is used to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques to craft a working payload.

**Payload:**
The provided payload is:
```
id=1%27%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,database(),11,12,13,14,15,16,CONCAT(0x716a767a71,0x4363574d72716c57514d6f6e626241676a5469757266544a466d704755435841746863464d445244,0x716a787a71),18,19--+-
```
This payload leverages a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to append the output of the crafted query to the original SQL query. This specific payload attempts to retrieve the database name using the `database()` function, and also uses `CONCAT` to insert a string for identification.
