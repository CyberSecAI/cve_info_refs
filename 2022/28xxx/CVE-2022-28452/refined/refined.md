{
  "CVE-2022-28452": {
    "description": "The `username` parameter in Red Planet Laundry Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. By injecting a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's `load_file` function with a UNC file path, an attacker can force the application to interact with an external domain, indicating successful SQL query execution.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `username` parameter, before using it in a SQL query, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially take control of administrator accounts, all accounts on the system, and download all information about the system, leading to complete compromise of the application and data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the login functionality, accessible via a POST request to the `/index.php/login/rediract` endpoint, using the `username` parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and inject malicious SQL statements into the `username` parameter."
