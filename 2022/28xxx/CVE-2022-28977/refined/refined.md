Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `HtmlUtil.escapeRedirect` function within Liferay Portal. This function is intended to sanitize redirect URLs to prevent malicious redirects. However, it can be circumvented by using multiple forward slashes (`//`) in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `HtmlUtil.escapeRedirect` function fails to properly handle or normalize URLs containing multiple forward slashes, leading to bypass.
*   **Open Redirect:** The vulnerability results in an open redirect, where an attacker can control the destination URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Arbitrary URLs:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to:
    *   Phishing attacks: Stealing user credentials by redirecting to fake login pages.
    *   Malware distribution: Infecting users with malware by redirecting to malicious download sites.
    *   Social Engineering: Manipulating users into performing actions they wouldn't normally do.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`redirect` Parameter:** The `redirect` parameter in Liferay Portal is vulnerable to this issue.
*   **`FORWARD_URL` Parameter:** The `FORWARD_URL` parameter is also vulnerable.
*   **Other Parameters:** Any other parameters that rely on `HtmlUtil.escapeRedirect` are also vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through HTTP requests.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must click on the crafted link containing the malicious redirect URL.

**Additional Information:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating a medium severity.
*   **Affected Versions:**
