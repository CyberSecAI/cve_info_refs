{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly includes an incoming file without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted file inclusion vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by including a file containing malicious code, leading to a webshell and potential full server compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to the `index.php?m=home&c=home&a=sp_set_config` endpoint with a `file` parameter pointing to the malicious file and a `config_array` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and have a file on the server that they can include using the vulnerable parameter."
