Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the login page of the Hotel Management System. This occurs because user-supplied input (specifically the username) is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the username field on the login page.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Parameterization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-provided input before incorporating it into SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify database data (insert, update, delete).
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers may be able to bypass authentication and gain access to the system using crafted SQL injection payloads.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, attackers might be able to execute administrative operations on the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the login page of the web application (`login.php` and `ajax.php`).
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code using special characters (e.g., single quotes, semi-colons, SQL commands) into the username field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the web application (as the vulnerable URL is given as `http://127.0.0.1`).
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker should have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective SQL injection payloads.
*  **Tooling**: The attacker could use tools like SQLMap to automate the exploitation process

**Additional Details**

*   The article provides a specific payload example `â€˜; --`  that triggers an SQL error when entered into the username field.
*   The exploit process is demonstrated using SQLmap, showcasing how to leverage this tool to identify the injection point and exploit it using various techniques.
*   The vulnerable URL provided is `/ajax.php`, which is likely where the login form data is processed.
*   The provided example of vulnerable code and description of impacts align with a typical SQL Injection vulnerability as also described by OWASP

**Summary:**
The provided content confirms the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-28110) in the Hotel Management System's login functionality. It details the root cause (lack of proper input handling), the impact (data exposure, manipulation, and authentication bypass), attack vectors (username field on the login page), required attacker capabilities, and provides concrete examples with payloads, sqlmap usage, and vulnerable code. This is consistent with a standard SQL injection scenario.
