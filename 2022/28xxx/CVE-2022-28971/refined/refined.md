- Root cause of vulnerability: A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSetIpMacBind` function within the `tdhttpd` binary. This function is accessible via the URL `goform/SetIpMacBind`.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The function takes a POST argument named `list`, and copies its value directly to a local stack variable without proper length validation.
- Impact of exploitation: A successful exploit leads to a stack overflow, which can cause a denial of service (DoS).
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetIpMacBind` URL, with the `list` parameter containing an oversized string.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device. The provided PoC suggests the attacker can be on the same network as the device.
