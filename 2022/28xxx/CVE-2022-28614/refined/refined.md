{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ap_rwrite()` function in Apache HTTP Server may read unintended memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause the server to read unintended memory, potentially leading to information disclosure or a crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite() or ap_rputs(), such as with mod_lua's r:puts() function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests that trigger the use of ap_rwrite() or ap_rputs() with large input. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
