Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization on the `sid` parameter within the `siteoptions.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `sid` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database including database names and potentially other user information.
- **Data Manipulation:** Beyond data retrieval, a successful attack could allow modification of existing data or deletion of data.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to bypass authentication or gain higher privileges within the system.
- **Denial of Service:** By injecting certain malicious queries, an attacker could potentially cause the database to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to the `admin.php` file, specifically targeting the `sid` parameter.
- Attackers can inject SQL code within the `sid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable endpoint `admin.php` and parameter `sid`.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests with malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Technical details:**
- The provided content includes a sample payload for extracting the database name using `updatexml` function and also showcases blind SQL injection techniques using `RLIKE`, `EXTRACTVALUE` and `SLEEP` based payloads.

- Vulnerable URL: `/BabyCare/admin.php?id=siteoptions&social=display&value=0&sid=2`
- Injection Point: `sid` parameter.
- Sample payload: `/BabyCare/admin.php?id=siteoptions&social=display&value=0&sid=2%27%20and%20updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20database()),0x7e),2)--+`
- Blind SQL injection payloads also demonstrated.
