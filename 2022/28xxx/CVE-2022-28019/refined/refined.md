The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Attendance and Payroll System v1.0, specifically in the `admin/employee_edit.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically the `id` parameter in `employee_edit.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `id` parameter of the `employee_edit.php` page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries allowing them to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete existing data.
    - Potentially gain further access to the underlying system.
In this example the attacker is able to extract the name of the current database.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/apsystem/admin/employee_edit.php`, specifically injecting malicious SQL into the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication appears to be required for the specific vulnerable endpoint as long as a valid PHPSESSID cookie is sent.
The attacker must also be able to access the `employee_edit.php` endpoint.
