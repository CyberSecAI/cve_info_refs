    "RELATED": true,
    "DETAILS": [
      {
        "ROOT CAUSE": "The application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects. This occurs due to the use of a wild pointer or null pointer without proper validation.",
        "WEAKNESSES": [
          "Use-After-Free vulnerability",
          "Lack of proper validation of pointers"
        ],
        "IMPACT": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute remote code.",
        "ATTACK VECTORS": [
          "Opening a specially crafted PDF file.",
	        "Malicious javascript execution."
        ],
        "ATTACKER CAPABILITIES": "Attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or control the content of a PDF file to include malicious javascript. No special capabilities are needed."
      },
      {
        "ROOT CAUSE": "By performing actions in JavaScript, an attacker can trigger a read past the end of an allocated object.",
         "WEAKNESSES": [

           "Lack of proper validation on object size"
          ],
         "IMPACT": "Attackers could disclose sensitive information. The vulnerability can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.",
        "ATTACK VECTORS": [
          "User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
          "Execution of a crafted JavaScript in PDF."
        ],
         "ATTACKER CAPABILITIES": "An attacker can trigger a read past the end of an allocated object by performing actions in JavaScript. An attacker would need to craft a PDF with malicious javascript, or compromise an existing document to include it."
