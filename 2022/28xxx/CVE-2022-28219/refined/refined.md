**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information (from `github.com_05473e85_20250115_185026.html` and `www.horizon3.ai_a28694d4_20250115_185008.html` and `www.horizon3.ai_ab526ad0_20250115_185003.html`):**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from multiple flaws: unsafe Java object deserialization, path traversal vulnerability in the Cewolf charting library, and a blind XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in the `ProcessTrackingListener` class.
    *   The application performs unsafe deserialization of user-supplied data without proper validation, which leads to arbitrary code execution.
    *   The lack of proper sanitization of file paths in the `CewolfRenderer` servlet allows path traversal.
    *   The usage of a vulnerable `DocumentBuilderFactory` in the `ProcessTrackingListener` class allows for XXE injection.
    *   The older Java runtime versions (8u121 or below) that ship with ADAudit are more susceptible to exploitation.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unsafe Java Deserialization:** The application performs unsafe deserialization of user-supplied data, enabling arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Path Traversal:** The `img` parameter in the `/cewolf` endpoint allows path traversal, enabling attackers to specify arbitrary file paths for deserialization.
    *   **Blind XXE Injection:**  The `ProcessTrackingListener` class is vulnerable to XXE injection through the processing of Windows scheduled task XML content. This allows for data exfiltration and even file uploads.
    *   **Lack of Authentication:** Multiple endpoints lack authentication, enabling an attacker to exploit the above vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the target system with SYSTEM privileges by combining the deserialization and path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Domain Compromise:** Attackers can leverage the XXE vulnerability to exfiltrate domain credentials or use NTLM relay attacks for further compromise.
    *    **Data Exfiltration:** The XXE vulnerability allows attackers to retrieve directory listings and files from the vulnerable server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Requests:** Malicious HTTP requests to the `/cewolf` endpoint trigger the deserialization vulnerability.
    *   **JSON payloads:** JSON payloads to the `/api/agent/tabs/agentData` endpoint trigger the XXE vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the ADAudit Plus server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Domain Name:** For the XXE attack, the attacker needs to know the fully qualified Windows domain served by ADAudit Plus.
    *    **Old Java Runtime**: RCE is more easily achieved if the ADAudit Plus instance is using a Java runtime version equal to or lower than 8u121.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The content highlights that the vulnerability was discovered by Horizon3.ai and reported to ManageEngine, who released a patch in build 7060 of ADAudit Plus.
*  The content from `www.horizon3.ai_ab526ad0_20250115_185003.html` provides instructions on how to exploit the vulnerability, including:
    * Generating a malicious java payload using `ysoserial`.
    * Using the BlockingServer to upload the malicious payload to the server via the XXE.
    * Using a XXE FTP server to discover the location of the uploaded payload.
    * Using the Cewolf endpoint with path traversal to execute the uploaded payload.
* The content mentions that a proof of concept exploit code is publicly available for the vulnerability.
* Mitigation steps from vendor include upgrading to a newer version of ADAudit Plus (build 7060 or later) and setting up a dedicated service account with restricted access.
*   The content notes that a self-contained proof-of-concept (PoC) script is available on GitHub.
*   The source code from `www.horizon3.ai_a28694d4_20250115_185008.html` (which is an image) shows the process of exploiting the vulnerability.
