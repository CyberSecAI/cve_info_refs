{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's login API did not properly handle requests for invalid usernames, leading to different responses based on whether a user exists or not.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "User enumeration vulnerability due to inconsistent responses in login API."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could identify valid users in the organization's Active Directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to the `/ServletAPI/accounts/login` endpoint with different `loginName` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's login API."
