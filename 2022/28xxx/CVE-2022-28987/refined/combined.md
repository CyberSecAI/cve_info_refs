# CVE-2022-28987 â User enumeration vulnerability

| Vulnerability Details | |
| --- | --- |
| Severity | Low |
| CVE ID | CVE-2022-28987 |
| Affected software versions | Builds 6201 and below |
| Fixed version | Build 6202 |
| Fixed on | June 27, 2022 |

### Details

CVE-2022-28987 refers to a security vulnerability reported in ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus that allowed an attacker to identify existing valid users in the domain through user enumeration using product login API.

We have now released ADSelfService Plus build 6202 that fixes the issue as follows:

* A setting to prevent user enumeration has now been provided under the Login Settings module. When this setting is enabled, a mock MFA process is initiated thus preventing the attacker from identifying valid users.

### Impact

This issue allowed the attacker to identify valid users in the organization.

### Steps to upgrade

Update your ADSelfService Plus instance to 6202 using the [service pack](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/service-pack.html).

### Acknowledgements

This issue was reported by Metin Yunus Kandemir through the Zoho BugBounty program.
