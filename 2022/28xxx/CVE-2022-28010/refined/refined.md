The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Attendance and Payroll System v1.0. This aligns with the general nature of CVE-2022-28010, which is a placeholder for retrieving CVE descriptions, so it is likely this will be relevant when a proper CVE description is present

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `id` parameter in `admin\overtime_delete.php`, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the application directly includes the unsanitized `id` parameter in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this example, the attacker uses `updatexml` to extract database information, suggesting a potential for information disclosure. The attacker can also use this vulnerability to bypass authentication mechanisms, modify data, or even potentially gain control over the underlying system.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is HTTP POST request to `admin\overtime_delete.php`, specifically targeting the `id` parameter.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system. The provided example shows that no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, as the attacker is using session cookies already. The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint, parameters, and some basic SQL syntax. The attacker is able to trigger the vulnerability by sending an HTTP POST request to `/apsystem/admin/overtime_delete.php` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.

**Additional notes:**
*   The provided information is more detailed than what a typical CVE description provides.
*   The provided payload uses `updatexml` to extract data, this can also be used to extract the entire database if needed.
*   The code example shows a POST request, including the necessary headers, providing a clear and actionable example of how to exploit this vulnerability.
