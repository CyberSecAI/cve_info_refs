- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A critical out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Adobe InDesign.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requires user interaction (opening a malicious file), and does not require special privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to convince a user to open a specially crafted file using a vulnerable version of Adobe InDesign.
