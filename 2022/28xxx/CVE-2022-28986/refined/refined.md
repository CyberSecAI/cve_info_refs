  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure direct object references (IDOR) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Simple 2FA Plugin for Moodle does not properly validate user IDs, allowing an attacker to manipulate the 'u' parameter in the /auth/simple2fa/profile.php request. This parameter contains base64 encoded JSON data representing user information, which can be tampered with to modify other users accounts."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can update sensitive records of other user accounts, including email, password, and phone number.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker logs in using a self-registered account.",
      "Instead of providing the 2FA code, the attacker force browses to `/auth/simple2fa/profile.php`.",
      "The attacker captures the request, decodes the base64 encoded JSON data, modifies it to change the target user's details (including the password), and encodes it again.",
      "The attacker sends the tampered data to the server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid user account in the system, and be able to intercept HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite) to manipulate the request parameters."
