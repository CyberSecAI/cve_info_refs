Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28346:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions `CVE-2022-28346: Potential SQL injection in QuerySet.annotate(), aggregate(), and extra()` which aligns with the specified CVE. The descriptions of the vulnerability also match the official description that these methods were subject to SQL injection in column aliases, using a suitably crafted dictionary. Therefore the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of column aliases within the `QuerySet.annotate()`, `aggregate()`, and `extra()` methods in Django. These methods, when used with dictionary expansion (using `**kwargs`), failed to properly validate the keys, allowing a specially crafted dictionary to inject arbitrary SQL code into the column alias.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization in column alias parameters.
    *   Vulnerability in methods used for constructing SQL queries from user-provided dictionaries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Disclosure of sensitive information:** An attacker could potentially extract data from the database by crafting a malicious query using injected SQL.
    *   **Addition or modification of data:** Malicious SQL could be injected to alter database records.
    *  **Denial of Service (DoS):** It is implied that specially crafted SQL queries could also be used to cause a denial of service by causing database errors, making it unable to execute further queries or overloading it.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through the `**kwargs` parameter of `QuerySet.annotate()`, `aggregate()`, and `extra()`.
    *   By providing a dictionary with malicious keys, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code within a column alias.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input to the `**kwargs` parameter in methods such as `QuerySet.annotate()`, `aggregate()`, or `extra()`.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N)

**3. Additional Technical Details and Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically related to the way Django handles column aliases when these methods receive dictionary inputs using `**kwargs`
*   The vulnerability affects Django versions 2.2 prior to 2.2.28, 3.2 prior to 3.2.13, and 4.0 prior to 4.0.4. The fix involves properly sanitizing the column alias to avoid SQL injection.
*   The severity of this vulnerability is considered "high" by the Django project.
*   NetApp indicates that successful exploitation could also lead to DoS attacks, which the official CVE description doesn't explicitly mention.
*   The patch involves adding a check for forbidden characters in column aliases to prevent SQL injection in the `add_annotation` and `add_extra` functions.
*   The advisory also credits the Splunk team and a security researcher (Danylo Dmytriiev) for the report.
*  Multiple sources also indicate that the vulnerability can be exploited by using a dictionary to define column aliases passed via `**kwargs`, which allows for SQL injection. This is more specific than the generic CVE description and identifies the exact attack vector.
*  NetApp also confirms that NetApp products that use Django are vulnerable to the SQL injection issue

**4. Summary of Relevant Content:**

The analyzed content consistently highlights a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-28346) affecting Django versions 2.2, 3.2 and 4.0 when using `QuerySet.annotate()`, `aggregate()`, and `extra()` methods with unsanitized column aliases provided through dictionary expansion with `**kwargs`. This could result in sensitive information disclosure, data modification or denial of service, depending on the injected SQL code. The vulnerability is resolved by sanitizing the alias inputs.
