Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-28734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the way GRUB2 handles split HTTP headers. Specifically, the HTTP code within GRUB2 has an issue where it accidentally moves its internal data buffer pointer by one position when processing these split headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The accidental shift of the data buffer pointer leads to an out-of-bounds write during the parsing of the HTTP request. This results in writing a NULL byte beyond the intended buffer boundary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** An attacker can potentially manipulate the HTTP packets to trigger this vulnerability leading to memory corruption of GRUB2's internal metadata. While not explicitly stated, memory corruption could lead to arbitrary code execution, bypassing of Secure Boot, or Denial of Service.
- The severity is rated as a "7" on the CVSS v3.1 scale, indicating a High severity with impact on Confidentiality (Low), Integrity (Low), and Availability (High).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted HTTP packets. The attacker must be able to interact with GRUB2 via network, e.g. during network boot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network access:** An attacker needs to be positioned to send HTTP requests that will be processed by the vulnerable GRUB2 instance.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Daniel Axtens.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in a patch set for various security flaws in GRUB2.
- The advisory also mentions that an attacker controlled set of packets can potentially lead to memory corruption in GRUB2's internal memory metadata.
- The NetApp advisory lists the specific NetApp product affected, Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere, and provides links to download updated versions.
