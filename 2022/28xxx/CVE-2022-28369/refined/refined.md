Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28369:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Verizon 5G LVSKIHP IDU (InDoor Unit) firmware version 3.4.66.162 does not properly validate the URI passed to the `enable_ssh` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of URI validation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper input validation for the URI provided to the `enable_ssh` function. This allows an attacker to specify a malicious URI.
- **Arbitrary File Upload/Execution:** Due to the lack of validation, the system attempts to process and use the provided URI as part of the ssh enable process. This may involve downloading, writing to a file, or executing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file upload:** An attacker can upload any file to the device via a crafted URI.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By uploading a malicious executable, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted URI to the `enable_ssh` function of the IDU component of the Verizon 5G LVSKIHP modem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable IDU component of the modem.
- While not explicitly stated, it's implied that the attacker would need to have a network connection to the device.
- It is likely that authentication bypass is required to reach the vulnerable function since it is not a user-facing function. This can be achieved through exploitation of CVE-2022-28376 and using the static engineering password.
