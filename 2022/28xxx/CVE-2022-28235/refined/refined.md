- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-After-Free (UAF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF), where a memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to potential corruption of memory or arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring a user to open a specially crafted malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious file that triggers the UAF vulnerability. The attacker needs to convince the user to open this file locally on the target machine.
