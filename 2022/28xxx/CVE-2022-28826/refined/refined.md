- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to out-of-bounds write, which is a type of memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning an attacker needs local access to the system. User interaction is required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N), but needs to trick a user into opening a malicious file.
