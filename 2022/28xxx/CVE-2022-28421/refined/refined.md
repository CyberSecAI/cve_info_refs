The provided content is related to CVE-2022-28421.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `postid` parameter in the `/BabyCare/admin.php` file, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `postid` parameter.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data, potentially compromising the application and sensitive information.
- The provided example payload demonstrates how to extract the database name, which could be a first step in data exfiltration or further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted GET request to `/BabyCare/admin.php` by manipulating the `postid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement, suggesting that the vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
