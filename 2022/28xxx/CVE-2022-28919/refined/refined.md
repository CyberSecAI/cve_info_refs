  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-28919",
    "description": "The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the `HTMLCreator` component of the `php-openpsa-universalfeedcreator` library. Specifically, the `_generateFilename` function is vulnerable. This function is used when generating filenames for feed content. The issue stems from the usage of PHP's `pathinfo()` function which can be bypassed to inject malicious code into the filename, leading to an XSS vulnerability.",
    "affected_component": "php-openpsa-universalfeedcreator",
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of filename when creating feeds. The `_generateFilename` function in `HTMLCreator.php` uses PHP's `pathinfo` function, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks if user-supplied input is passed to it. The `basename` returned by `pathinfo` is not properly sanitized before being used in a context that could execute Javascript.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the filename that, when rendered, would execute within the user's browser. This can allow the attacker to perform actions as the victim, such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing other unauthorized actions within the application's context.",
     "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the filename that will be used by the `_generateFilename` function, likely through user controlled parameters for feed generation. No privileges are needed.",
     "user_interaction": "User interaction is required, as the user needs to load the page where the malicious filename is displayed.",
