The provided content is related to CVE-2022-28448.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize customer names before displaying them in a notification message on the login page after a user attempts to access a restricted resource.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: User-controlled input (customer's first and last name) is stored in the database without proper sanitization. This data is later reflected in the login page's notification message without proper HTML encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser.
- If an admin is impersonating a customer with malicious JavaScript in their name, this script could execute under the admin's session, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into the First name or Last name fields of a customer's profile.
- The application uses this unsanitized name to construct the notification message upon redirection to the login page after accessing a denied resource, resulting in execution of injected code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify a customer profile, specifically the first name or last name fields.
