Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-28138:

**CVE-2022-28138:**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** RocketChat Notifier Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.4.10 and earlier
*  **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation. Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks when validating forms.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The absence of POST request requirement allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attackers can induce a user's browser to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request or induce a victim to send it.

**Summary**
The RocketChat Notifier Plugin versions 1.4.10 and earlier are vulnerable to CSRF and missing permission check vulnerabilities. An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can exploit these vulnerabilities to connect to an arbitrary URL with attacker-controlled credentials due to missing permission check, which is further aggravated by the CSRF vulnerability that allows arbitrary HTTP request to be sent.
