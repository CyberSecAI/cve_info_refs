- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the `SafeBinaryFormatter` library, leading to deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution in the context of the service account.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, exploiting the vulnerable `SafeBinaryFormatter` library by providing malicious user-supplied data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires authentication to exploit.
