- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software attempts to read data beyond the boundaries of a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the user open a malicious file. The user must be tricked into opening a crafted file.
