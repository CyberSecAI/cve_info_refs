| SQL injection vulnerability exists in JFinal CMS 5.1.0Analysis The vulnerability appears in lines 23-47 of the **com.jflyfox.system.log.LogController.java** [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100123029/160562065-b3a28e66-c146-49b3-a3a6-4592d81257ab.png)  Here call **SQLUtils** to query with the following statement:  ``` select count(*)  from sys_log t where 1=1  ```  When the length of **model.getAttrValues()** is not equal to 0, go into the if branch and call the **whereEquals()** method to concatenate **whereEquals()**： [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100123029/160562245-981857f7-a042-4d53-8af1-22e6833a32f7.png)  The SQL statement after concatenation is as follows:  ``` select count(*)  from sys_log t where 1=1 AND t.log_type = 1   ```  Moving on, the **orderBy** parameter is concatenated to the end of the SQL statement **String orderBy = getBaseForm().getorDerby ();** defines the source of the **orderBy** argument getBaseForm(): [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100123029/160562623-922625a9-976c-40af-87ff-f0a8b6db96f9.png) getOrderBy()： [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100123029/160562649-b42621cd-a75e-42d6-aafd-363a2d56c566.png)  The **orderBy** parameter is the **form.OrderColumn** parameter passed from the front end So you can construct payload to exploit this vulnerability Exploit Maven Startup Environment Vulnerability address: /jfinal\_cms/system/log/list Administrator login is required.
