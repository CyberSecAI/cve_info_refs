The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Attendance and Payroll System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `id` parameter in `admin/schedule_edit.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the `id` parameter within the `schedule_employee_edit.php` file. The vulnerable code directly incorporates user-provided data into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- Data Modification: An attacker could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss of integrity.
- Database Manipulation: The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially altering the structure of the database, or gain full access to the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `admin/schedule_employee_edit.php`.
- The `id` parameter: The vulnerable parameter is `id` which is passed through the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the application: The attacker needs network access to the application.
- Understanding of SQL Injection: The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
