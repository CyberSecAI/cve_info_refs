**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper initialization of memory before it's accessed during the parsing of 3DM files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uninitialized variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user opening a maliciously crafted 3DM file. This can be achieved through a malicious page or by directly opening the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious 3DM file and lure the user into opening it with a vulnerable version of Bentley MicroStation CONNECT. No special privileges are needed.
