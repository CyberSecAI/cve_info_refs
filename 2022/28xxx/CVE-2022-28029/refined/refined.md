The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Simple Real Estate Portal System v1.0".

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server. This could lead to data exfiltration, data modification, or complete compromise of the application and its underlying infrastructure.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is located in the `/reps/classes/Master.php` file, specifically when handling the `delete_type` function via a POST request. The `id` parameter is the injection point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, typically via a web browser or other HTTP client.

The content also provides example payloads for exploiting the vulnerability, including error-based, boolean-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
