Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28153:

**CVE-2022-28153**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The SiteMonitor Plugin does not properly escape URLs of sites to be monitored within tooltips.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied URLs when displaying them in tooltips.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the tooltips, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the configured job, allowing for arbitrary actions within the victim's browser session. This includes data theft or other malicious activity.
*  **Attack Vectors**:  An attacker with `Item/Configure` permission can configure the SiteMonitor plugin with a malicious URL. When other users view job pages where this plugin is used, the malicious script embedded in the tooltips is executed within their browsers.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker needs `Item/Configure` permission to modify job configurations and input a malicious URL.

**Summary:**

The SiteMonitor plugin fails to sanitize URLs used in tooltips. This allows an attacker with `Item/Configure` permission to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the browsers of other users when they interact with the job configuration. This is a stored XSS vulnerability that could lead to significant security issues, including unauthorized actions, data theft and account compromise.
