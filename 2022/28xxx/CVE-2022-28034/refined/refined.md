The provided content is related to CVE-2022-28034.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin/ajax/list-sort.php` file. Specifically, the `list` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
- This can lead to data breaches where the attacker can read sensitive information from the database.
- The attacker can modify or delete data, including tables and databases, if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/admin/ajax/list-sort.php` with a malicious SQL payload within the `list` parameter.
- Specifically, the exploit uses `list[1]=(sleep(5))` to verify the vulnerability through a time-based SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/ajax/list-sort.php`).
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as evidenced by the public nature of the issue.
