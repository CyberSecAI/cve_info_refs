  "CVE-2022-28893": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2022-28893",
      "Description": "The SUNRPC subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.17.2 can call xs_xprt_free before ensuring that sockets are in the intended state. Details: Use after free happens in inet_put_port because some sockets are not close before xs_xprt_free()."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SUNRPC subsystem in the Linux kernel calls `xs_xprt_free` before ensuring all sockets are closed, leading to a use-after-free.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service or an information leak.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability occurs in the SUNRPC subsystem of the Linux kernel.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability. Users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities might be able to trigger the issue."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
       "Fix Information": "The fix is included in the commit f00432063db1a0db484e85193eccc6845435b80e in the Linux kernel repository, and also merged through 1a3b1bba7c7a5eb8a11513cf88427cb9d77bc60a. The commit ensures that any closed sockets are flushed before xs_xprt_free() is called.",
       "NetApp Products": "Multiple NetApp products are affected, including: NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H300E/H500E/H700E/H410S, NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C, NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS), NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node, NetApp SolidFire, Enterprise SDS & HCI Storage Node (Element Software).",
       "Affected versions": "Linux Kernel versions through 5.17.2 are susceptible to this vulnerability."
