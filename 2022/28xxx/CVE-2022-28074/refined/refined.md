{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input when saving or exporting data, allowing injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
    "Insecure data export of backup files",
	"Unencrypted JSON data"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks when the injected script is executed.",
  "Attack vectors": [
     "Injecting malicious scripts via the textarea label in the system settings page: halo-1.5.0\\admin\\index.html#/system/options",
    "Modifying the blog_footer_info value in the JSON export to include malicious code which can be executed when the data is imported",
	"Modifying exported, unencrypted backup files to include malicious code which can be executed when the data is imported"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access the system settings page or export/import backup data."
