  "CVE-2022-28806": {
    "match": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the allocated buffer pointer (CommBuffer) in a System Management Mode (SMM) Software System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of allocated buffer pointer",
	  "SMM memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to corrupt data in System Management RAM (SMRAM), leading to arbitrary code execution within SMM. This results in a privilege escalation from ring 0 to ring -2, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the vulnerable SWSMI handler in SMM",
	  "Triggering the SWSMI handler with a crafted CommBuffer"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to execute code in ring 0 to trigger the vulnerable SWSMI handler in SMM with a crafted CommBuffer. This could be achieved through local access or remote access in combination with administrative privileges.",
     "vulnerable_code": "The vulnerability affects the driver `FjGabiFlashCoreAbstractionSmm`."
