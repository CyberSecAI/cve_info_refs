## Advisory Description

### [INSYDE-SA-2022/Q1:](https://www.insyde.com/security-pledge) 2022/Q1 ISA – Insyde® Firmware (InsydeH2O UEFI-BIOS) Advisory

Multiple potential security vulnerabilities in the Insyde® InsydeH2O Hardware-2-Operating System (H2O) UEFI firmware (Insyde® InsydeH2O UEFI-BIOS) may allow for the compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The detailed description of the vulnerabilities with at least a medium, high or critical CVSS base score is as follows:

* **CVE-2020-5953:** A vulnerability exists in System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler of InsydeH2O UEFI Firmware code located in SWSMI handler that dereferences gRT (EFI\_RUNTIME\_SERVICES) pointer to call a GetVariable service, which is located outside of SMRAM. This can result in code execution in SMM (escalating privilege from ring 0 to ring -2). It affects the driver AsfSecureBootSmm.
* **CVE-2021-33625:** SMM memory corruption vulnerability in combined DXE/SMM driver on BullSequana Edge server. The vulnerability exists in SW SMI handler registered with GUID `9c28be0c-ee32-43d8-a223-e7c1614ef7ca` and located at offset `0x23B0` in the driver. This affects the HddPassword driver.
* **CVE-2021-33626:** A vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler that does not sufficiently check or validate the allocated buffer pointer (QWORD values for CommBuffer). This can be used by an attacker to corrupt data in SMRAM memory and even lead to arbitrary code execution. It affects the driver SmmResourceCheckDxe.
* **CVE-2021-33627:** A vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler that does not sufficiently check or validate the allocated buffer pointer (CommBuffer). This can be used by an attacker to corrupt data in SMRAM memory and even lead to arbitrary code execution. It affects the driver FwBlockServiceSmm.
* **CVE-2021-41837:** An unsafe pointer vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler. An attacker can use this unsafe pointer "current\_ptr" to read or write or manipulate data into SMRAM. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to escalation of privileges reserved only for SMM using the SwSMI handler. It affects the AhciBusDxe driver.
* **CVE-2021-41838:** An unsafe pointer vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler. An attacker can use this unsafe pointer "ptr" to read or write or manipulate data in the SMRAM. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to escalation of privileges reserved only for SMM using the SwSMI handler. It affects the driver NvmExpressDxe driver.
* **CVE-2021-41839:** A vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler that does not sufficiently check or validate the allocated table variable EFI\_BOOT\_SERVICES. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite address location of any of the functions (FreePool, LocateHandleBuffer, HandleProtocol) to the address location of arbitrary code controlled by the attacker. On system call to SWSMI handler, the arbitrary code can be triggered to execute. It affects the driver NvmExpressDxe.
* **CVE-2021-41840:** A vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler that does not sufficiently check or validate the allocated table variable EFI\_BOOT\_SERVICES. This allows an attacker who is capable of executing code in DXE phase to exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to SMM. The attacker can overwrite the LocateProtocol or Freepool memory address location to execute unwanted code. It affects the driver SdHostDriver.
* **CVE-2021-41841:** A vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler that does not sufficiently check or validate the allocated table variables EFI\_BOOT\_SERVICES and EFI\_RUNTIME\_SERVICES. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite address location of the function (LocateHandleBuffer) to the address location of arbitrary code controlled by the attacker. On system call to SWSMI handler, the arbitrary code can be triggered to execute. It affects the driver AhciBusDxe.
* **CVE-2021-42059:** The stack buffer overflow vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution in UEFI DXE driver on BullSequana Edge server. This affects the DisplayTypeDxe driver.
* **CVE-2021-42060:** SMM callout vulnerability in combined DXE/SMM driver on BullSequana Edge server. The vulnerability exists in SW SMI handler registered with number 0xF9 and located at offset 0x06F0 in the driver. This affects the Int15ServiceSmm driver.
* **CVE-2021-42113:** SMM callout vulnerability in combined DXE/SMM driver on BullSequana Edge server. The vulnerability exists in child SW SMI handler registered with GUID `1d3de7f0-0807-424f-aa69-11a54e19a46f` and located at offset `0x1E0C` in the driver. It affects the StorageSecurityCommandDxe driver.
* **CVE-2021-42554:** SMM memory corruption vulnerability in combined DXE/SMM driver on BullSequana Edge server. The vulnerability exists in SW SMI handler registered with number `0x16` and located at offset `0x3DBC` in the driver. This affects the FvbServicesRuntimeDxe driver.

The use of test keys poses a critical severity risk by making it trivial for remote attackers with administrative privileges to the BMC system to perform a malicious BMC firmware update and defeat U-Boot verified boot on affected devices. This results in a persistent compromise of both the BMC system and the main server operating system. [BRLY-2023-030](/advisories/brly-2023-030)9.1Critical4

## InsydeH2O UEFI software impacted by multiple vulnerabilities in SMM

#### Vulnerability Note VU#796611

Original Release Date: 2022-02-01 | Last Revised: 2023-07-17

---

### Overview

The InsydeH2O Hardware-2-Operating System (H2O) UEFI firmware contains multiple vulnerabilities related to memory management in System Management Mode (SMM).

### Description

UEFI software provides an extensible interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI software uses a highly privileged processor execution mode called System Management Mode (SMM) for handling system-wide functions like power management, system hardware control, or proprietary OEM-designed code. SMM's privileges, also referred to as "Ring -2," exceed the privileges of the operating system's kernel ("Ring-0"). For this reason, SMM is executed in a protected area of memory called the SMRAM. It is typically accessed via System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using communication buffers, which are also known as "SMM Comm Buffers." The SMM also provides protection against SPI flash modifications and performs boot time verifications similar to those performed by [SecureBoot](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot#What_is_UEFI_Secure_Boot.3F).

UEFI software requires both openness (for hardware drivers, pluggable devices and Driver eXecution Environment (DXE) updates) as well as very tight security controls (for e.g., [SMM Comm Buffer Security](https://github.com/tianocore-docs/Docs/raw/master/White_Papers/A_Tour_Beyond_BIOS_Secure_SMM_Communication.pdf)), making it a complex software that needs a thorough set of security controls that need validation throughout the software's lifecycle. UEFI also supports recent capabilities like Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) for virtualization and the increasing demand of virtual computing resources.

Insyde's H2O UEFI firmware contains several (23) memory management vulnerabilities that were disclosed by [Binarly](https://www.binarly.io). While these vulnerabilities were discovered in [Fujitsu](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/) and [Bull Atos](https://atos.net/en/) implementations of Insyde H2O software, the same software is also present in many other vendor implementations due to the complex UEFI supply chain. The vulnerabilities can be classified by the following [UEFI vulnerability categories](https://medium.com/firmware-threat-hunting/uefi-vulnerabilities-classification-4897596e60af).

| Vulnerability Category | Count |
| --- | --- |
| SMM Privilege Escalation | 10 |
| SMM Memory Corruption | 12 |
| DXE Memory Corruption | 1 |

### Impact

The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary widely due to the nature of SMM capabilities. As an example, a local attacker with administrative privileges (or a remote attacker with administrative privileges) can exploit these vulnerabilities to elevate privileges above the operating system to execute arbitrary code in SMM mode. These attacks can be invoked from the operating system using the unverified or unsafe SMI Handlers, and in some cases these bugs can also be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases ( as well as sleep and recovery like [ACPI](https://uefi.org/acpi)) before the operating system is initialized.

In summary, a local attacker with administrative privileges (in some cases a remote attacker with administrative privileges) can use malicious software to perform any of the following:

* Invalidate many hardware security features (SecureBoot, Intel [BootGuard](https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/understanding-the-uefi-secure-boot-chain/secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/intel_boot_guard))
* Install persistent software that cannot be easily erased
* Create backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data

### Solution

Install the latest stable version of firmware provided by your PC vendor or your nearest reseller of your computing environments. See the links below to resources and updates provided by specific vendors.

If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as [Linux Vendor Firmware Service](https://fwupd.org/) (LVFS), apply the related software security updates. Binarly has also provided a set of UEFI software detection rules called [FwHunt rules](https://github.com/binarly-io/FwHunt/tree/main/rules) to assist with identifying vulnerable software. LVFS applies these FwHunt rules to detect and support the fix of firmware updates that are impacted by this advisory.

### Acknowledgements

The efiXplorer team of Binarly researched and reported these vulnerabilities to Insyde Software. Insyde Software worked closely with CERT/CC during the coordinated disclosure process for these vulnerabilities.

#### Vendor Statement

HPE has evaluated the integration of the InsydeH20 UEFI BIOS in HPE products. Most HPE products do not integrate, include, or use the InsydeH20 UEFI BIOS and are therefore not affected by these vulnerabilities. A small number of HPE products do include the InsydeH20 UEFI BIOS, but are not affected by these vulnerabilities due to the way the InsydeH20 UEFI BIOS is implemented. Some HPE Aruba products use the InsydeH20 UEFI BIOS and they are affected by some of these vulnerabilities.

DETAILS
For more information about the HPE Aruba products affected by the InsydeH20 UEFI BIOS vulnerabilities, see the following Aruba Product Security Advisories:
