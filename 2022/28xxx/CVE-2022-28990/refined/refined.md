The provided content relates to CVE-2022-28990.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WASI API, specifically the read/write functions using `iovs`, does not properly validate the buffer address and length of the `iovs` structure. This lack of validation can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow vulnerability.
- Insufficient validation of buffer addresses and lengths in the WASI API `read/write` functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory information leak.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution due to the heap buffer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing malicious input to the WASI API read/write functions (specifically crafted `iovs` with invalid buffer addresses/lengths).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to control the input data to the WASI API functions, specifically the `iovs` structure containing buffer addresses and lengths.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was identified through AddressSanitizer (ASan) which reported a heap-buffer-overflow.
- The vulnerability is present in the `wasm3` project.
- A proof of concept (`poc.wasm`) was used to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- A fix was implemented in pull request #324 and merged into the main branch.
