The provided content relates to CVE-2022-28449.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "Apply for vendor account" feature in nopCommerce allows unrestricted file uploads. The application does not validate the file type or content, allowing a user to upload arbitrary files, including those containing malicious code (e.g., HTML with JavaScript).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** Lack of proper file type validation.
- **Stored XSS:** Uploaded files are stored on the server and when accessed, execute any embedded JavaScript, leading to stored cross-site scripting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could upload a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript code which will be executed when an admin views the vendor application. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing admin session cookies.
    - Defacement: Modifying the website content.
    - Malicious actions: Performing actions on behalf of the admin.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user can use the "Apply for vendor account" form to upload a file. The application saves the uploaded file on the server.
- When the admin views the vendor application information, the uploaded file is rendered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access the "Apply for vendor account" feature. This would typically be a publicly accessible feature of the application.
- No special permissions are required to exploit the vulnerability.
