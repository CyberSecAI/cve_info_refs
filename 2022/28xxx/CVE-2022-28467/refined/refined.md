Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `txtapplicationID` parameter in the Online Student Admission system is vulnerable to SQL injection. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input, specifically the `txtapplicationID` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Boolean-based blind SQL Injection:** The system is susceptible to boolean-based blind SQL injection in the `txtemail` parameter.
*   **Time-based blind SQL Injection:** The system is also susceptible to time-based blind SQL injection in the `txtemail` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can gain control of the administrator account and potentially all other user accounts.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can download all information from the system's database, leading to a significant data breach.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control over the application and underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by submitting crafted payloads in the `txtapplicationID` and `txtemail` parameters of an HTTP POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges are mentioned, implying that this attack can be carried out by an unauthenticated user.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided content includes example payloads to demonstrate the vulnerability:
    *   `txtapplicationID=42711511' or '9502'='9502`
    *   `txtapplicationID=76156004' or '1693'='1699`
    *   `txtemail=AorFztgi@sourcecodester.com/php/14874/online-student-admission-system.html' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (3278=3278) THEN 0x416f72467a74676940736f75726365636f6465737465722e636f6d2f7068702f31343837342f6f6e6c696e652d73747564656e742d61646d697373696f6e2d73797374656d2e68746d6c ELSE 0x28 END)) AND 'ZJbf'='ZJbf&txtapplicationID=50649742711511' or '9502'='9502&btnlogin=`
    *   `txtemail=AorFztgi@sourcecodester.com/php/14874/online-student-admission-system.html' AND (SELECT 6166 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))illi) AND 'pUbk'='pUbk&txtapplicationID=50649742711511' or '9502'='9502&btnlogin=`
*   The payloads demonstrate the usage of logical OR operators and other SQL syntax.
*   The response differences confirm the SQL injection vulnerability.
