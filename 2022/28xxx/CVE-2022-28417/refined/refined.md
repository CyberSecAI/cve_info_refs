The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Home Owners Collection Management System.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `id` parameter of the `delete_phase` function in `Master.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability via the `id` parameter in the `/hocms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_phase` endpoint.
- The application uses the unsanitized input in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- The attacker can retrieve the database version, as demonstrated by the `updatexml` payload.
- Blind SQL injection techniques are also possible, allowing attackers to infer information by observing the server's response or timing.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests to `/hocms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_phase` with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is required as the exploit was performed without login
