## World-class talent that makes a difference.

### For more than 30 years, we’ve challenged the status quo. Together with our partners, we’ve remained curious and hungry for new research, knowledge, and technological advancements that make a positive impact.

WithSecure’s experts experience every digital threat society faces, on the frontlines. As research-led practitioners—not theorists—they  seek out the most challenging cyber security problems they can find. From analyzing the the threat landscape to applying machine learning to cyber security to demonstrating the how a great cyber defense depends on excellent offensive tactics, our people produce unmatched research, insights, and tools that they love to share to anyone who can use them to make a difference.
