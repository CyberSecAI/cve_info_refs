Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28283:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing security checks when fetching `sourceMapURL` in the devtools. The devtools would attempt to fetch source maps from URLs specified in CSS/JS files without proper validation of the scheme, which could potentially allow fetching local files or other inaccessible resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure URL Handling:** The lack of security checks on the `sourceMapURL` allowed the devtools to attempt to fetch resources using schemes like `file://`, `chrome://`, and `resource://` which should be restricted.
- **Privileged Context:** The fetching was performed from a chrome privileged worker which bypassed CORS and other security measures.
- **Information Disclosure:** By loading arbitrary files, the vulnerability could potentially expose sensitive data.
- **Lack of principal:** The requests were not done using the correct principal which caused authentication issues and made timing attacks more practical.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious webpage could attempt to read local files or other resources on the user's machine via the devtools.
- **Timing attacks:** An attacker could use timing attacks to potentially determine some privacy-sensitive stuff.
- **Potentially worse:** While not explicitly stated, the possibility of more serious consequences due to the lack of proper security checks can't be ruled out.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious webpage could specify a `sourceMapURL` pointing to a local file or a privileged URL within the browser.
- The webpage could use a CSS/JS file with a `sourceMappingURL` that points to an attacker-controlled resource or a restricted one.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a webpage to the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `sourceMappingURL` of the webpage, which is usually present in a CSS or JS file.
- The attacker can attempt to fetch arbitrary content from locations reachable by the user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding checks to disallow `chrome://` and `resource://` protocols for sourcemap URLs.
- The vulnerability was initially discovered while investigating an authentication issue with source maps, as the requests were not performed with the correct principal (leading to redundant re-authentication).
- The bug report also discusses potential longer-term solutions, such as moving the fetching of source maps to the DevTools server to enforce proper security and resolve the authentication issues.
- The vulnerability was not considered for uplift to older versions, as a more proper fix was planned.
- Chromium handles this by having a loadFromTarget logic, so it loads the URL from target/frame only if the scheme isn't `file/data/devtools`. Otherwise, it fallbacks to a more privileged API that doesn't do any special checks except for appending `User-Agent` and `Cache-Control`.
