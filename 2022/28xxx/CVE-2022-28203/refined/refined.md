Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `STRAIGHT_JOIN` in SQL queries within MediaWiki's pagers, specifically when filtering results based on an actor (user). The `STRAIGHT_JOIN` forces MySQL to perform joins in a specific order. This can lead to inefficient query execution. When a user specified in the query does not exist, or when combined with a condition that is not met, the database will still scan a large number of rows before it realizes that the query should return an empty set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inefficient SQL Queries:** The use of `STRAIGHT_JOIN` forces the database to scan a large number of rows even when the query should return an empty set.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not check for the existence of the user (actor) before executing the expensive query, contributing to the inefficiency.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting specific requests to `Special:NewFiles` with non-existent actors or conditions that will not be met, an attacker could force the database to perform a large number of unnecessary reads, leading to resource exhaustion, slow performance, and potentially a denial-of-service condition.
- **Performance Degradation:** Even with valid user accounts, the queries could still be slow if the condition on `user_groups` was not met, as the database will scan many rows in the image table before realizing that no user is in the bot group.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP requests:** By sending HTTP requests to the `Special:NewFiles` page with malicious actor parameters or conditions that will not be met.
- **Authenticated or Unauthenticated:**  The vulnerability is exploitable regardless of authentication status, as it exists in the database query logic itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Knowledge of MediaWiki:** The attacker needs to know how to interact with MediaWiki's `Special:NewFiles` page and how to construct relevant parameters.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the MediaWiki instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by using gibberish in the actor name, or by using a legitimate actor name in combination with a condition that is not met.
- The fix involves removing the `STRAIGHT_JOIN` directive and checking if the actor exists in the database before executing the query.
