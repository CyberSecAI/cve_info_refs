- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap overflow in the `NewCodePage` function due to an out-of-bounds write. This is triggered during the compilation of a WebAssembly module, specifically within the `Compile_BranchTable` function, leading to the allocation of a code page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow. The `NewCodePage` function writes past the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Memory corruption leading to crashes.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution, though not explicitly stated in the provided information.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By providing a specially crafted WebAssembly module (`poc.wasm`) that triggers the vulnerable code path.
    - The vulnerability occurs during the compilation process of the provided WASM.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to supply malicious WASM code to a vulnerable system or application using the affected library.
    - No specific privilege required beyond being able to provide the WASM code.
