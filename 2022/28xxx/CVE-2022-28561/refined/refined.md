The provided content is related to a command injection vulnerability in Tenda AX12 routers.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the router's firmware passing user-controlled input directly to the `doSystem` function without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `deviceList` parameter in the `setMacFilterCfg` endpoint is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the router with root privileges. This could lead to complete control of the router, including data exfiltration, network manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via HTTP POST request to `/goform/setMacFilterCfg`. The `deviceList` parameter is injected with shell commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the router and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint. The provided example uses the IP address `192.168.11.1`, which suggests an attack can be performed from within the LAN. Additionally, the attacker needs to know a valid password for the router's web interface, as indicated by the `Cookie: password=...` parameter in the provided POST request.
