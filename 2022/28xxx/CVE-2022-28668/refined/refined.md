**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of J2K files. This leads to a write past the end of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- Improper input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious J2K file.
- Exploitation requires user interaction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious J2K file or trick the user into visiting a malicious page.
- No special privileges are required.
