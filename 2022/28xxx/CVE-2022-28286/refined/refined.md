The provided content relates to CVE-2022-28286.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A layout change caused incorrect clipping of column and column group backgrounds of tables within iframes when the table header cell has stacking context inducing properties. Specifically, the `TableBackgroundColor` item was placed outside the transform item despite having `will-change: transform` set, leading to drawing outside of iframe bounds.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Incorrect clipping of table backgrounds within iframes, allowing content to be drawn outside of iframe boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause user confusion or create spoofing attacks by rendering content from an iframe outside of its boundaries, potentially covering content in the main frame. This could be used to "erase" critical elements or "replace" them with images designed to deceive the viewer.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to control the content of an iframe embedded in a victim page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to convince a user to load a page that embeds a malicious iframe. The attacker controls the content within the iframe.
