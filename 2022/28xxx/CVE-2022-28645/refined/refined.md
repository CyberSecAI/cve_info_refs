Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-28645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of DGN files in Bentley MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications. Specifically, crafted data within a DGN file can cause a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability during DGN file parsing, where the software attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory region. This can lead to information disclosure and potentially other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** In combination with other vulnerabilities, an attacker can leverage the out-of-bounds read to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious DGN File:** The primary attack vector involves a maliciously crafted DGN file.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, as the target must either open the malicious DGN file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and deliver a malicious DGN file to a user of the affected software.
- The attacker does not need specific privileges or a special network position.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Bentley has released updates to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is also associated with other CVEs: CVE-2021-46646, CVE-2022-28642, CVE-2022-28643, and CVE-2022-28644.
- The vulnerability is tracked by ZDI as ZDI-CAN-16470 and ZDI-22-610.
- The CVSS score is 3.3 with vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N for ZDI, and 7.8 with AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H for Bentley.
