The provided content relates to CVE-2022-28451.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the `backupFileName` parameter in the Maintenance feature of nopCommerce.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal: The application does not properly sanitize the `backupFileName` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) into the filename, potentially accessing or creating files in arbitrary locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially overwrite or create files outside of the intended backup directory, potentially leading to:
- Arbitrary file write: Overwriting critical system files could lead to denial of service or system compromise.
- Information disclosure:  Creating files in sensitive locations, like web directories, could lead to information disclosure by reading them through a browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the Maintenance feature with a malicious `backupFileName` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request manually to the affected endpoint (Maintenance feature).
- The attacker needs to have access to the Admin area.
