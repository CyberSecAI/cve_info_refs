The provided content relates to CVE-2022-28995.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization within the rengine application, specifically when processing YAML configuration files. The application directly passes user-supplied YAML configuration data to the `os.system` function without filtering or verification, resulting in command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary vulnerability is command injection, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to validate and sanitize the YAML configuration file before using it in `os.system`, allowing for arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would grant the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server hosting the application. This could lead to:
- Complete server compromise: The attacker could gain full control of the server.
- Data theft or modification: The attacker could steal sensitive information or alter data on the server.
- Denial of service: The attacker could disrupt the normal functioning of the application or the server.
- Lateral movement: The attacker could use the compromised server as a stepping stone to access other systems on the same network.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the YAML configuration file, specifically through the dirsearch functionality that is configured via YAML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to modify or inject malicious content into the YAML configuration files used by rengine.
- The attacker needs to understand that subdomain scanning happens before dirsearch scanning and therefore needs to wait before exploiting the rce vulnerability.
