Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28156:

**CVE-2022-28156**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Pipeline: Phoenix AutoTest Plugin 1.3 and earlier
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin implements a Pipeline step (`copy`) to copy files from the running build's directory on the Jenkins controller to an agent without sanitizing the path specified.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Path Traversal, Arbitrary file copy from Jenkins controller to agent.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can copy arbitrary files and directories from the Jenkins controller to the agent workspace. This could potentially expose sensitive information on the controller or allow further compromise of the build environment.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can configure a pipeline job using the vulnerable `copy` step with a maliciously crafted source path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission within Jenkins.

**Summary:**

The Pipeline: Phoenix AutoTest Plugin's `copy` step fails to sanitize the specified path, allowing users with Item/Configure permission to copy any file from the Jenkins controller to an agent's workspace. This path traversal vulnerability could potentially expose sensitive files and compromise the build environment by copying malicious files.
