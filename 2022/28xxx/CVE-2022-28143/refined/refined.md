Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28143:

**CVE-2022-28143**

*   **Root Cause:** The Proxmox Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, and these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing permission checks:** Multiple HTTP endpoints lack authorization checks.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, allowing for cross-site request forgery attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can:
        *   Connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password (performing a connection test).
        *   Disable SSL/TLS validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM as part of the connection test.
        *   Test a rollback with attacker-specified parameters.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks through HTTP requests.
    *   CSRF attacks, where a malicious request is triggered by a user within their browser session.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Attacker needs Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes**

*   The Proxmox Plugin versions 0.7.0 and earlier are affected by this vulnerability.
*   The fix is available in Proxmox Plugin version 0.7.1, which requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
*  This vulnerability is related to SECURITY-2082
