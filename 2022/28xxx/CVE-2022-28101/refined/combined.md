# HTML Injection Leading to RCE in Turtl

![Cyber Citadel](https://www.cybercitadel.com/wp-content/themes/cybercitadel_v2.1/library/images/defaults/default-postthumb.webp)

**HTML Injection vulnerability found in Turtl Notes, disclosed by Cyber Citadel researchers, could affect iOS and Android users**.

Cyber Citadel’s [Lead Security Researcher Rafay Baloch](https://youtu.be/rPkxU1OJbZM) and Security Researcher Muhammad Samak disclosed an HTML Injection vulnerability found in the Turtl Notes application, which could lead to a potential RCE and NTLMv2 hash disclosure via abusing the arbitrary URI schemes.

![Turtl Notes user interface](https://www.cybercitadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/turtl-072.png)
## Turtl Notes

[Turtl Notes](https://turtlapp.com/) is a cross-platform application that focuses on note-taking collaboration. The online service provides users with a notebook sharing platform that allows notes to be organised easily, synchronised across devices, shared with other Turtl users and shared via email. The application has been downloaded 10,000+ times on Google Play and an unknown number of times from the Turtl’s website for Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS.

While Turtl encrypts user data, with an impressive 2,048-bit key encryption system, and boasts the implementation of high-grade firewalls, that protect from DDoS attacks, the HTML Injection vulnerability, found by Rafay Baloch and Muhammad Samak, has exposed a critical flaw in Turtl’s software.

### **[orthecreedence](/orthecreedence)** commented [Dec 13, 2021](#issue-1079064966)

| Notes allow `<meta>` tag injection. Ie, a note with the content  ``` <META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0; URL=https://google.com">  ```  opens a new browser window to Google. While this problem would happen over person-to-person sharing and thus the severity is limited (because you generally only share with those you trust) it remains high priority.  Special thanks to Rafay Baloch and Muhammad Samak for this report. |
