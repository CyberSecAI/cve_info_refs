- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a type of out-of-bounds write, which can be caused by writing data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This is a classic memory corruption issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L). The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R) and does not require any privileges (PR:N) and the scope is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability, which is a user-initiated action.
