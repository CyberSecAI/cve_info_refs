{
  "CVE-2022-28327": {
    "description": "A crafted scalar input longer than 32 bytes can cause P256().ScalarMult or P256().ScalarBaseMult to panic in the generic P-256 feature in crypto/elliptic in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1. Indirect uses through crypto/ecdsa and crypto/tls are unaffected. amd64, arm64, ppc64le, and s390x are unaffected.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the crypto/elliptic library when handling scalar inputs for P-256 elliptic curve operations. An oversized scalar input can trigger a panic.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Potential for panic due to oversized scalar"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition as the application will panic and terminate.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves providing a crafted scalar input to P256().ScalarMult or P256().ScalarBaseMult. This is not directly exploitable via `crypto/ecdsa` or `crypto/tls`, suggesting that the vulnerable code needs to be directly called by attacker or some other code that attacker has control over.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted scalar inputs directly to the vulnerable functions in order to trigger the panic."
