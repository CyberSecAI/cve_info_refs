The provided content does not contain any information about a specific CVE or vulnerability. It appears to be a collection of HTML pages from GitHub. The first one is a README file from a project called "Roothub" which is a forum system developed using Spring, SpringMVC, Mybatis, and MySQL. It also includes instructions on how to set up and run the project. The second one is a landing page for a different GitHub repository called "Roothub\_vulns," which currently appears to be empty. Therefore, I cannot extract any relevant vulnerability information.
