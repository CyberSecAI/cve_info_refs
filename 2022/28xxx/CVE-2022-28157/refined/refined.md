Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-28157:

**CVE-2022-28157**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** Pipeline: Phoenix AutoTest Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.3 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin implements a Pipeline step (`ftp`) to upload files to an FTP server, but it does not limit the source directory from which files can be uploaded.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and proper access control on the source directory when using the `ftp` pipeline step.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with `Item/Configure` permission for a Jenkins job can define a pipeline that uses the vulnerable `ftp` step. By controlling the pipeline script, the attacker can specify the source files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to have `Item/Configure` permission for a Jenkins job.
    *   Attacker needs to be able to write a Jenkins pipeline script
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller to an attacker-specified FTP server. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data from the Jenkins controller, such as secrets, configuration files, or source code.
