{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `GetParentControlInfo` function in `/bin/tdhttpd` does not validate the length of the `mac` POST parameter before copying it to heap memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap overflow vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` with an overly long `mac` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device's web interface, which would typically be on the local network unless remote access is enabled."
