| **Steps to reproduce:**   1. Login as administrative user 2. Create a new proxy host entry with the payload `<script>alert('XSS')</script>.google.com` as domain 3. Hit save 4. Try to delete the newly added proxy host. XSS payload is executed.   [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21357789/159934202-5dd026dc-1cd2-4f8d-a54a-63754fed4e58.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21357789/159934888-1d864ee7-7906-4ea5-83b8-64a2bc4d69cb.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21357789/159934534-a6eef6a2-4bd5-4886-830d-0ab90f63298c.png)  **Recommendation:**  Implementing input validation and/or ensuring output sanitization as done for all other inputs/outputs.  **Risk:**  Low risk since high privileges are required. |
