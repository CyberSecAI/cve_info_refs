Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-28868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The address bar in the F-Secure Internet Security Browser for Android may display the URL of the next page to be loaded before it actually loads. This temporary display of the next URL can be exploited by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious webpage/URL such that when a user clicks it, the address bar briefly shows a legitimate domain, while the content is actually from the attacker's controlled site. This can trick the user into believing they are on a trusted website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted malicious webpage/URL that an attacker would need to convince a user to click.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious webpage and lure the victim into visiting it. The attacker does not need a privileged position on the victim's device or network.
