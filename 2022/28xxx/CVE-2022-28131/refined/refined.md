  "CVE-2022-28131": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2022-28131",
      "Description": "Uncontrolled recursion in Decoder.Skip in encoding/xml before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker to cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via a deeply nested XML document.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "CWE-674"
        ],
      "CVSS": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The `Decoder.Skip` function in the `encoding/xml` package used recursion to traverse XML elements. When processing deeply nested XML structures, this recursion could lead to stack exhaustion.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Uncontrolled recursion"
        ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted XML document, leading to a panic due to stack exhaustion.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and does not need any special privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.",
       "Affected Versions": "Go versions before 1.17.12, and Go 1.18.x versions before 1.18.4 are vulnerable."
    },
     "Affected Packages": [
        {
          "name": "encoding/xml",
          "versions": [
            "before go1.17.12",
            "from go1.18.0-0 before go1.18.4"
           ],
           "symbols": [
              "Decoder.Skip"
            ]
        }
      ],
    "Additional Information": {
      "Fix": "The vulnerability was fixed by changing `Decoder.Skip` to use iteration instead of recursion.",
