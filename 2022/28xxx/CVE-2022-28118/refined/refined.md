Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-28118

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way SiteServer CMS handles plugin installations. It allows for the execution of arbitrary code during the installation of a malicious plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted Plugin Installation:** The system lacks proper validation and restrictions on the content of uploaded plugins. This allows attackers to include malicious code within a plugin.
*   **Code Execution During Installation:** The system executes code within the plugin during installation. This creates a pathway for the attacker's malicious code to be run on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the SiteServer CMS.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control over the affected server.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers may be able to access sensitive data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Plugin Upload:** Attackers upload a crafted malicious plugin through the CMS plugin installation functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious plugin creation:** The attacker must be able to create a plugin that contains malicious code.
*   **Access to plugin upload functionality:** The attacker must have access to the plugin upload feature of SiteServer CMS.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `IPluginConfigureServices` interface within the plugin, specifically within the `ConfigureServices` method where malicious code can be added.
*   The provided exploit code uses `System.Net.Sockets` and `System.Diagnostics` to establish a reverse shell connection back to the attacker.
*   The malicious plugin when installed establishes a connection to the attacker specified IP and port and executes commands provided by the attacker.

**Additional Information**

*   The issue was reported by user Richard-Tang.
*   The affected versions are >= 7.0.0.
*   There are no patched versions available as of the provided content.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical).
*   The vulnerability is present in the SiteServer CMS application.
