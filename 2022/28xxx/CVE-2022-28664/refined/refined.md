The provided content is related to CVE-2022-28664.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `unescape` function in FreshTomato's `httpd` component incorrectly assumes that a '%' character in a URL-encoded string is always followed by two hexadecimal characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation in the `unescape` function.
- Out-of-bounds read and write due to the incorrect assumption about the length of the URL-encoded sequences.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption.
- The specific impact (e.g., denial of service, arbitrary code execution) is not explicitly mentioned but the report implies this is a possibility.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a URL-encoded string with a '%' character not followed by two hexadecimal characters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device (router).
- No authentication is required (as the CVSS score indicates a "No Privileges Required" attack).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects the `mips` branch of FreshTomato.
- The vulnerability was found in the `cgi.c` file, specifically in the `unescape` function.
- The vulnerability is present in FreshTomato 2022.1.
- The provided code snippet illustrates how the `unescape` function works and how the vulnerability can be triggered.
