Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28711:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the `unescape` function in `cgi.c` of ArduPilot's APWeb component. This function is intended to decode URL-encoded strings. The root cause is that the function incorrectly assumes that after a '%' character in the input string, there will always be two hex characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `unescape` function fails to properly validate the input string after encountering a '%' character. Specifically, it doesn't check if there are two subsequent characters to convert from hex.
- **Out-of-bounds read and write:** When a '%' is followed by less than 2 characters, `memcpy` attempts to read beyond the input buffer, which could also lead to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The primary impact is memory corruption due to out-of-bounds read and potential out-of-bounds write. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Loss of integrity and availability: Memory corruption could lead to unpredictable behavior such as crashes or application failures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network request: An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request containing a URL-encoded string that exploits the vulnerability to a vulnerable APWeb instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network requests to a vulnerable ArduPilot APWeb instance. No prior authentication or user interaction is needed.
