## CVE-2022-28290 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in Welaunch

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### Welaunch

#### Affected Product

##### WordPress Country Selector

#### CVE

##### CVE-2022-28290

#### Securin ID

##### 2022-CSW-03-1055

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### March 25, 2022

### Description

Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks are also known as non-persistent attacks which occur when a malicious script is reflected back from a web application to the victim’s browser. The script is activated through a link, which sends a request to the website with a vulnerability that enables the execution of malicious scripts.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

1. After installing the Country Selector Plugin, go to the homepage of the WordPress site.
2. Capture all the requests and find the POST request to the AJAX call of check\_country\_selector.

***![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cve-2022-28290_1-e1673063516438.png)***

***Figure 01: Original AJAX Request***

3. Enter the payload – <img+src=x+onerror=alert(document.cookie)> in the country parameter and <img+src=x+onerror=alert(document.cookie)> in the lang parameter.

***Figure 02: Injected XSS Payloads in âcountryâ and âlangâ Parameter***

4. Forward the request
5. Injected XSS payload will be reflected and triggered on the userâs browser.

### Impact

An attacker can perform the following:

* Inject malicious code into the vulnerable variable and exploit the application through the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
* Modify the code and get the session information of other users.
* Compromise the user machine.

### Remediations

* Perform context-sensitive encoding of entrusted input before it is echoed back to a browser using an encoding library throughout the application.
* Implement input validation for special characters on all the variables that are reflected in the browser and stored in the database.
* Explicitly set the character set encoding for each page generated by the webserver.
* Encode dynamic output elements and filter specific characters in dynamic elements.

### Timeline

**March 24, 2022:** Discovered in `WordPress Country Selector Plugin Version 1.6.5` Product

**March 25, 2022:** Reported to Welaunch

**March 29, 2022:** Acknowledged by Welaunch

**March 30, 2022:** Vendor Released Patch for XSS Vulnerability
