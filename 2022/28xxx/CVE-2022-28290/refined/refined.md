- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Country Selector plugin version 1.6.5 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input validation and output encoding of the `country` and `lang` parameters in the AJAX call of `check_country_selector`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable parameters which get executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser context.
    - Modification of page content.
    - Theft of session information.
    - Potential compromise of the user's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is triggered by crafting a malicious POST request to the AJAX call of `check_country_selector` with the XSS payload injected into the `country` and `lang` parameters. The malicious script is then reflected back to the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. The user must visit a page that triggers the AJAX request that reflects the malicious code.
