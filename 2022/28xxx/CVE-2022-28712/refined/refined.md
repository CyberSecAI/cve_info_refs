Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the video title when it's saved and displayed on the webpage. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `setTitle` function within `objects/video.php` which results in unsanitized user input being used directly when rendering the page through the `getVideosListItem` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the video title field, which is then stored in the database. When the video title is displayed on the page, this JavaScript code is executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
- **Account Takeover:**  In the worst-case scenario, the attacker can potentially take over an administrator's account if the malicious JavaScript is executed in the context of an administrator's session.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker can steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or manipulate the content of the page.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `objects/videoAddNew.json.php` to inject the XSS payload into the video title. This requires an authenticated user with video upload permissions.
- **User Interaction:** The XSS is triggered when a user visits a page that displays the video containing the malicious title via `getVideosListItem` (e.g., video page, video list page).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:**  The attacker must have an account with video upload permissions to add a new video or modify existing ones.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to lure a user (potentially an admin) to visit a page which renders the malicious video title via `getVideosListItem`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability resides within `objects/video.php` where the `setTitle` method does not sanitize the input title and is later used unsanitized within the `getVideosListItem` function.
- Specifically, the title from the database is inserted directly into an HTML string in the `getVideosListItem` function in the file `objects/video.php` without sanitization, leading to XSS.
- The `videoAddNew.json.php` allows to set a video title, which is not properly sanitized by the setTitle method of the video class, allowing for the stored XSS.
- The XSS can be triggered by visiting the video page (e.g., `https://192.168.1.200/video/135`).

**Additional notes:**
- The TALOS advisory indicates that the vendor has fixed the vulnerability on July 7th, 2022.
- The advisory provides a specific Proof of Concept (PoC) using curl to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The advisory lists specific files where the stored XSS vulnerability can be triggered: `view/modeYoutubeBottomRight.php`, `view/videoViewsInfo.php` and `view/videosList.php`.
