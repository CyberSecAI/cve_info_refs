Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28133:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The Bitbucket Server Integration Plugin versions 2.0.0 through 3.1.0 do not limit URL schemes for callback URLs on OAuth consumers. This means that the plugin allows for the creation of OAuth consumers with arbitrary callback URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of URL scheme validation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code by crafting a callback URL with a `javascript:` scheme. This code is then stored within the plugin's configuration and executed when the callback URL is accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker who can create BitBucket Server consumers can achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the user's browser by using the stored XSS payload. This could allow the attacker to steal credentials, perform actions on the victim's behalf, or compromise the Jenkins instance.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker would need the ability to create BitBucket Server consumers within Jenkins. This implies that the attacker has some level of access to the Jenkins instance to perform this action.
- The attacker creates a malicious OAuth consumer with a callback URL that uses the `javascript:` scheme.
- When a user interacts with the OAuth consumer configured with a malicious callback, the stored JavaScript is executed in their browser

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have permissions to create BitBucket Server consumers within the Jenkins instance to exploit this stored XSS. This could be obtained by having Overall/Administer access, or potentially through exploiting another vulnerability to escalate privileges.
