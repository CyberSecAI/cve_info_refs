  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the use of a predictable value to sign and verify `_fragment` URLs within the Spryker Commerce OS. The secret used for signing is derived from `md5(__DIR__)`, where `__DIR__` is a PHP magic constant representing the directory of the file. This makes the secret static and predictable, because the directory structure of the application can often be guessed or is publicly available.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The main vulnerability is the usage of a predictable, static secret for signing `_fragment` URLs. This allows attackers to generate valid signatures by computing the md5 hash of a predictable file path. The vulnerable code is located within the `spryker/http` module of Spryker Commerce OS.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for Remote Command Execution (RCE). By crafting malicious `_fragment` URLs and utilizing the predictable secret, attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code, which can then lead to operating system-level command execution. This can result in the attacker gaining full control of the server, accessing sensitive customer data, modifying files, and performing other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the `_fragment` endpoint. By supplying a specially crafted `_path` parameter, attackers can target specific PHP classes and methods. They can then use the `Symfony\\Component\\Filesystem\\Filesystem` class and its `appendToFile` method to write arbitrary content to any file on the system. This is used to inject a minimal web shell for arbitrary command execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Spryker Commerce OS instance. They must be able to determine that the target application is indeed using Spryker Commerce OS and guess the installation path or obtain it from public information (such as Docker guides). No authentication is needed in most cases as the vulnerability can be exploited without prior login. The attacker should also be able to generate the proper HMAC signature with the known secret."
