- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious link with the vulnerable `a` and `b` GET parameters containing malicious JavaScript code. The victim needs to access the crafted link, which requires user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a user with access to AEM Author to click on it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
