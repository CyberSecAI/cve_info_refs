### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Announcing Scala.js 1.10.0

Apr 4, 2022.

We are pleased to announce the release of Scala.js 1.10.0!

**This release addresses a security vulnerability in `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()`.**
All versions of Scala.js prior to 1.10.0 are affected, including all 0.6.x versions.
We strongly recommend that all users upgrade to Scala.js 1.10.0 as soon as possible.
Read [the security advisory](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/security/advisories/GHSA-j2f9-w8wh-9ww4) for more details.
The issue was registered as [CVE-2022-28355](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28355).

This release also brings a new mode of module splitting, which creates the smallest possible modules for a given list of packages, and the fewest possible modules for the rest.

Finally, it contains some minor optimizations, notably contributed by [@japgolly](https://github.com/japgolly).

Read on for more details.

## Getting started

If you are new to Scala.js, head over to [the tutorial](/tutorial/).

If you need help with anything related to Scala.js, you may find our community [in `#scala-js` on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/scala) and [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scala.js).

Bug reports can be filed [on GitHub](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues).

## Release notes

If upgrading from Scala.js 0.6.x, make sure to read [the release notes of Scala.js 1.0.0](/news/2020/02/25/announcing-scalajs-1.0.0/) first, as they contain a host of important information, including breaking changes.

This is a **minor** release:

* It is backward binary compatible with all earlier versions in the 1.x series: libraries compiled with 1.0.x through 1.9.x can be used with 1.10.0 without change.
* Despite being a minor release, 1.10.0 is forward binary compatible with 1.8.x and 1.9.x. It is *not* forward binary compatible with 1.7.x. Libraries compiled with 1.10.0 can be used with 1.8.x and 1.9.x but not with 1.7.x or earlier.
* It is *not* entirely backward source compatible: it is not guaranteed that a codebase will compile *as is* when upgrading from 1.9.x (in particular in the presence of `-Xfatal-warnings`).

As a reminder, libraries compiled with 0.6.x cannot be used with Scala.js 1.x; they must be republished with 1.x first.

## Fixes with compatibility concerns

### `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()` now depends on `java.security.SecureRandom`, which is provided by external libraries

Until Scala.js 1.9.x, `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()` was implemented using `java.util.Random`, which is not cryptographically secure.
This is therefore a security issue concerning `randomUUID()`.
To address that, Scala.js 1.10.x uses `java.security.SecureRandom` in the implementation of the latter instead.
`java.util.Random` remains unchanged, since it correctly implements its (deterministic) specification.

However, `SecureRandom` cannot be implemented on all JavaScript environments, as ECMAScript, per se, lacks any primitive to access a good source of entropy.
While it can be implemented on top of browser APIs or Node.js APIs, we have no decent fallback for other cases.
Not fully implementing it correctly for all platforms would go against our policy for the standard library, i.e., that linking code must be correct.
Therefore, Scala.js core does not provide any implementation of `java.security.SecureRandom`.

This means that code that was previously calling `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()` will now fail to link.
To preserve binary compatibility, we introduce two variants of a library that provides `java.security.SecureRandom`:

* [`scalajs-java-securerandom`](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-java-securerandom) provides a *correct*, cryptographically secure implementation of `java.security.SecureRandom`, but relies on the Node.js `crypto` module or the Web Crypto API `crypto.getRandomValues` to be available (e.g., in browsers).
* [`scalajs-fake-insecure-java-securerandom`](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-fake-insecure-java-securerandom) is a fake, *insecure* implementation that works in any ECMAScript environment. The only reason this exists is to unblock migration from Scala.js 1.9.x and earlier, in situations that require `randomUUID()` and can accept that they will be insecure.

Due to the changes in the core library, you may encounter linking errors when upgrading to Scala.js 1.10.0, such as:

```
[error] Referring to non-existent class java.security.SecureRandom
[error]   called from private java.util.UUID$.csprng$lzycompute()java.util.Random
[error]   called from private java.util.UUID$.csprng()java.util.Random
[error]   called from java.util.UUID$.randomUUID()java.util.UUID
[error]   called from static java.util.UUID.randomUUID()java.util.UUID
[error]   called from helloworld.HelloWorld$.main([java.lang.String)void
[error]   called from static helloworld.HelloWorld.main([java.lang.String)void
[error]   called from core module module initializers
[error] involving instantiated classes:
[error]   java.util.UUID$
[error]   helloworld.HelloWorld$
```

You may fix these linking errors by adding the following dependency to your `libraryDependencies`:

```
"org.scala-js" %%% "scalajs-java-securerandom" % "1.0.0"
```

As mentioned above, this will only work in environments that either provide the Web Crypto API, or Node.jsâ `crypto` module.

If you need random UUID generation in other environments, we encourage you to implement it yourselves.
Find out if your environment provides a source of cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers.
If it does, you may want to use it to shim `crypto.getRandomValues`, and/or send a pull request to [`scalajs-java-securerandom`](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-java-securerandom).
Otherwise, replace calls to `randomUUID()` with another implementation, in a way that corresponds to your requirements in terms of security and collision likelihood.

If you have **no other choice**, depend on `scalajs-fake-insecure-java-securerandom` instead.
As its name implies, this is an *insecure* implementation, and you should get rid of this dependency as soon as possible.

## New module split style: `SmallModulesFor(packages)`

Prior to 1.10.0, Scala.js had two opposite module split styles:

* `FewestModules` (the default), which generates as few modules as possible, and
* `SmallestModules`, which generates as many small modules as possible (up to one per class).

As detailed in [#4327](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/4327), those two extremes both suffered from issues for iterative development.

Scala.js 1.10.0 introduces a third style, `ModuleSplitStyle.SmallModulesFor(packages: List[String])`.
That style creates as many small modules as possibles for the classes in the listed packages (and their subpackages).
For all other classes, it generates as few modules as possible.
It is a combination of the previously existing styles.

The typical usage pattern is to list the applicationâs packages as argument.
This way, often-changing classes receive independent, small modules, while the stable classes coming from libraries are bundled together as much as possible.
For example, if your application code lives in `com.example.myapp`, you could configure your module split style as:

```
import org.scalajs.linker.interface.ModuleSplitStyle
scalaJSLinkerConfig ~= (_.withModuleSplitStyle(ModuleSplitStyle.SmallModulesFor(List("com.example.myapp"))))
```
## Miscellaneous

### Optimizations

Scala.js 1.10.0 brings some new optimizations to the produced JavaScript files:

* Closures that do not need to capture anything produce simple lambdas, instead of redundant IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions); contributed by [@japgolly](https://github.com/japgolly)
* `js.dynamicImport` blocks that do nothing but access a native JS class, object or member from a JS module avoid creating an intermediate Scala.js-generated module; instead they directly refer to the target JS module in the generated dynamic `import()` call.

## Bug fixes

Among others, the following bugs have been fixed in 1.10.0:

* [#4657](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/4657) Scala.js should not provide a cryptographically insecure `UUID.randomUUID()` implementation

| I'm specifically referencing this section of code:     [scala-js/javalib/src/main/scala/java/util/UUID.scala](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/blob/058532aa8c504b76431b40e3e1b51b2cdef87643/javalib/src/main/scala/java/util/UUID.scala#L139-L147)  Lines 139 to 147 in [058532a](/scala-js/scala-js/commit/058532aa8c504b76431b40e3e1b51b2cdef87643)   |  | private lazy val rng = new Random() // TODO Use java.security.SecureRandom | | --- | --- | |  |  | |  | def randomUUID(): UUID = { | |  | val i1 = rng.nextInt() | |  | val i2 = (rng.nextInt() & ~0x0000f000) | 0x00004000 | |  | val i3 = (rng.nextInt() & ~0xc0000000) | 0x80000000 | |  | val i4 = rng.nextInt() | |  | new UUID(i1, i2, i3, i4, null, null) | |  | } |      The Java 8 docs for `UUID.randomUUID()` state:  Static factory to retrieve a type 4 (pseudo randomly generated) UUID. The UUID is generated using a cryptographically strong pseudo random number generator.  Furthermore, <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-uuid> states that:  Developers who have not been exposed to RFC 4122 might naturally opt to invent their own approaches to UUID generation, potentially using `Math.random()` (in TIFU by using `Math.random()` there's an in-depth discussion of why a Cryptographically-Secure-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator (*CSPRNG*) should be used when generating UUIDs).  It's unclear to me how a developer cross-compiling their library or application for Scala.js should become aware that in fact they cannot rely on `UUID.randomUUID()` for cryptographically strong UUIDs.  This seems a lot like a CVE to me.  See also discussion in [typelevel/cats-effect#2882 (comment)](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/issues/2882#issuecomment-1079502344).  PS would be good to set up a security policy at <https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/security>. |

| That is very unfortunate, and concerning.  This code was introduced during the infancy of Scala.js, 8 years ago: [b1e239d](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/commit/b1e239d2678214396f464509cae7e58c97385460) I don't think it would have passed review in the later years.  Unfortunately, removing the method now is not an option, since that would break backward binary compatibility. We can only do so in Scala.js 2.0.0.  The best we can do is mitigate the issue by using the available secure random facilities of recent browsers and Node.js when they are there. Hopefully, that will be good enough, as it's unlikely that such kind of security would be a concern in another obscure environment.   ---   I've never had to submit a CVE. I'll have to check what is involved there. |

| We might do a similar thing we did with weakref for java.secure.Random or UUID. That would isolate the CVE into a single "fake" package.  Most users will likely be OK to depend on `crypto`, so they can take the real package. |

| Thanks for your attention to this.  I was also thinking along the lines of of [@gzm0](https://github.com/gzm0)'s suggestion: isolate the current implementation into an aptly named "not-cryptographically-strong-uuid-use-at-your-own-risk" package, like the fake weakref. Then provide "webcrypto-uuid" and "node-uuid" packages, for example.  Hopefully, that will be good enough, as it's unlikely that such kind of security would be a concern in another obscure environment.  IMO I think it's best to let the users make this sort of judgement call. |

| Ah yes, we could use a trick similar to `WeakReference`.  The situation is a bit different, though, since for `WeakReference`, the entire *classes* were broken without `WeakRef` support. Here, most of `UUID` is just fine. The only problematic method is `randomUUID`. There could be a number of libraries that only need to manipulate UUIDs, but not generate them using `randomUUID`. These libraries would have to make a choice on what `UUID` support library they depend on, for no reason, but it would have consequences for their users.  We might need to be a bit more creative than for the weak references. |

| These libraries would have to make a choice on what UUID support library they depend on, for no reason  Well, not really. Libraries won't need UUID support for *compiling*. They may need it to run their tests, but that's only a test dependency.  I do agree with your point though, that this is confusing. |

| The alternative is that we implement `java.security.SecureRandom` in that package and simply depend on it from `UUID`. (similar to what we do with `java.text`). The downside is that we likely increase the vulnerability surface in the vulnerable package. |

| That's tempting from a linking architecture point of view but:  The downside is that we likely increase the vulnerability surface in the vulnerable package.  That is probably not acceptable. That would mean deliberately introduce in the ecosystem vulnerabilities that do not exist today, in order to mitigate one that does. Plus, while `UUID.randomUUID` is specified as cryptographically secure, it's another level of expectation for `SecureRandom` whose *name* says that it's secure. |

| Ok, here's a new idea: what if we extract UUID into a separate artifact, that supports both Node.js and WebCrypto and throws a runtime error otherwise. This should cover the majority of use-cases, so libraries can depend on it without too much disruption for their users.  By keeping it a separate artifact, it still gives opportunity for applications to specifically exclude that dependency and replace it with something else suitable for their obscure environment. It's not very convenient to do this, but it is possible.  I think it's best to avoid providing the insecure implementation *anywhere*, if possible. It's what started this mess to begin with.  Bonus points: add something to the sbt-scalajs plugin to make it easy to exclude the default UUID dependency. |

| throws a runtime error otherwise  Well, if we are willing to go down that path, we can provide a `SecureRandom` that throws a runtime error. That would essentially have the same effect, without making the other parts of UUID unusable.  But at that point, I do not see the upside of this compared to making `randomUUID` not link anymore (except for honoring binary compatibility to the letter). |

| I have requested a CVE for this issue. We'll see whether they actually give us one. From what I read about CVEs, this is a bit borderline when it comes to what "deserves" a CVE or not (it's a library method, and an actual vulnerability can only be created in a context-dependent fashion, based on how it's used).   ---   I have given more thoughts about the possible fixes here, also talking to some other people here to get ideas. I am actually warming up to the idea of depending on `SecureRandom`, and implement `SecureRandom` in two different libraries:   * the fully secure one, requiring webcrypto or Node.'s crypto module (and otherwise throwing) * the insecure one, in which we could actually implement something *decent*, while still advertising it as insecure.   For the latter, we could implement some CSPRNG algorithm. We would have to seed with a relatively bad source such as a combination of time + `Math.random`. But at least it would reduce the attack vector to having to guess that initial seed, as opposed to observing any publicly created UUID. |

| Thanks for looking into the CVE.  Yes, I like the `SecureRandom` idea too. That plan makes sense.  the insecure one, in which we could actually implement something decent, while still advertising it as insecure.  This also sounds like a good idea, and is certainly better than using an insecure PRNG :) FWIW I'm still not entirely sure if anybody actually needs this, but I guess it's good to have just in case? |

| After discussion with the Scala Center, actually implementing the CSPRNG as fallback in the insecure version does not seem to be worth it. At least not as an urgent thing to do right now.  [@gzm0](https://github.com/gzm0) If that seems OK to you, I'll proceed with creating two repos for `SecureRandom`. I guess the names could be `scala-js-java-securerandom` and `scala-js-fake-insecure-java-securerandom`. Does the latter reads "bad enough"? |

| OK, the 3 PRs are open.  As I see it, the next steps are:   1. Get approval on [Fix #4657: Implement UUID.randomUUID() using java.security.SecureRandom. #4659](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/pull/4659), [Initial implementation. scala-js-fake-insecure-java-securerandom#1](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-fake-insecure-java-securerandom/pull/1) and [Initial implementation. scala-js-java-securerandom#1](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-java-securerandom/pull/1) 2. Merge [Fix #4657: Implement UUID.randomUUID() using java.security.SecureRandom. #4659](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/pull/4659) 3. Update the other two PRs to point to the resulting scala-js/scala-js head commit 4. Merge them when the CI passes 5. Launch the release process for Scala.js v1.10.0 6. Once artifacts are published, update the two securerandom libraries to use the released v1.10.0, and release them 7. Publish release notes for Scala.js v1.10.0 8. Issue a proper security advisory that tells people to upgrade to Scala.js v1.10.0   (I am still waiting for a reply about the CVE number.) |

## Description

### Impact

Generation of insufficiently random numbers in `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()` allows attackers to predict future generated UUIDs via observation of previously generated UUIDs (observing a single generated UUID may be sufficient). Depending on whether and how particular applications expose and use the generated UUIDs, the actual vector and impact vary.

If you use `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()` to generate user-visible UUIDs, and predicting subsequent UUIDs poses a security risk to your application, you are affected.

In addition, the underlying PRNG has only 48 bits of state, which means that at most 2^48 different UUIDs may be generated by `randomUUID()`. This can cause likely collisions between generated UUIDs.

### Patches

Scala.js v1.10.0 fixes the issue. It uses `java.security.SecureRandom` to implement `randomUUID()`.

`java.security.SecureRandom` is *not* provided by Scala.js core. Therefore, to be able to use `randomUUID()`, you will need to add a dependency on [`scalajs-java-securerandom`](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-java-securerandom). Failing to do so will result in linking errors (i.e., `fastLinkJS`/`fullLinkJS` will fail).

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade, you should generate UUIDs using a different method than `randomUUID()`. Use a better random number generator, for example [`crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues) in browsers or [`require("crypto").randomFillSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptorandomfillsyncbuffer-offset-size) in Node.js.
