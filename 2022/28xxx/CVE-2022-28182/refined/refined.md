- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write due to a specially crafted shader.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the DirectX11 user mode driver (`nvwgf2um/x.dll`).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. The scope of impact may extend to other components.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthorized attacker on the network with the ability to craft a malicious shader.
