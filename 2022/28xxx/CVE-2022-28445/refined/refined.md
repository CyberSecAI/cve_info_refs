Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization in the `fileedit.html` functionality of KiteCMS. The application uses base64 encoding to obfuscate the file path, but it does not properly validate or sanitize the decoded path before using it to access files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** The primary weakness is the ability to read arbitrary files on the server. By manipulating the `path` parameter, an attacker can access any file within the webserver's accessible directories.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application relies on user-provided input (the base64 encoded path) to access files, without sufficient validation, leading to an insecure direct object reference vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The base64 encoded path is decoded and used directly without checking if the decoded path is within the allowed directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files such as database configuration files (e.g., `database.php`), source code, configuration files, or any other file that the web server user has access to.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposure of database credentials can lead to full system compromise.
*   **Confidentiality breach:** Reading configuration files could expose sensitive information about system settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the `path` parameter in the URL when accessing the `fileedit.html` page. An attacker can provide a base64 encoded path to a file they want to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Backend Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface of KiteCMS (i.e., needs to be logged in).
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs knowledge of the server's file system to specify file paths to access.  In this case, the attacker inferred the path from the git repository.
