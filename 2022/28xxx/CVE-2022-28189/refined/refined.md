- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A NULL pointer dereference in the `nvlddmkm.sys` driver during the handling of the DxgkDdiEscape function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: NULL pointer dereference due to improper handling or validation within the DxgkDdiEscape handler.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A system crash can occur leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is needed to trigger this vulnerability by interacting with the DxgkDdiEscape handler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unprivileged regular user with local access to the system is required to trigger the vulnerability.
