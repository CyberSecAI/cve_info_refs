## **Introduction**

This simple project is an **Online Sports Complex Booking System**. This project is a web-based application that provides an online booking platform for **Sports Complex Facilities**. The application allows the said business management to provide their clients or possible client an automated and online platform where they can explore their facilities that are for rent. The possible clients can book their desired facility or facilities if it is available on the date they wanted. This application has a simple and pleasant user interface. This project contains user-friendly features and functionalities.

## **About the Online Sports Complex Booking System**

I developed this project using the following:

* **[XAMPP v3.3.0](https://apachefriends.org)**
* **PHP**
* **MySQL Database**
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**
* **Ajax**
* **jQuery**
* **Bootstrap**
* **Font-awesome**
* **Bootstrap DataTables**
* **AdminLTE Template**

This **Simple Online Sports Complex Booking System** can be accessed by the **Management Admin or Staff, Registered or Possible Clients, and to the Public**. This project has an **Admin Panel** where the management manages the data in the system such as the list of the facilities. The **Admin Panel** can be accessed by 2 different user roles which are the **Admin** and the **Staff**. The **Admin Users** have the privilege to access all the features and functionalities on this side while the **Staff User** has only limited. The possible client can simply register their own account in order them to gain access to the booking feature of the system. Clients can book the facilities they wanted on their desired date as long as the dates do not complicate with the other bookings. The client-side has a booking list where their new and previously booked facilities are listed with details. In this system, **Anonymous Visitors** can explore the facilities and information about the system of the business.

### [Drawback software NO TIME selection only date.](/comment/105472#comment-105472)

This program work straight forward (where minor glitch on images and logo exist) but managable that you can replace in the upload folder.
The only drawback on this software is NO TIME selection is available . . so more work required
