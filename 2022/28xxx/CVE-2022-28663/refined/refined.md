- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure occurs while parsing specially crafted .NEU files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads a malicious .NEU file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious .NEU file. User interaction is required. The attacker would need to craft a malicious .NEU file.
