Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-28314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files within Bentley MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications. Specifically, crafted data within an IFC file can cause a write operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software attempts to write data outside the designated memory region allocated for the buffer. This can lead to corruption of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could allow the attacker to gain control of the system running the vulnerable software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted IFC file: The attacker creates a specially designed IFC file that contains the data necessary to trigger the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- User interaction required: The user must open the malicious IFC file using an affected version of Bentley MicroStation or a MicroStation-based application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious IFC file and make it available to the target user.
- The attacker must rely on user interaction (opening the file).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is also referenced as ZDI-22-605 and ZDI-CAN-16332.
- The severity of this issue is rated as 7.8 (High) by the CVSS v3.1 calculator.
- Bentley recommends updating to the latest versions of MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications to mitigate this issue.
- It is also recommended to open IFC files only from trusted sources.
