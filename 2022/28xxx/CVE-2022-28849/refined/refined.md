- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free (UAF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Adobe Bridge.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a user interact with a maliciously crafted file. User interaction is required (UI:R). The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N).
