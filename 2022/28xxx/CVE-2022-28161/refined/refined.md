Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An information exposure vulnerability exists due to sensitive information (like SSH passwords) being written to the `filetransfer.log` file when debug mode is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure logging practices. The system logs sensitive data in plain text to a log file that can be accessed by a local user.
- Debug mode logs are not properly secured.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with valid user credentials could gain access to sensitive information, such as SSH passwords, which could allow them to further compromise the system or other systems that use those credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must have valid user credentials for the Brocade SANnav system.
- The attacker must enable debug mode to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid user credentials to login to the Brocade SANnav system.
- The attacker must have the ability to enable debug mode.
- The attacker needs local access to the system to read log files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Brocade SANnav versions before 2.2.0.
- The issue was discovered during a penetration test.
- The CVSS score is 5.0 which is rated as a medium severity.
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), low attack complexity (AC:L), low privilege user (PR:L), requires user interaction (UI:R) and there is no change in scope (S:U), high confidentiality impact (C:H), no impact on integrity (I:N) or availability (A:N).
