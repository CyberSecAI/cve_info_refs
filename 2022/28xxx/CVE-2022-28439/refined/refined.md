- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `userid` parameter within the `/BabyCare/admin.php` script before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application, leading to potential unauthorized data access, data modification, or complete database compromise. As shown in the provided payload examples, an attacker could potentially extract data, inject data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests to the `/BabyCare/admin.php` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `userid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, meaning they can be remote or local, as long as they can access the application.
