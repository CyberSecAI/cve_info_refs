Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The F-Secure Internet Security Browser for Android does not fully display the URL in the address bar. This incomplete display can be exploited by a malicious website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The browser's inability to show the full URL, including elements like the port number, allows a malicious website to create a spoofed URL. This can trick users into believing they are visiting a legitimate site when they are actually on a malicious one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to conduct phishing attacks. By crafting malicious websites with spoofed URLs, attackers can deceive users into entering sensitive information such as login credentials, banking details etc., on what appears to be a trusted site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attack vector is a maliciously crafted website designed to exploit the incomplete URL display.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to host or control a website with a maliciously crafted URL, designed to look like a legitimate URL when rendered by the vulnerable browser. The attacker would then have to trick the user into visiting the malicious webpage.
