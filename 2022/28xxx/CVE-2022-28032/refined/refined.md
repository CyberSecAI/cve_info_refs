- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `admin/ajax/pages.php` file in Atom.CMS is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input being directly used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting database data, including user information. With sufficient privileges, they could also delete tables or drop the entire database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the GET request to `admin/ajax/pages.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This likely requires being able to access the administration interface.
