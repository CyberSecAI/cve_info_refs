Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **lack of authentication** in the AssetView server's communication module. This allows unauthorized access to critical functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication for Critical Functions (CWE-306):** The server communication module lacks proper authentication mechanisms, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send crafted communication to the server. This can lead to the server instructing managed clients to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.
*   **Compromised Client Machines:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to take control of client machines by executing malicious code with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attacker leverages the network to send crafted communications to the server.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker does not need local access to the server; they can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the AssetView server.
*   **Knowledge of System Configuration:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the system configuration to craft malicious communications that will be interpreted by the server as legitimate commands.
*   **Ability to craft malicious configuration files:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious configuration that can be uploaded to the server.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** AssetView versions prior to 13.2.0 are vulnerable. Versions prior to 11.0.0 are no longer supported, and will not receive patches.
*   **Mitigation:** A patch (Hotfix) has been released by the vendor which addresses the vulnerability. It also includes guidance to enforce SSL for better security.
*   **CVSS Metrics:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.0 and a CVSS v2 base score of 9.3, indicating a critical severity.
