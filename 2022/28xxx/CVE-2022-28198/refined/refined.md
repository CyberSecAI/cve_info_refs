- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the configuration of OpenSSL within NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus and Cache.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper configuration of OpenSSL leads to a vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, which can impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have physical access to the system. The attacker must also have user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
