```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Proxmox Plugin disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM when configured to ignore SSL/TLS issues.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper SSL/TLS certificate validation.

Impact of exploitation:
- Disabling SSL/TLS certificate validation makes the Jenkins controller vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by allowing insecure connections, where attackers can intercept and modify communication between Jenkins and other servers.

Attack vectors:
- Network-based attack: An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by intercepting the network traffic between the Jenkins controller and other servers due to the disabled SSL/TLS validation.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins controller and other servers.
- No specific user interaction is required for successful exploitation.
