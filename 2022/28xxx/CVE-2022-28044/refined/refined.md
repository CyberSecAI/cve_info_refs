Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28044:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a double free or heap corruption issue in the `lrzip` compression program. The `suffix` field within the `rzip_control` structure is sometimes initialized to point to a global read-only memory location (e.g., ".lrz" in `initialize_control`), while at other times it could point to user-supplied memory (via `optarg`). This same field is then treated as a heap-allocated variable when the `rzip_control` structure is freed or when setting a new suffix. This leads to `dealloc` (free) being called on memory that was not allocated via `alloc` (malloc, etc) or already freed causing a double free scenario.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect memory management:** The `suffix` field within the `rzip_control` struct was not consistently allocated with `alloc` and was sometimes assigned to global read-only memory or user supplied memory, and then later freed with `dealloc` as if it was allocated with `alloc`.
*   **Double Free:** Freeing memory that was not heap allocated, or already freed.
*   **Heap Corruption:** Attempting to `free` memory not allocated with `alloc`, can corrupt the heap metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap corruption:** This can lead to a crash or exploitable memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the heap corruption is controlled, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** Crashes can cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered when freeing the `rzip_control` structure.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered when setting a new suffix, especially when the suffix is user-supplied via command-line arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to run the `lrzip` program.
*   The attacker needs to be able to specify command-line arguments to `lrzip`, specifically the suffix.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

  - The vulnerable code snippets and files
  - The exact locations where the incorrect deallocation was happening
  - The steps taken to fix the issue
  - Discussions around the vulnerability, and its fix, including that it was present for many years.

**Fix:**
The fix involved using `strdup` to create a heap-allocated copy of the suffix string, both when initializing to the default value ".lrz" and when setting a new suffix via command line option, and removing the extraneous call to `dealloc` in the case when the suffix is being overwritten. This ensures that the memory is allocated on the heap, and can be freed safely with `dealloc`.
