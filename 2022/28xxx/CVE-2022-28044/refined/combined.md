| Good grief! This has been around since v0.1 and rzip before, even before I became involved (v0.19). The initialise function should be used for setting constants or like-size variables, like compression level, etc. Setting control->suffix to equal `optarg` is probably a mistake if there will be recursion. I think the dealloc of suffix is incorrect too. It does not need to be. HOWEVER, the ability to pipe input to `lrzip` sort of makes recursion obsolete and unnecessary. strdup will work and I'll see about implementing it in `lrzip-next`. Thank you |
