Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `dir` parameter in the `sadmin_fileedit` action of the UCMS 1.6 application. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths for reading.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is an arbitrary file reading vulnerability. The application fails to restrict the file paths that can be accessed through the `dir` parameter, which leads to an insecure direct object reference.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read the contents of any file accessible to the webserver by manipulating the `dir` parameter, potentially exposing sensitive information. In the example given, the attacker was able to read the contents of `1.txt`. This could lead to exposure of configuration files, source code, database credentials, or other private data.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file with the `do=sadmin_fileedit` parameter and a manipulated `dir` parameter. The `file` parameter is also part of the URL which specifies the filename.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable UCMS application.
    *   The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable URL and parameters.
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to use `sadmin_fileedit`. From the given request example, the attacker needs cookies set such as `admin_adc3f8` and `psw_adc3f8`.
