Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-28699:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in the BIOS firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the BIOS firmware.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to escalation of privilege.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user with local access to the system.
- The attacker is required to have access to the system with high privileges, which is indicated by "PR:H" in the CVSS vector.
