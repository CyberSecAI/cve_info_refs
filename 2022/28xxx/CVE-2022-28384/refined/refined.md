{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Verbatim Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD and Verbatim Keypad Secure USB drives use an insecure design that allows for offline brute-force attacks against the passcode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation (CWE-1240)",
	  "AES-256 in ECB mode is used for data encryption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can find out the correct passcode and gain unauthorized access to the stored encrypted data.",
    "attack_vectors": "Offline brute-force attack by generating and observing the derived AES keys (KEK) of the keypad for all possible passcodes, then decrypting a specific SSD sector and checking for a known byte pattern.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs physical access to the device and the ability to generate and observe the derived AES keys and try to decrypt specific sectors."
