Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-28284:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in how Firefox's SVG `<use>` element handles external references, specifically when loading content from the same origin.  Unlike other browsers (Chrome and Safari), Firefox was allowing the `<use>` element to load and execute script from an `<iframe>` within a referenced SVG, even when the SVG was loaded from the same origin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unexpected Script Execution:** Firefox was executing scripts within iframes loaded via SVG `<use>` elements, whereas other browsers were not, creating an inconsistency and a security risk.
*   **Bypassing Sandboxing:** The ability to execute script via a `<use>` element referencing a same-origin SVG with an `<iframe>` allowed attackers to bypass sandboxing mechanisms, gaining access to the raw document and potentially sensitive data like cookies.
*   **Inconsistent Implementation:** The behavior was inconsistent with other browsers which blocked loading iframes within SVG's use elements
*   **Ambiguous SVG Spec:** The SVG2 specification's handling of `<foreignObject>` and `<iframe>` within `<use>` elements is not explicitly defined. It's unclear if iframes should be allowed and if they should have a script execution context, leading to different interpretations and implementations among browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious scripts through an SVG file loaded with `<use>`, an attacker can gain access to a user's cookies and other sensitive information associated with the website.
*  **Bypassing Sandbox:** The vulnerability allows bypassing sandbox framework giving access to the raw document.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Once an attacker can execute script, they could potentially exfiltrate sensitive data to an external site.
*   **Manipulation of the DOM:** The attacker could also manipulate the page's DOM, potentially changing the content of the page, or redirecting the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SVG File:** The attacker crafts a malicious SVG file that includes an `<iframe>` element with a `srcdoc` attribute, which in turn loads and executes a malicious script.
*   **Use Element:** The attacker uses the `<use>` element within a webpage to reference the malicious SVG file.
* **Same-origin Restriction Bypass:**  Although same-origin is required, an attacker can upload a malicious SVG file to the same origin as the target site and then reference it with a use tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to upload SVG files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload a malicious SVG file to the same origin as the target website, or the attacker controls the target website in order to insert a malicious SVG file on the same origin as the website.
*   **Ability to use the <use> tag:** The attacker needs to be able to insert the use tag on the target website.

**Additional Notes**
The vulnerability was addressed by restricting content loadable via cross-document `<use>` elements to SVG graphics elements, aligning with the SVG 1.1 standard, instead of allowing any valid SVG document subtree which is what SVG 2 suggests.
The fix was implemented in Firefox 99.
The bug report notes that there were regressions from this fix.
The bug report also notes this vulnerability contributes to sec-high website vulnerabilities.
