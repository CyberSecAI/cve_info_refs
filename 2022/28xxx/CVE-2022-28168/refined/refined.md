Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-28168:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of Base64 encoding to store `scp-server` passwords in Brocade SANnav. This encoding method is easily reversible, leading to exposure of the passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure storage of passwords. Instead of proper encryption or hashing, passwords are only encoded with Base64, which is a reversible encoding scheme.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to log files containing the Base64 encoded passwords can easily decode them, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the `scp-server`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to log files where encoded `scp-server` passwords are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the system's log files. This could be achieved via local access to the system or through other vulnerabilities that enable log access.

**Affected Products:**
- Brocade SAN Navigator (SANnav) versions prior to v2.2.0.2 and v2.1.1.8.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Brocade SANnav version 2.2.0.2, 2.1.1.8, or later.
