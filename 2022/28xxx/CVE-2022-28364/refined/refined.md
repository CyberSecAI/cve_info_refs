  "content": "The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Reprise License Manager 14.2, including CVE-2022-28364.\n\n**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2022-28364:**\n\n*   **Product:** RLM 14.2\n*   **Vendor:** Reprise Software\n*   **Vulnerability Title:** Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\n*  **Severity:** Low\n*   **Root Cause:** A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `/goform/rlmswitchr_process` endpoint, specifically the `file` parameter when accessed via a GET request.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input when reflecting it back in a page.\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser session. If the user has administrative privileges, this could result in a more impactful compromise, including the ability to modify data or perform actions on the user's behalf. Since this is an authenticated vulnerability, the attacker will need to be logged in as an authorized user to inject the code.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted GET request to `/goform/rlmswitchr_process` with malicious JavaScript injected into the `file` parameter.  This requires the victim user to access the malicious link.\n*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to the application."
