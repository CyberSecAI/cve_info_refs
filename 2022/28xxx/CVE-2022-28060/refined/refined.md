**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in the `/CMSsite/includes/login.php` file, specifically through the `user_name` parameter. The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize user inputs when constructing SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `user_name` parameter of the login form.
