Hash: SHA512
Advisory ID: SYSS-2022-014
Product: Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive
Manufacturer: Verbatim
Affected Version(s): #53650
Tested Version(s): #53650
Vulnerability Type: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky
Implementation (CWE-1240)
Risk Level: High
Solution Status: Open
Manufacturer Notification: 2022-02-03
Solution Date: -
Public Disclosure: 2022-06-08
CVE Reference: CVE-2022-28387
Author of Advisory: Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
The Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive is a USB drive with
AES 256-bit hardware encryption and a built-in fingerprint sensor for
unlocking the device with previously registered fingerprints.
The manufacturer describes the product as follows:
"The AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption seamlessly encrypts all data on the
drive in real-time. The drive is compliant with GDPR requirements as
100% of the drive is securely encrypted. The built-in fingerprint
recognition system allows access for up to eight authorised users and
one administrator who can access the device via a password. The hard
drive does not store passwords in the computer or system's volatile
memory making it far more secure than software encryption."[1]
Due to an insecure design, the Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard
Drive can be unlocked by an attacker who can thus gain unauthorized
access to the stored data.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
When analyzing the Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive,
Matthias Deeg found out it uses an insecure design which allows
retrieving the currently used password and thus the ability to unlock
and access the stored data in an unauthorized way.
The Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive consists of the
following five main parts:
1. A hard drive (3.5 inch)
2. A USB-to-SATA bridge controller (INIC-3637EN)
3. An SPI flash memory chip (XT25F01B) containing the firmware of the
INIC-3637EN
4. A fingerprint sensor
5. A fingerprint sensor controller (INIC-3782N)
For encrypting the data stored on the hard drive, the hardware AES
engine of the INIC-3637EN is used. More specifically, AES-256 in ECB
(Electronic Codebook) mode is used for data encryption, which is also a
security issue by itself, as described in the SySS security advisory
SYSS-2022-015[2].
The hard drive can be either unlocked via the fingerprint sensor using a
previously registered fingerprint or via a password.
Unlocking the hard drive via a password takes place using a Windows or
macOS client software that sends specific IOCTL commands
(IOCTL\_SCSI\_PASS\_THROUGH) to the USB device.
The data part of those device-specific commands is encrypted using AES
with a hard-coded cryptographic key found within the client software
and the USB-to-SATA bridge controller's firmware.
One of the supported commands is able to retrieve the currently set
password and cryptographic key material used for the data disk
encryption.
By sending this specific IOCTL command to the USB device and knowing the
used AES encryption scheme for the command data, an attacker can
instantly retrieve the correct password and thus unlock the device in
order to gain unauthorized access to its stored data.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
For demonstrating the described security vulnerability, Matthias Deeg
developed a software tool that can extract the currently set password
of a Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive. This enables an
attacker to instantly unlock the device.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution:
SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for the described security issue.

Public Disclosure:         2022-06-08
CVE Reference:             CVE-2022-28387
Author of Advisory:        Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive is a USB drive with
AES 256-bit hardware encryption and a built-in fingerprint sensor for
unlocking the device with previously registered fingerprints.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"The AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption seamlessly encrypts all data on the
drive in real-time. The drive is compliant with GDPR requirements as
100% of the drive is securely encrypted. The built-in fingerprint
recognition system allows access for up to eight authorised users and
one administrator who can access the device via a password. The hard
drive does not store passwords in the computer or system's volatile
memory making it far more secure than software encryption."[1]

Due to an insecure design, the Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard
Drive can be unlocked by an attacker who can thus gain unauthorized
access to the stored data.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

When analyzing the Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive,
Matthias Deeg found out it uses an insecure design which allows
retrieving the currently used password and thus the ability to unlock
and access the stored data in an unauthorized way.

The Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive consists of the
following five main parts:

1. A hard drive (3.5 inch)
2. A USB-to-SATA bridge controller (INIC-3637EN)
3. An SPI flash memory chip (XT25F01B) containing the firmware of the
   INIC-3637EN
4. A fingerprint sensor
5. A fingerprint sensor controller (INIC-3782N)

For encrypting the data stored on the hard drive, the hardware AES
engine of the INIC-3637EN is used. More specifically, AES-256 in ECB
(Electronic Codebook) mode is used for data encryption, which is also a
security issue by itself, as described in the SySS security advisory
SYSS-2022-015[2].

The hard drive can be either unlocked via the fingerprint sensor using a
previously registered fingerprint or via a password.

Unlocking the hard drive via a password takes place using a Windows or
macOS client software that sends specific IOCTL commands
(IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH) to the USB device.

The data part of those device-specific commands is encrypted using AES
with a hard-coded cryptographic key found within the client software
and the USB-to-SATA bridge controller's firmware.

One of the supported commands is able to retrieve the currently set
password and cryptographic key material used for the data disk
encryption.

By sending this specific IOCTL command to the USB device and knowing the
used AES encryption scheme for the command data, an attacker can
instantly retrieve the correct password and thus unlock the device in
order to gain unauthorized access to its stored data.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

For demonstrating the described security vulnerability, Matthias Deeg
developed a software tool that can extract the currently set password
of a Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive. This enables an
attacker to instantly unlock the device.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for the described security issue.
