The provided content relates to CVE-2022-28985.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient input validation in the `addNewPost` API of the "Buzz" module in OrangeHRM. Specifically, the API does not properly validate the `createPost[linkTitle]` and `createPost[linkAddress]` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Buzz" feed.
- When a victim user visits the "Buzz" page, the malicious JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser.
- The attacker can potentially steal CSRF tokens, perform arbitrary actions on the website on behalf of the victim user, or conduct other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the `/symfony/web/index.php/buzz/addNewPost` endpoint.
- The malicious request includes a CSRF token, a valid user session cookie, and the malicious payload in the `createPost[linkTitle]` and `createPost[linkAddress]` parameters.
- When a user views the crafted post, the malicious javascript is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OrangeHRM system.
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid CSRF token.
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid user session cookie.
