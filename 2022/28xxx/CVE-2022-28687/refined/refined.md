Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an **Uncontrolled Search Path Element** vulnerability. Specifically, AVEVA Edge loads a library from an unsecured location when handling APP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The software is vulnerable to **CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element**. This means that the application does not properly validate the locations from which it loads libraries/DLLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by placing a malicious DLL in a location where AVEVA Edge will load it.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can escalate privileges to the level of the AVEVA Edge process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have access to the file system to place the malicious DLL.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. The user must either open a malicious APP file or visit a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to write files to the file system accessible to the AVEVA Edge application.
- The attacker also needs to trick the user into opening a malicious APP file or visiting a malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in AVEVA Edge (formerly known as InduSoft Web Studio).
- The vulnerability is fixed in AVEVA Edge HF 2020.2.00.40.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Pedro Ribeiro and Radek Domanski from Flashback Team.
- The ZDI advisory mentions the target must "visit a malicious page or open a malicious file", while the AVEVA bulletin mentions "a malicious entity with access to the file system". It's possible this vulnerability can be exploited with a crafted APP file without file system access to the server, or through other means.
