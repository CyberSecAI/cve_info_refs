Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Continuous Integration with Toad Edge Plugin uses a patched fork of an old version of the file browser (`DirectoryBrowserSupport`) from Jenkins core to serve reports. This fork lacks the fix for SECURITY-2481, which addressed a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows attackers to traverse directories and access files outside the intended scope on Windows controllers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read the contents of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the file browser when serving reports.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Item/Read Permission:** An attacker must have Item/Read permission in Jenkins to access the file browser and exploit the vulnerability.
- The Jenkins controller must be running on a Windows operating system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The patched fork of the file browser in the plugin did not receive the fix implemented in Jenkins core to prevent path traversal.
- The vulnerability is only exploitable on Jenkins controllers running on Windows due to the nature of the path traversal.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to update the plugin to version 2.4, which uses the built-in Jenkins file browser.
