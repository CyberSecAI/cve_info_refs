| [@zvory](https://github.com/zvory) Can we claim [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) for this? i.e. Older version was not secured properly to filtrate enough characters against CSV Injection so was not fully securing and thus could be a cause of vulnerability in applications using older versions of csv-safe gem.  Steps needs to be done could be simply putting it in the Security advisory of your repository and adding details on why the newer version was created. |

| [@danishtariqq](https://github.com/danishtariqq) Oh sorry I meant for the CVE. I assumed that went into the repo. If it doesn't, feel free to make one! Sounds like a good idea. |

# csv-safe

[![Gem Version](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b93879c9983f0de78ec3f629829dfcf9353c4d77ec08834a4b8015caaf803c1f/68747470733a2f2f62616467652e667572792e696f2f72622f6373762d736166652e737667)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/csv-safe)

Also hosted on [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/csv-safe).

This gem decorates the built in CSV library to prevent CSV injection attacks. Wherever you would use `CSV` in your code, use `CSVSafe`. The gem will encode your fields in UTF-8.

What this gem does specifically:

* Override `CSV#<<` to sanitize incoming rows.
* Override `CSV#initialize` to add a converter that will sanitize fields being read.

A description of CSV injection attacks on [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection)

Made while working at [Influitive](https://influitive.com/). We kept writing similar code to sanitize CSV output, and I couldn't find a gem to do this for us, so I wrote this.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'csv-safe'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle

```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install csv-safe

```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `csv-safe.gemspec`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
