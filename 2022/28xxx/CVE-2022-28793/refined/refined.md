Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28793:

**CVE-2022-28793**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper state maintenance in Strong Box.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability lies in the way Strong Box maintains its state. Specifically, when the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is compromised, the attacker can manipulate the Android Root of Trust (ROT) during the device boot cycle.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** If the TEE is compromised, an attacker can change the Android ROT after the device first initializes during the boot process. This can have a severe impact on the device's security, as the ROT is a foundational security mechanism.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is compromising the TEE, which is a secure area of the device's processor.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to compromise and control the TEE to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The patch is specifically applied in the Galaxy S22 to prevent the change of Android ROT after the first initialization at boot time.
*   The content identifies the researchers who reported this vulnerability: Federico Menarini and Martijn Bogaard of Riscure.
