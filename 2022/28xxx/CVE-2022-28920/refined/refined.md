Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of `strip_tags` function on user-provided input (`$_GET['plug']`) in `templates/control.php` at line 53. `strip_tags` is insufficient to prevent XSS as it does not sanitize Javascript URLs. Specifically, the code extracts a plugin name from the query string, retrieves plugin information, and then echoes the plugin URL within an `<a>` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The use of `strip_tags` is inadequate to sanitize user input, specifically javascript URLs, which allows for injection of malicious code through the `plug` parameter. The code then uses this unsanitized input when constructing the URL within the `<a>` tag.
- Inadequate Input Sanitization: The code fails to properly sanitize or validate the `plug` parameter before using it to construct a URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the link by crafting a URL with a `javascript:` scheme, which is then executed when a user clicks on the link, resulting in client side execution of malicious script within the user's browser session, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- The severity is "Moderate" due to the requirement of admin privileges, thus limiting the impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by crafting a malicious URL.
- The attack vector involves a crafted GET request with a malicious `plug` parameter, which is then processed by the vulnerable script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator access:** The attacker must be an administrator to access the vulnerable code path.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the javascript payload.
- No additional capabilities are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in `Tieba-Cloud-Sign v4.9`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by pull request #173.
- The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2022-28920.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.8, considered moderate severity.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
