# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### **[enferas](/enferas)** commented [Apr 6, 2022](#issue-1194528586)

| Hello,  I would like to report for XSS vulnerability.  In file <https://github.com/MoeNetwork/Tieba-Cloud-Sign/blob/master/templates/control.php> line 53.  ``` case 'setplug':   $plug = strip_tags($_GET['plug']);   $pluginfo = getPluginInfo($plug); ```  Then, there is an echo in line 62.  ``` echo '<a href="'.$pluginfo['plugin']['url'].'" target="_blank">'; ```  strip\_tags is not secure in this case. If you can look to this code example the alert will be printed when you press on the link.  ``` <?php $x = "'javascript:alert()'"; $y = strip_tags($x); echo "<a href=$x>ClickMe</a>"; ``` |
