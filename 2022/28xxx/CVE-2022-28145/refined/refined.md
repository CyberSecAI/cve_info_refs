Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28145:

**CVE-2022-28145**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Continuous Integration with Toad Edge Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 2.3 and earlier
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin uses a patched fork of an old version of the file browser (`DirectoryBrowserSupport`) from Jenkins core to serve reports. This patched fork removes the `Content-Security-Policy` header functionality that was introduced to prevent XSS.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of the `Content-Security-Policy` header allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser when they view reports served by this plugin. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Other malicious actions
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with `Item/Configure` permission can craft malicious report contents.
    *   An attacker who can control the content of reports can inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs `Item/Configure` permission within Jenkins or the ability to influence report contents.
* **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Continuous Integration with Toad Edge Plugin version 2.4 or later. Version 2.4 uses the built-in Jenkins file browser, which includes the fix for the missing `Content-Security-Policy` header.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin using a custom file browser that does not properly implement security measures (specifically the `Content-Security-Policy` header), leading to an XSS vulnerability. This allows attackers with the ability to configure jobs or modify the report contents to inject and execute malicious javascript code when a victim views the report.
