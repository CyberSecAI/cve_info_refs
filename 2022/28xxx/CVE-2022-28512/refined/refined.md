Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `single.php` file, specifically when handling the `id` parameter. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This may result in:
    - **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive information from the database.
    - **Data Modification:** Altering or deleting data within the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining administrative privileges depending on database permissions.
- **Application Disruption:** Causing denial-of-service by injecting queries that make the application unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `single.php` file with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable file is `single.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The provided example payload is: `id=' union select 1,database(),3,user(),5,6,7,8,9--+-`
- This payload is a UNION based SQL injection designed to extract information from the database such as the database name and user.
