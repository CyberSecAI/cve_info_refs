- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free in the Virtual GPU Manager (`nvidia.ko`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. An attacker needs to control freeing some host side resources out of sequence.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have elevated privileges to control the freeing of host resources out of sequence. It is also noted that this attack is complex to carry out.
