- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WiJungle Next Generation Firewall U250 does not implement rate limiting on the login page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of rate limiting on the login page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can brute-force admin credentials by sending a large number of login attempts with different username/password combinations.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending HTTP requests to the login page of the WiJungle Next Generation Firewall U250.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the login page. They also need to be able to capture and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).
