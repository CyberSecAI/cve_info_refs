The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Railway Reservation System v1.0 by oretnom23.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/orrs/admin/inquiries/view_details.php` file, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive database information, and possibly gain complete control of the database server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/orrs/admin/inquiries/view_details.php` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

The provided payload `id=-1' union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7--+` demonstrates how to extract database information using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
