The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Railway Reservation System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `delete_reservation` function within the `Master.php` file. Specifically the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-provided input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database including the database name, as demonstrated by the provided payload `id=8' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/orrs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_reservation` with the malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability as the page `admin/?page=reservations` is accessible without authentication.
