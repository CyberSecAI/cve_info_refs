Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The "Matomo Integration" extension for TYPO3 CMS fails to properly encode user input provided by PSR-14 Event Listeners before outputting it in an HTML context. This lack of proper encoding allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the improper handling of user-controlled input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by users of the affected TYPO3 instance. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via user input processed by PSR-14 event listeners that is then rendered in an HTML context.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code within the context of PSR-14 Event Listeners. The attacker does not need to have privileged access to the TYPO3 system for the execution of the attack.
