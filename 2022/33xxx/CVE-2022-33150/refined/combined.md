# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1577

## Robustel R1510 js\_package install OS command injection vulnerability

##### October 14, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-33150

##### SUMMARY

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the js\_package install functionality of Robustel R1510 3.1.16. A specially-crafted network request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Robustel R1510 3.1.16

##### PRODUCT URLS

R1510 - <https://www.robustel.com/en/product/r1510-industrial-cellular-vpn-router/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The R1510 is an industrial cellular router. It offers several advanced software features like an innovative use of Open VPN, Cloud management, data over-use guard, smart reboot and others.

The R1510’s web\_server provides a functionality to add Nodejs app. This functionality is a three step process.
First the `/action/import_nodejs_app/` API is used to actually import the Nodejs app into the router. Then the `/ajax/system_nodejs_app_upgrade_start/` API is used to start the installation process. Indeed, this API will finally call the `js_package` package binary with the command `install`.

Here is the relevant code of the `/action/import_nodejs_app/` API:

```
void /action/import_nodejs_app/(Webs *webs)
{
  [...]
        next_file = (WebsKey *)hashFirst(webs->files);
        pcVar5 = file_path;
        for (; next_file != (WebsKey *)0x0; next_file = (WebsKey *)hashNext(webs->files,next_file))
        {
          WebsUpload = (next_file->content).WebsUpload;
          [...]
          file_path = (char *)sfmt("%s/%s","/tmp/upload",WebsUpload->clientFilename);
          pcVar3 = (char *)rename(WebsUpload->filename,file_path);
          if (pcVar3 == (char *)0xffffffff) {
            [...]
          }
          else {
            FILENAME = string_clone(file_path);
          }
        }
      }
      [...]

```

This function will import the request’s uploaded file and set the global `FILENAME` variable with the value `/tmp/upload/<WebsUpload->clientFilename>` where `WebsUpload->clientFilename` is the filename provided in the multipart request.

To start the installation process of the uploaded app, the `/ajax/system_nodejs_app_upgrade_start/` API must be called.

Here is the relevant part of the `/ajax/system_nodejs_app_upgrade_start/` API:

```
undefined4 /ajax/system_nodejs_app_upgrade_start/(Webs *webs)
{
  [...]
  command_array[0] = "js_package";
  command_array[1] = "install";
  command_array[2] = FILENAME;
  command_array[3] = (char *)0x0;
  _eval(command_array,0,0,&pid);
  [...]
}

```

This function, eventually, will execute the `js_package install <FILENAME>` command. The `js_package` binary is responsible for actually performing the installation.

The `js_package` code:

```
int js_package(int argc,undefined4 *argv)
{
  [...]
  command = (char *)argv[1];
  is_install = strncmp(command,"install",7);
  if (is_install == 0) {
    [...]
    filename = (char *)argv[2];
    extension = strrchr(filename,L'.');
    if (extension == (char *)0x0) {
        [...]
    }
    else {
      extension_after_dot = extension + 1;
      [...]
      is_extension_tar = strncmp(extension_after_dot,"tar",3);
      if (is_extension_tar == 0) {
        command = "tar xf %s -C %s";
        [...]
        sysprintf(command,filename,"/app/node-js-app/tmp");                                             [1]
        [...]
}

```

This function, if the `FILENAME` ends with `.tar`, will perform the `sysprintf` function. This function will execute the `vsnprintf` function with the provided arguments, then use the output as argument for the `system` function. So, at `[1]`, the command `tar xf <FILENAME> -C /app/node-js-app/tmp` will be executed. Because `filename` is the same `FILENAME` specified in `/action/import_nodejs_app/`, this function is vulnerable to a command injection.
