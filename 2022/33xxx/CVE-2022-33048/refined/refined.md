Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/orrs/admin/reservations/view_details.php` file of the Online Railway Reservation System v1.0. This is due to unsanitized input being directly used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can use SQL injection techniques to extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the ability to determine the database name.
*   **Potential for complete compromise:** It is likely that an attacker could perform more advanced exploitation by writing data or calling stored procedures, potentially leading to complete compromise of the database and application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the ability to craft SQL queries to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The specific vulnerable file is: `/orrs/admin/reservations/view_details.php`
*   The vulnerable parameter is: `id`
*   The provided example demonstrates how to leak the database name using `length(database())`.
*   The admin credentials are also provided, which could further aid an attacker if they don't have them initially: admin/admin123.
