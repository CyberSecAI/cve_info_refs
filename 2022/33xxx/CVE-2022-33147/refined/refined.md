Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause of CVE-2022-33147 is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically SQL injection vulnerabilities, within the `ObjectYPT` class of the WWBN AVideo platform. This class provides an abstraction for database interactions but fails to sanitize user-supplied inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection in the `ObjectYPT::save` method. This occurs because user-provided data is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `duration`, `videoDownloadedLink` parameters in the `aVideoEncoder` object, `title` and `description` fields in the `Live Schedules` object, and the `url` parameter in the `CloneSite` plugin object are all vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database compromise:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to:
    - Dump the entire database, including password hashes of all users.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Remote Code Execution (Chained):** Although direct code execution isn't possible through the SQL injection due to default database configurations, chaining with other vulnerabilities is possible. After obtaining user password hashes, an attacker can log in as an administrator, and then upload plugins which leads to arbitrary command execution on the server.
- **Information Disclosure:** Extracting the admin's password hash allows for full access to the system's administrative features.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints.
  - For `aVideoEncoder`: sending a POST request to `objects/aVideoEncoder.json.php` with malicious `duration` and/or `videoDownloadedLink` parameters.
  - For `Live Schedules`: sending a POST request to `plugin/Live/view/Live_schedule/add.json.php` with malicious `title` and `description` parameters.
   - For `CloneSite`: sending a GET request to `plugin/CloneSite/cloneServer.json.php` with a malicious `url` parameter.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The lack of sanitization in the `ObjectYPT::save` method is the primary vector for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication (Partial):** For `aVideoEncoder` and `Live Schedules`, a user with permission to upload videos or stream videos is needed to exploit. However, the `CloneSite` vulnerability is unauthenticated.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know which parameters are vulnerable and how to inject SQL.

**Additional Information:**

- The report details multiple injection points across the application and their respective exploitation methods.
- The report provides specific Proof of Concept (PoC) examples for each vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in WWBN AVideo version 11.6 and the dev master commit 3f7c0364.
- The vendor has confirmed the issue and released a patch on July 7th, 2022.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Claudio Bozzato of Cisco Talos.
- The provided github commit `e04b1cd7062e16564157a82bae389eedd39fa088` includes the fix for this vulnerability, stating  "All our classes were updated using the prepared statement to avoid SQL injection-- also `videoDownloadedLink` and `duration` are now sanitized-- if you are editing anything we now "forbidIfItIsNotMyUsersId"-- key and URL are now sanitized Clone plugin".

This report provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description, including specific vulnerable parameters, example exploits, and the impact of successful exploitation.
