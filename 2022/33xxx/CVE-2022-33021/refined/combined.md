| Hi,  CVA6 RTL is returning unknown value ("xxxxxxxx") when reading the value of MHPMCOUNTER30. This is happening because the csr reg data (`csr_rdata`) is being read from `perf_counter_d` array in the perf\_counters.sv module with an array index outside its range. The range of `perf_counter_d` is [riscv::CSR\_MIF\_EMPTY : riscv::CSR\_ML1\_ICACHE\_MISS] (line:46 from perf\_counter.sv file), but in line: 282 of csv\_regfile.sv we are using the array to access array index riscv::CSR\_MHPM\_COUNTER\_30, which is greater than the range of [riscv::CSR\_MIF\_EMPTY : riscv::CSR\_ML1\_ICACHE\_MISS].  Please find attached the triggering input mem file, spike\_trace\_log, and cva6\_trace\_log. We can see from the line:83 of cva6 trace log that the read data is `xxxxxxxx` [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79608200/170143824-8a519bdf-ccc3-4126-9a81-790e50020b83.png)  [outofrange.zip](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/8766647/outofrange.zip) |

| Hi [@JeanRochCoulon](https://github.com/JeanRochCoulon) and [@yanicasa](https://github.com/yanicasa) , this issue is more than 7 months old and has not received any updates. It looks like an important issue to me. It could be that this issue has been already resolved with the latest updates to the Tracer. |

| Hello [@TulikaSi](https://github.com/TulikaSi) This GitHub issue is related to perf counters. As you are modifying the perf counters, maybe the bug will be naturally removed. If it is not the case, can you fix it. |

| Hello [@TulikaSi](https://github.com/TulikaSi) This GitHub issue is related to perf counters. As you are modifying the perf counters, maybe the bug will be naturally removed. If it is not the case, can you fix it.  Hi [@JeanRochCoulon](https://github.com/JeanRochCoulon) the hardware performance monitor includes 29 number of 64-bit event counters, mhpmcounter3– mhpmcounter31 but in accordance to the requirement specification [https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/docs/02\_cva6\_requirements/cva6\_requirements\_specification.rst#performance-counters](url) the implementation shall take into account only six generic 64-bit performance counters **mhpmcounter3 to mhpmcounter8** including their upper 32 bits counterparts **mhpmcounter3h to mhpmcounter8h**. So I believe after the modification of the performance counter, the RTL can be made to return read-only 0 for unimplemented counters. |

| Hi [@JeanRochCoulon](https://github.com/JeanRochCoulon) Since the performance counters have been modified, this issue now no longer exists as all the mhpmcounters have been implemented. We can close this issue. |
