- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) due to improper input validation for monitoring screen files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly validate input when loading monitoring screen files, making it vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve remote code execution by leading a user to load a monitoring screen file containing malicious XAML code.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could send a crafted malicious monitoring screen file to a victim, and if the user loads the file, the attacker will be able to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into loading a malicious monitoring screen file.
