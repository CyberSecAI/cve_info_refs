Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-33148:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries within the `ObjectYPT` class's `save` method in WWBN AVideo. Specifically, when updating or inserting data into the database, string values are directly concatenated into the SQL query without escaping or using parameterized queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection (CWE-89).  The `title` parameter in the `plugin/Live/view/Live_schedule/add.json.php` file is directly inserted into an SQL query without sanitization within the `setTitle` method and then saved by the `save` method from the `ObjectYPT` class.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, allowing them to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (password hashes).
    - Modify data in the database, potentially causing data corruption or unauthorized changes.
    - Execute arbitrary SQL commands, possibly leading to further compromise.
- In the provided example, the attacker can extract the administrator's password hash, which, combined with other vulnerabilities in the system, can lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `plugin/Live/view/Live_schedule/add.json.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. In the case of CVE-2022-33148 they must have access to the Live Streaming functionality (permission to stream videos).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also details other SQL injection vulnerabilities affecting other components of AVideo, including `aVideoEncoder`, `CloneSite` which are assigned other CVEs (CVE-2022-33147, CVE-2022-33149, and CVE-2022-34652).
- The advisory highlights a technique to chain these vulnerabilities together to achieve full system compromise by dumping the database, obtaining password hashes, and gaining administrator access. From there the attacker can upload malicious plugins and achieve command execution on the server.
- The vulnerability was addressed by the vendor on July 7th, 2022, according to the timeline in the report.
- The `updateDb.v12.0.sql` file contains comments related to the fix, however the file itself does not contain the fix, but the vulnerabilities discovered and fixed.
