Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-33146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insufficient check on the `send` parameter within the web2py application, allowing for arbitrary redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the `send` parameter, which is used for redirection, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary, potentially malicious URLs. This is a classic open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked, redirects the user to a phishing site, potentially leading to the theft of credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could use the redirect to send users to sites hosting malware, thereby infecting the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes a malicious value for the `send` parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to click on the malicious link for the redirection to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create URLs with the vulnerable parameter containing a malicious redirect target.
- **User Lure:** The attacker needs to find a way to make the user click the crafted link (e.g. via email, social media, other websites).
- **No special access:** No prior access or authentication to the web2py application is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves using the `prevent_open_redirect` function to sanitize the `send` parameter. This function checks the provided URL, preventing redirects to absolute URLs, or URLs that starts with `//`, `~/` or similar.
- The vulnerability affects web2py versions prior to 2.22.5.
- The issue was reported to IPA by Yuji Tounai of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- CVSS v3: 4.7 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)
- CVSS v2: 2.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

The CVSS scores reflect the nature of the attack vector (network), low attack complexity, no privileges required and user interaction being required. The score also shows a changed scope and a low integrity impact and no impact on confidentiality or availability.
