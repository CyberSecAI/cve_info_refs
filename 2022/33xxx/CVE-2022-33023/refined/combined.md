| Hi,  The RISC-V ISA Volume I, 20190608, page 43 mentions: "MULH[[S]U] rdh, rs1, rs2; MUL rdl, rs1, rs2 (source register specifiers must be in same order and rdh cannot be the same as rs1 or rs2)" [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79608200/170154875-91a5238a-9b8d-4fc5-8d7a-6ef193ef5f70.png)  Our testcase shows cva6 will not throw illegal instruction exception in this case while spike does at line 84. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79608200/170155008-0d8d99f5-10ef-4ecd-90a5-33209612369a.png)  The testcase mem file, rtl trace log, and spike trace log are attached. [missexcept.zip](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/8767083/missexcept.zip)  Thank you |

| [@AyoubJalali](https://github.com/AyoubJalali) Sorry, I couldn't find the .S file, but it should be easy to reproduce because the issue is only related to one instruction.  Maybe you can change the instruction from `mulhsu` to `mulhu`, such that the binary code will be 0200`3`033 but not 0200`2`033? |

| [@AyoubJalali](https://github.com/AyoubJalali) the version of spike may be the problem. I just tried the most recent version of spike: commit `a35865f0f5559d8af81920b2d832e15af6caa123` and still see the *illegal instruction exception*. Since spike is modified based on the ISA user manual, if the relevant description is still in the manual, spike will follow it. |

| [@chenc6](https://github.com/chenc6) and [@AyoubJalali](https://github.com/AyoubJalali) The RISCV specification tells us that "rdh cannot be the same as rs1 or rs2". It is not clear to me if an illegal instruction must be triggered or not. Does the RISCV or the CVA6 ISA specification tells us what is the behaviour in that case? |

| [@JeanRochCoulon](https://github.com/JeanRochCoulon) [@chenc6](https://github.com/chenc6) [@AyoubJalali](https://github.com/AyoubJalali) The CVA6 behaves correctly. There is no reason to raise an illegal instruction exception on `MULH[[S]U]` instruction.  The specification only warns the software developer when using `MULH[[S]U]` and `MUL` instructions. If `rdh` is the same as `rs1` or `rs2` for `MULH[[S]U]`, then the following `MUL` will compute a result based on a modified `rs1` or `rs2`. Therefore, in such case, the `MUL` result will not be the expected one. |

| [@JeanRochCoulon](https://github.com/JeanRochCoulon) I don't think the cva6 should raised an illegal instruction it's just a recommendation if you want the lower & upper part of the multiplication you should use a sequence mentioned in the RISCV spec. |
