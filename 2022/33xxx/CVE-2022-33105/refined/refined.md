Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-33105:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from NetApp's security advisory directly references CVE-2022-33105 and describes it as a Redis vulnerability that could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). The Gentoo Security Advisory also confirms the vulnerability is related to Redis, and the GitHub commit message references a memory leak fix related to streamGetEdgeID that was introduced in Redis 7.0. This confirms the content relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a result of a flaw in Redis version 7.0 that can be triggered by a crafted Lua script.
*   A specific memory leak in `streamGetEdgeID` within Redis was identified, introduced in a previous change for Redis 7.0. The memory leak can be triggered during XADD and XTRIM operations, and also potentially in XDEL and AOFRW, although it will likely only affect large streams.
*   The underlying cause is a failure to properly terminate the stream iterator after initialization.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause the Redis server to crash, denying service to legitimate users.
*   **Memory Leak:** Improper memory management in stream operations when handling specific configurations of the product.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can crash the Redis server, making it unavailable.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** If the memory leak is triggered successfully and left unpatched, it may lead to memory exhaustion issues over time.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (CVSS vector AV:N).
*   **Lua Script Injection**: The vulnerability is triggered by loading a crafted Lua script.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require authentication (CVSS vector PR:N).
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability does not require user interaction (CVSS vector UI:N).
*   The attacker needs the capability to load a Lua script with the malicious code to exploit the vulnerability. This could require access to the Redis server in some way, depending on how it is exposed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The NetApp advisory indicates that no NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability due to a fix implemented in Redis version 7.0.1, which addresses the root cause. The vulnerability was present in Redis 7.0 before the fix.
*   The Gentoo advisory states that upgrading to Redis version 7.0.5 resolves the issue.
* The GitHub content mentions that a memory leak fix was included in Redis 7.0.1, confirming the memory leak issue and the patch.
*   The NetApp advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating a high-impact vulnerability that can be exploited remotely.

In summary, CVE-2022-33105 is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in Redis (specifically, versions prior to 7.0.1) that can be triggered via a malicious Lua script, leading to a denial-of-service condition. A memory leak was also identified and fixed, related to stream operations. NetApp products which use Redis are not affected due to the inclusion of the fix in Redis 7.0.1 and the subsequent versions they use.
