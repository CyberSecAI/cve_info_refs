SUMMARY

SIMATIC MV500 devices before V3.3 are affected by multiple vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to
hijack other users’ web based management sessions (CVE-2022-33137) or access data on the device
without prior authentication (CVE-2022-33138).

Siemens has released an update for the SIMATIC MV500 devices and recommends to update to the latest
version. Note that the update also contains additional ﬁxes for vulnerabilities documented in Siemens
Security Advisory SSA-712929.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC MV500 products are stationary optical readers, used to reliably capture printed, lasered, drilled,
punched and dotpeen codes on a variety of different surfaces.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-33137

The web session management of affected devices does not invalidate session ids in certain logout
scenarios. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to hijack other users’ sessions.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score

CWE

8.0
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-613: Insufﬁcient Session Expiration

Vulnerability CVE-2022-33138

Affected devices do not perform authentication for several web API endpoints. This could allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to read and download data from the device.
