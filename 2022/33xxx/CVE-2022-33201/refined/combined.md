How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## FAQ

### Requirements

* Requires PHP5 and CURL.

### What is the plugin license?

* This plugin is released under a GPL license.

### What is MailerLite?

MailerLite is easy to use web-based email marketing software. It can help you create and send email newsletters, manage subscribers, track and analyze results.

### Do I need a MailerLite account to use this plugin?

Yes, you can easily register at www.mailerlite.com

### How to display a form in posts or pages?

Use shortcode with form id which you created [mailerlite\_form form\_id=1].

### How to display a form in widget areas like a sidebar?

Just add “MailerLite signup form widget” and select form you have created

### How to display a form in my template files?

Use the load\_mailerlite\_form($id) function.

```
<?php
if( function_exists( 'load_mailerlite_form' ) ) {
    load_mailerlite_form(0);
}

```

### How can I style the sign-up form?

You can use CSS rules to style the sign-up form, use the following CSS selectors to target the various form elements.

Every form can be different, because element ID of form is:

```
#mailerlite-form_(your_form_id)

```

Elements of form can be styled.

```
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-title {} /* the form title */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-description {} /* the form description */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-field label {} /* the form input label */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-field input {} /* the form inputs */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-loader {} /* the form loading text */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-subscribe-button-container {} /* the form button container */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-subscribe-button-container .mailerlite-subscribe-submit {} /* the form submit button */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-response {} /* the form response message */

```

Add your custom CSS rules to the end of your theme stylesheet, /wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/style.css. Do not add them to the plugin stylesheet as they will be automatically overwritten on the next plugin update.

The plugin does not work correctly with the new block based checkout. There are some issues regarding this from mora than 3 months with no resolution 😕

Says there are no embed forms created which is complete nonsense, because I created 3 of them.
Such a shame
There are no Embed type forms created in your account. Popup forms are shown automatically on your Wordpress site. You can switch off Popup forms in the Settings. You cannot include Landing pages in your Wordpress page
Even clicking Settings link in the error goes to a 404 Error Not Found.
Such a shame as I like the automation part….

MailerLite ist mir von Geschäftsfreund/innen aus Slowenien empfohlen worden. Die Integration in Wordpress funktioniert prima mit diesem Plugin. Fragen werden sofort vom MailerLite-Service-Team geklärt. Solch freundlichen und kompetenten -Support findet man heute kaum noch. Deshalb klare Empfehlung!

Every modern website tries now to avoid jquery, but this one needs it for form validation. Please use vanilla js. dont want to load jquery just for a signup form validation.
