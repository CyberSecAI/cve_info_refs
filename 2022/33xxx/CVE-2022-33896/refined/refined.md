- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from incorrect parsing of XML data within Hancom Office 2020 when processing .docx files. Specifically, the application mishandles the `</w:p>` XML tag when it appears without a preceding open tag `<w:p>`. This leads to a buffer underflow due to incorrect pointer arithmetic when accessing a vector-type data structure holding object pointers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Buffer underflow: The code attempts to dereference a pointer that resides before the allocated memory.
    - Incorrect pointer arithmetic: The code decrements a pointer by 4 bytes assuming there is a valid element in the vector which may not exist.
    - Use of a pointer to metadata of heap allocation (PageHeap) that's located before actual memory allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by controlling the pointer used in an indirect call. This is achieved through heap spraying techniques, where an attacker can manipulate memory content immediately before the vulnerable buffer to contain attacker-controlled data, including a crafted address pointing to malicious code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted .docx file containing a malformed `</w:p>` XML tag within the `word/document.xml` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious .docx file.
    - The victim needs to open the malicious .docx file with a vulnerable version of Hancom Office 2020.
