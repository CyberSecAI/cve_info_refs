Package        : commons-configuration2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-33980
Debian Bug     : 1014960

Apache Commons Configuration, a Java library providing a generic configuration
interface, performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be
dynamically evaluated and expanded. Starting with version 2.4 and continuing
through 2.7, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that
could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These
lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script execution
engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url" - load values from
urls, including from remote server applications using the interpolation
defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or
unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are
used.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your commons-configuration2 packages.

For the detailed security status of commons-configuration2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/commons-configuration2>

Subject: CVE-2022-33980: Apache Commons Configuration insecure
 interpolation defaults

Severity: Moderate

Description:

Apache Commons Configuration performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol.Lookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 2.4 and continuing through 2.7, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are:
- "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script)
- "dns" - resolve dns records
- "url" - load values from urls, including from remote servers

Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used.

Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons Configuration 2.8.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default.

Mitigation:

Upgrade to version Apache Commons Configuration 2.8.0

```
