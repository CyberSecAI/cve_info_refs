Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-33980:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure default settings in Apache Commons Configuration library, specifically versions 2.4 through 2.7. The library performs variable interpolation, where property values can be dynamically evaluated and expanded using the format `${prefix:name}`. The `prefix` is used to identify a `Lookup` instance for performing the interpolation. The affected versions include default `Lookup` instances that allow for:
   - Arbitrary code execution using the "script" prefix which leverages JVM's script execution engine (javax.script).
   - DNS resolution using the "dns" prefix.
   - Loading values from URLs, including remote servers using the "url" prefix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure Defaults:** The library enables "script", "dns", and "url" interpolators by default, allowing for potentially dangerous operations when processing untrusted configuration values.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The "script" interpolator allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by providing malicious configuration values.
-   **Information Disclosure/Server-Side Request Forgery:** The "url" and "dns" interpolators can be abused for unauthorized access to internal network resources and possibly retrieve sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation can lead to:
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the application using the library.
   - **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers might gain access to sensitive data through DNS queries or by fetching data from internal servers.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Loading resources from URLs could lead to denial of service.
    - **Server-side Request Forgery:** Attackers can use the vulnerable library to make requests to internal resources that the server should not normally access.

**Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector is through providing untrusted configuration values that contain malicious interpolation strings (e.g., `${script:malicious_code}`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Attackers need the ability to inject or modify configuration values processed by the vulnerable Apache Commons Configuration library. This could happen through various means depending on the application using the library. For instance, in the case of Jenkins, attackers need the ability to configure Pipelines.
-  No authentication may be required depending on the specific application that uses the library.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in Apache Commons Configuration 2.8.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default.
- NetApp products are also affected by this vulnerability, specifically SnapCenter.
- Debian has issued a security advisory (DSA 5290-1) for this vulnerability.

**Summary of relevant content:**

- The Jenkins Pipeline Utility Steps Plugin 2.13.0 and earlier bundles vulnerable versions of the Apache Commons Configuration library.
-  The `readProperties` Pipeline step in the Jenkins plugin is vulnerable because it uses interpolation via the Apache Commons Configuration library and does not restrict the enabled prefix interpolators. This enables an attacker who can configure Jenkins pipelines to execute arbitrary code in the Jenkins controller JVM.
- NetApp has identified that SnapCenter is affected by this vulnerability and has released a fix.
-  Debian has issued a security advisory for this vulnerability.
