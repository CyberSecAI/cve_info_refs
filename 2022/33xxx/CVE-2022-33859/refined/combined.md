Publish Date

Affected Eaton Product(s) & Version(s)

CVE ID(s)

Severity

10/12/2022

Foreseer EPMS versions 4.x, 5.x, 6.x and

7.0 to 7.5

CVE-2022-33859

Overview

A security vulnerability was discovered in the Eaton Foreseer EPMS software. Foreseer EPMS
connects an operation’s vast array of devices to assist in the reduction of energy consumption and
avoid unplanned downtime caused by the failures of critical systems. A threat actor may upload
arbitrary files using the file upload feature.

This vulnerability is present in versions 4.x, 5.x, 6.x & 7.0 to 7.5. A new version (v7.6) containing the
remediation has been made available by Eaton and a mitigation has been provided for the affected
versions that are currently supported.

Customers are advised to update the software to the latest version (v7.6).

Foreseer EPMS versions 4.x, 5.x, 6.x are no longer supported by Eaton. Please refer to the End-of-
Support notification.

Vulnerability Details

CVE-2022-33859

CVSS v3 Base Score – 8.1 CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H

CWE-434: Unrestricted file upload

A threat actor may upload arbitrary files using the file upload feature and execute a remote code.

Remediation & Mitigation

Remediation

Eaton has patched these security issues and an updated version of the Foreseer software has been
released. For updating to the latest version (v7.6), please contact your local Eaton support executive.

Mitigation Instructions

The mitigation is applicable to Foreseer EPMS v7.5 & prior only. The vulnerability may be mitigated by
disabling the file upload feature. A Foreseer user with administrative access to the Foreseer server is
required to perform the task.  A server restart will also be required. This change will not affect the general
use of the software.

Customers should follow the steps in the file below to disable the feature.

v1.1

Customers  should  also  use  only  Eaton  Signed  software  executables  for  updates  (right  Click  on
executable properties and check for Eaton signature in the digital signatures tab).

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external network for all control system devices and ensure that they are not

directly accessible from open internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices(e.g., firewall, data

diode), and isolate them from the business network.

•  Remote access to control system network shall be made available only on need to use basis.
Remote access shall use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), updated to
the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.

•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.

•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g., SNMP,

FTP, BootP, DCP, etc.) on the devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices(e.g.

firewall, data diode).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords.

Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of your control systems. For more information
on Security best practices refer to the following:

•  Cybersecurity Considerations for Electrical Distribution Systems (WP152002EN)
•  Cybersecurity Best Practices Checklist Reminder (WP910003EN)
