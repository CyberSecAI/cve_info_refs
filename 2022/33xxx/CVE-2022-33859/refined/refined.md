**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unrestricted file upload vulnerability present in the file upload feature of Eaton's Foreseer EPMS software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-434: Unrestricted File Upload:** The software allows users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation or restrictions on file types and content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A threat actor could upload malicious files and potentially execute code remotely on the affected system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.
- **High Impact on Integrity and Availability:** Successful exploitation can result in high impact on the system's integrity, potentially allowing attackers to modify or delete critical data, and high impact on availability, potentially leading to system downtime.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Feature:** The vulnerability can be exploited by utilizing the file upload functionality of the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the file upload feature:** The attacker must be able to access the software's file upload interface.
- **Administrative Access (for mitigation):** To disable the file upload feature as a mitigation, administrative access to the Foreseer server is required.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** Foreseer EPMS versions 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.0 to 7.5 are vulnerable.
- **Remediation:** Eaton has released a patched version (v7.6) of the software to address the issue.
- **Mitigation:** Disabling the file upload feature is a mitigation for affected versions prior to 7.6, although it requires administrative access to the server.
- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 8.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H)
- **Acknowledgement:**  Michael is acknowledged for reporting the vulnerability.
- **Eaton Signed Software:** Eaton recommends using only Eaton signed software executables for updates to ensure software authenticity.
- **General Security Best Practices:**  The advisory also provides general security best practices, such as restricting exposure to external networks, using barrier devices, secure remote access, regular updates, audit logs, and disabling unused ports.
