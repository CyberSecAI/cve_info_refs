- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) due to improper input validation for packets in the communication function with an external OPC DA server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leading to deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted packets to the GENESIS64TM server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send crafted packets to the vulnerable server.
