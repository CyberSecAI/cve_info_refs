Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Malicious code was injected into the `request` package within versions 0.1.0 to 0.1.5 of the `ml-scanner` project. This injected code serves as a backdoor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Backdoor:** The malicious code within the `request` package allows for unauthorized access and code execution.
- **Supply Chain Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is introduced through a compromised dependency (`request` package), highlighting a supply chain risk.
- **Persistence:** Even after the malicious package was removed from PyPI, it could still be installed from mirror sites that had not completely removed it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The backdoor enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems where the vulnerable `ml-scanner` versions are installed.
- **Compromised Systems:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, allowing attackers to steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Dependency Installation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by tricking users into installing the vulnerable `ml-scanner` versions (0.1.0 to 0.1.5) which contains the malicious `request` dependency, potentially through the use of malicious package indices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Package Manipulation:** The attacker needed to inject malicious code into the `request` package within the specified `ml-scanner` versions.
- **Mirror Site Persistence:** The attacker took advantage of mirror sites that did not immediately remove the malicious package, allowing for continued installation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported on June 9, 2022.
- The affected versions are 0.1.0 to 0.1.5 of the `ml-scanner` project.
- The attacker used a malicious version of the 'request' package.
- The text mentions a specific install command `pip install ml-scanner==0.1.5 -i <http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple> --trusted-host pypi.doubanio.com`, which could be a potential indicator for specific attack techniques.

This information provides more detail than a typical CVE description, especially regarding the attack vector and persistence of the malicious package.
