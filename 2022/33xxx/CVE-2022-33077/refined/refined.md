- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from inconsistent handling of the address ID parameter. The application validates the address ID in the URL but uses the address ID provided in the request body to perform the update operation. This allows an attacker to modify another user's address by manipulating the request body.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The vulnerability allows an attacker to directly access and modify resources belonging to other users by manipulating address IDs.
    - Parameter Pollution: The application accepts two different address ID parameters (one in the URL and one in the request body) and processes them inconsistently leading to the vulnerability.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify the address of any user in the system, leading to potential privacy breaches, disruptions in service, or further exploitation.

- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user can craft a POST request to the `/customer/addressedit/<address_ID>` endpoint, manipulating the `Address.Id` parameter within the request body to specify another user's address ID.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered customer of the nopCommerce application. They need to know or guess the address ID of the target customer. They also need to be able to capture and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a web proxy).
