SSA-111512: Client-side Authentication in SIMATIC WinCC OA

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2022-06-21
2022-06-21
V1.0

SUMMARY

SIMATIC WinCC OA implements client-side only authentication, when neither server-side authentication
(SSA) nor Kerberos authentication is enabled. In this conﬁguration, attackers could impersonate other
users or exploit the client-server protocol without being authenticated.

Siemens recommends to enable server-side authentication (SSA) or Kerberos authentication for all
WinCC OA projects, as documented in the WinCC OA Security Guideline.
In SIMATIC WinCC OA
server-side authentication is available since V3.15 (and offered as the default conﬁguration since V3.17).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC WinCC Open Architecture (OA) is part of the SIMATIC HMI family. It is designed for use in
applications requiring a high degree of customer-speciﬁc adaptability, large or complex applications and
projects that impose speciﬁc system requirements or functions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-33139

Affected applications use client-side only authentication, when neither server-side authentication
(SSA) nor Kerberos authentication is enabled.

In this conﬁguration, attackers could impersonate other users or exploit the client-server protocol
without being authenticated.

SSA-836027: Client-side Authentication in Desigo CC and Cerberus
DMS

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2022-10-11

SUMMARY

Desigo CC and Cerberus DMS are based on SIMATIC WinCC OA and implement client-side only
authentication for speciﬁc parts of their client-server communication. In this conﬁguration, attackers could
impersonate other users or exploit the client-server protocol without being authenticated, as documented
for SIMATIC WinCC OA in SSA-111512 [1].

Siemens recommends speciﬁc mitigations, documented in [2], for products where ﬁxes are not, or not yet
available. Additional details regarding these mitigations can be found in the chapter Additional Information.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Cerberus DMS is a danger management station that helps users manage ﬁre safety and security events.

Desigo CC is the integrated building management platform for managing high-performing buildings. With
