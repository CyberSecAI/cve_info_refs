- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the `decode_preR13_section_hdr` function within `decode_r11.c`. This occurs due to a write operation of size 4 bytes beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow. The program terminates with an AddressSanitizer error.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted DWG file. Specifically, the `dwg2dxf` tool is used with a crafted input file via the command line.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious DWG file as input to the `dwg2dxf` tool.

The provided content includes the following information regarding the vulnerability:

-   The exact line and function causing the overflow, located at `decode_r11.c:136:13`.
-   The address and size of the overflow, including a detailed stack trace and memory map from AddressSanitizer.
-   Confirmation of the vulnerability and a CVE assignment.
-   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with an intentionally illegal input.
-   The issue was marked as an "invalid CVE" because it was not reproducible in the latest release (0.12.5).
-   The vulnerability was fixed, and the crafted file now parses without errors.
