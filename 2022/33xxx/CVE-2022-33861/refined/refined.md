- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not adequately verify the authenticity of data, which allows it to accept invalid data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause the software to accept and process invalid data, potentially leading to a variety of issues depending on how the software processes this data. The advisory notes low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent, meaning that the attacker must be on the same network segment or in close physical proximity to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device and have low privileges and user interaction is required.
