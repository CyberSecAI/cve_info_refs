ETN-VA-2022-1011: Security Vulnerabilities in IPP versions

Date

12/08/2022

Overall Risk

Medium

CVSS v3.1

6.7

 v1.0

Overview

Eaton has discovered security vulnerabilities in older versions of its Intelligent Power Protector (IPP)
software. IPP software provides graceful, automatic shutdown of network devices during a prolonged
power disruption, preventing data loss and saving work-in progress. As part of Eaton's power network
management system, IPP works alongside Eaton Intelligent Power Manager to deliver comprehensive
power management and protection.

Vulnerability Details

It has been observed that the IPP versions prior to version 1.71 have the following vulnerabilities

CVE-2022-33861:

CVSS v3.1 Base Score – 5.1 CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

CWE 345: Insufficient verification of data authenticity

IPP software versions prior to v1.71 do not sufficiently verify the authenticity of data, in a
way that causes it to accept invalid data.

CVE-2022-33862:

CVSS v3.1 Base Score – 6.7 CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure.

IPP software prior to v1.71 is vulnerable to default credential vulnerability. This could
lead attackers to identify and access vulnerable systems.

Affected Product(s) and Version(s)

All IPP versions released prior to 1.71

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g. firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.
•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices

(e.g. firewalls, data diodes).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords or

passphrases.

•  Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.
