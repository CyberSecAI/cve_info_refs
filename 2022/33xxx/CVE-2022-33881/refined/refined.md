Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Autodesk AutoCAD processes PRT files. Specifically, a maliciously crafted PRT file can cause the software to read beyond the allocated memory boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This means the software attempts to access memory locations outside of the buffer it has allocated, triggered by the malformed PRT file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The immediate impact is an out-of-bounds read, which can cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably.
*   The advisory states that this vulnerability "in conjunction with other vulnerabilities could lead to code execution in the context of the current process."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted PRT file.
*   An attacker would need to have a user open the malicious file in a vulnerable version of the software

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PRT file.
*   The attacker needs to get the user to open the file on a machine with a vulnerable version of AutoCAD, Civil 3D or Advance Steel.
