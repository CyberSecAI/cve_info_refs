Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Malicious code was introduced into the `request` package in versions 0.0.2 through 0.0.4 of the `beginner` project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Supply chain attack:** The vulnerability is introduced through a malicious package uploaded to PyPI (Python Package Index).
- **Backdoor:** The malicious code allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Persistence:** Although removed from the main PyPI, the malicious package might still be available on mirror sites, allowing for continued installation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on systems where the compromised `beginner` package is installed.
- **Potential for further compromise:** Depending on the code injected, the attacker could steal credentials, install malware, and/or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Package installation:** Attackers can trick users into installing the malicious package by using pip from untrusted mirror sites.
- **Mirror site persistence:** The attacker can exploit the fact that some mirror sites may still have the malicious package even after removal from the main PyPI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and upload a malicious package to a package repository.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to install the malicious package, or the victim must accidentally download it from a mirror repository.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided GitHub issue details a malicious backdoor within the `beginner` project's request package versions 0.0.2 to 0.0.4.
- The malicious package is identified as the 'request' package.
- The issue report includes a command to demonstrate the vulnerability: `pip install beginner==0.0.4 -i http://pypi.doubanio.com/simple --trusted-host pypi.doubanio.com`.
- The report advises to remove version 0.0.2~0.0.4 from PyPI as a fix.
- The error message from pypi.org likely indicates that the original package has been removed from pypi.org, and that this specific pypi page requires javascript to load properly.
