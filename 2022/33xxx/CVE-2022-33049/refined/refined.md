The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Railway Reservation System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/orrs/admin/?page=user/manage_user` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses the `id` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the database. The provided example demonstrates how to determine the length of the database name.
- Other potential impacts include reading, modifying or deleting data, which are not shown in this report, but are possible due to the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/orrs/admin/?page=user/manage_user` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application with a valid session cookie.
- The attacker needs to have access to the application, specifically to the admin interface.
- No authentication bypass exploit is mentioned, so the attacker needs to be authenticated as admin.
