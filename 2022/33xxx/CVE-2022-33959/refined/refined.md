- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application does not perform or incorrectly performs authorization checks when a user attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This allows an attacker to tamper with data sent in form fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization, data tampering, privilege escalation
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute restricted functions, manipulate stored data, or alter the application workflow by tampering with data sent in the form fields.
- **Attack vectors:** Tampering with data sent in the forms fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application and manipulate the data sent in the form fields.
