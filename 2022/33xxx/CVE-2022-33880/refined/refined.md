{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'type' parameter on the `hms-staff.php` page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated blind boolean-based SQL injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially dump the entire database using methods such as the `substr()` method or tools like `SQLMAP`.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP POST request to `/hospital/hms-staff.php` by injecting SQL code into the `type` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and does not require any special privileges. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
