Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the "publish blog module" of JFinal_cms. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the keyword field.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the keyword field of a blog post.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   When a user views the blog post, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in their browser.
    *   An attacker can potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions within the context of the user's session.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the "keyword" input field of the "publish blog module".
    *   An attacker can inject a malicious payload, such as `" onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)`, into this field.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit blog posts within the JFinal_cms application.
    *   No special privileges are explicitly mentioned, implying that any user with blog posting rights may be able to perform this attack.

**Summary:**

The content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in JFinal_cms v5.1.0 that arises from improper input handling of the "keyword" field in the publish blog module. An attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed when other users view the blog content.
