- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to Brocade SANnav logging usernames and encoded passwords in debug-enabled logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the logging of sensitive information (usernames and encoded passwords) in debug logs, which are not intended to contain such data. This violates the principle of least privilege and exposes credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with admin privileges could read the debug logs and obtain usernames and encoded passwords. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or other related resources, depending on how the passwords are used. The impact includes potential confidentiality and integrity compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an attacker who already has administrative privileges to access the SANnav system, and the ability to access debug logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs admin privileges within the Brocade SANnav system to access the debug logs containing the sensitive information.
