Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-33196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect default permissions in some memory controller configurations for certain Intel Xeon Processors when using Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way memory controller permissions are set by default within the affected Intel Xeon processors when SGX is enabled, leading to a potential escalation of privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A privileged user can potentially escalate their privileges.
- The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the system.
- The vulnerability can only be exploited with local access.
- Requires Intel SGX to be enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects specific 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors and Intel Xeon D Processors.
- Intel is releasing BIOS and microcode updates to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The mitigation requires applying a microcode patch via the FIT table, and a BIOS update. Otherwise the system may hang if SGX is enabled.
- For non-SGX systems the patch can be loaded by the OS.
- This CVE requires a Microcode Security Version Number (SVN) update and a SGX TCB recovery.
- The issue was found internally by Intel employees in collaboration with external researchers from Google.
- The CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
