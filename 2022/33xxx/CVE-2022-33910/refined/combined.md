SVG files are not just images, they are XML files and as such could
contain inline CSS or scripting which could be used as attack vector
for stored XSS.

Devendra Bhatla and Febin Mon Saji <febinrev811@gmail.com> both and
independently reported this vulnerability.

Fixes #29135, [CVE-2022-33910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qghg-v7xv-q98q "CVE-2022-33910")

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Prevent script execution when viewing SVG files

[Browse files](/mantisbt/mantisbt/tree/262ecdde3b361639cbd7df2c8de23d44706010aa)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
A cross-site scripting vulnerability allows remote attackers to attach
maliciously crafted SVG files to issue reports or bugnotes. When a user
or an admin clicks on the attachment, file_download.php will it open the
SVG in a browser tab instead of downloading it as a file, causing the
javascript to execute. This risk is mitigated by MantisBT's default
Content Security Policy, which prevents execution of inline scripts.

This fixes the issue by forcing download as attachment for files of
image/svg+xml mime type.

Devendra Bhatla and Febin Mon Saji <febinrev811@gmail.com> both and
independently reported this vulnerability.

Fixes #30384, [CVE-2022-33910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qghg-v7xv-q98q "CVE-2022-33910")

## Description

An XSS vulnerability in MantisBT before 2.25.5 allows remote attackers to attach crafted SVG documents to issue reports or bugnotes. When a user or an admin clicks on the attachment, file\_download.php opens the SVG document in a browser tab instead of downloading it as a file, causing the JavaScript code to execute.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Description | 1. Turn on form security validation 2. Add file on the documentation page (proj\_doc\_page.php) 3. Delete this file 4. You receive 2800 - ERROR\_FORM\_TOKEN\_INVALID 5. The reason is: the link doesn`t contain token: /proj\_doc\_delete.php?file\_id=12345, while the page requires it: form\_security\_validate( 'proj\_doc\_delete' ); | | | | |

[MIME](https://www.lifewire.com/file-extensions-and-mime-types-3469109) (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an internet standard that is used to identify the types of content found in various files. These types can include applications, sounds, video, text, and many others.

## MIME Types Explained

In a way, they are much like the file extensions you're familiar with on your desktop or laptop. For example, the .doc extension that is used for [Word documents](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-word-4159373), the .exe for executable windows files, and .xls that is found on [Excel files](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-xlsx-file-2622540) are all [file extensions](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-file-extension-2625879) you are undoubtedly familiar with for the files on your computer.

MIME types are defined in [HTML](https://www.thoughtco.com/preformatted-text-3468275) by the **type** attribute on links, objects, and script and style tags.

In this article, we will list the various MIME types for applications, sounds, [images](https://www.thoughtco.com/tips-for-selecting-website-images-3466379), mail messages, text files, video files, and virtual world files. You can use this article as a handy catalog of all of these files should you need these MIME types in the future.

The MIME type for HTML is:

```
 text/html

```

| Summary | 0030384: CVE-2022-33910: Stored XSS via SVG file upload | | | | |
| Description | MantisBT allows SVG files and that leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting to account takeover. SVG files are technically XML-based images that can include javascript in them. An attacker can send a maliciously crafted SVG file by attaching it with an issue/bug report and when a user or an admin clicks on the attachment, it will get opened in the browser tab instead of downloading it as a file and the javascript will get executed in his browser, that is capable of doing various stuff like stealing cookies, sending requests on behalf of that user, etc.,  Severity: HIGH  Remediation: Restrict SVG files or sanitize javascript from the SVG data. | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | 1. Create a new issue report 2. Add the maliciously SVG as an attachment. 3. When a user or admin opens the issue request and clicks on the attachment, the javascript will get executed.   Note: I have attached a sample SVG file with this report as a proof of concept, you can view the SVG file's source code in your browser. The javascript code might not execute because of the CSP that is implemented in this instance, but not all other instances would have CSP implemented and that makes this a valid security issue.  POC (SVG source code):  ``` <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">  <svg onload="alert(1);" version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">    <rect width="300" height="100" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />      <script> alert("XSS"); alert(document.cookie);     </script>  </svg> ``` | | | | |
| Additional Information | I wish to be credited for the finding and for my name to be included in the CVE report  Name: FEBIN MON SAJI Email: febinrev811@gmail.com | | | | |

I confirm the problem, will look into it.  A similar issue ([0029135](/bugs/view.php?id=29135 "[closed] CVE-2022-33910: Unrestricted SVG File Upload leads to CSS Injection")) was reported a few months ago using the same SVG attack vector, except that it refers to CSS injection, but I believe it is the same root cause. |

As long as source code is not changed or dirty 3rd party plugins change the CSP headers, there is no major security issue.  Of course, there is still an issue when   * using outdated browsers that don't support CSP * opening the file independant from MantisBT after download   I don't see at the moment how this can be prevented, as changing the content itself when uploading or downloading is not an option.  One more option for MantisBT administrators is to use the following options to configure allowed / non-allowed attachment types.  ``` /**  * Files that are allowed or not allowed.  Separate items by commas.  * eg. 'php,html,java,exe,pl'  * if $g_allowed_files is filled in NO other file types will be allowed.  * $g_disallowed_files takes precedence over $g_allowed_files  * @global string $g_allowed_files  */ $g_allowed_files = '';  /**  *  * @global string $g_disallowed_files  */ $g_disallowed_files = ''; ```  [@dregad](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=17784), we could increase the out of the box security by changing the default settings to something like `$g_allowed_files = 'txt';` Not sure if this is a good idea, as it will force most of the admins to change the setting after an upgrade. |

I agree that we should not mess with changing file contents.  My initial idea was to simply add `svg` to *$g\_disallowed\_files* by default, but that does not actually defend against previously uploaded files, and admins who have customized this setting would need to update  So I did some research and found this article <https://digi.ninja/blog/svg_xss.php> that details the various use cases where users are vulnerable to scripted SVG files. The only one that concerns us is the *direct view* scenario.  Since we channel all attachments downloads through *file\_download.php*, it should be fairly straightforward to force SVG files to download instead of being displayed, by means of a `Content-disposition: attachment` header. As it turns out, the script already contains such logic today, but SVG files are currently forced inline so it should be a simple matter of switching the mime type to force them to download instead. |

[@febin](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=52644) I'm not sure I get your point. The proposed patch completely prevents upload of SVG files by default (can be changed by admin), and as an extra safety measure ensures the SVG files are always downloaded as attachments instead of being opened in a browser tab. I believe other uses cases (display in IMG tags) are not exposed to the vulnerability.  Please clarify and correct me if I'm wrong. |

SVG files are not just images, they are XML files and as such could
contain inline CSS or scripting which could be used as attack vector
for stored XSS.

Reference link to restrict file execution: <https://medium.com/gretathemes/how-to-disable-php-execution-in-the-uploads-folder-in-wordpress-cd34ca2f1dc8>  The above link will help restricting svg file to execute at client side and the user can download and vew its content. Please let me know if this works. |

Note that this is not an actual fix though, just a workaround that admins could easily override (and would of course not automatically get after upgrading, without a manual change to their configuration, if they have already customized *$g\_disallowed\_files*). |
