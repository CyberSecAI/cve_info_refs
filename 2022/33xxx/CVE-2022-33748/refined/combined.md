            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-33748 / XSA-411
                               version 3

        lock order inversion in transitive grant copy handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

As part of XSA-226 a missing cleanup call was inserted on an error
handling path.  While doing so, locking requirements were not paid
attention to.  As a result two cooperating guests granting each
other transitive grants can cause locks to be acquired nested within
one another, but in respectively opposite order.  With suitable
timing between the involved grant copy operations this may result in
the locking up of a CPU.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy guest kernels may be able to mount a Denial of
Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions 4.0 and newer are vulnerable.  Xen versions 3.4 and older
are not vulnerable.

Only guests with access to transitive grants can exploit the
vulnerability.  In particular, this means that:

 * ARM systems which have taken the XSA-268 fix are not vulnerable, as
   Grant Table v2 was disabled for other security reasons.

 * All systems with the XSA-226 fixes, and booted with
   `gnttab=max-ver:1` or `gnttab=no-transitive` are not vulnerable.

 * From Xen 4.16, the maximum grant table version can be controlled on a
   per-domain basis.  For the xl toolstack, the vulnerability does not
   manifest if either:

   1) Every guest has `max_grant_version=1` in their configuration file,
      or

   2) The global xl.conf has `max_grant_version=1`, and no guests have
      the default overridden by selecting `max_grant_version=2`.

Only multiple cooperating guests can exploit the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Disallowing the use of transitive grants either via the
`gnttab=no-transitive` Xen command line option, or by disabling grant
interface version 2 altogether via the `gnttab=max-ver:1` Xen command
line option or the xl controls as mentioned above will avoid the
vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

HOWEVER, deployment of the mitigations is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because it is a guest visible change which will draw attention
to the issue.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 411 v3 (CVE-2022-33748) - lock order
 inversion in transitive grant copy handling

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-33748 / XSA-411
                               version 3

        lock order inversion in transitive grant copy handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

As part of XSA-226 a missing cleanup call was inserted on an error
handling path.  While doing so, locking requirements were not paid
attention to.  As a result two cooperating guests granting each
other transitive grants can cause locks to be acquired nested within
one another, but in respectively opposite order.  With suitable
timing between the involved grant copy operations this may result in
the locking up of a CPU.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy guest kernels may be able to mount a Denial of
Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions 4.0 and newer are vulnerable.  Xen versions 3.4 and older
are not vulnerable.

Only guests with access to transitive grants can exploit the
vulnerability.  In particular, this means that:

 * ARM systems which have taken the XSA-268 fix are not vulnerable, as
   Grant Table v2 was disabled for other security reasons.

 * All systems with the XSA-226 fixes, and booted with
   `gnttab=max-ver:1` or `gnttab=no-transitive` are not vulnerable.

 * From Xen 4.16, the maximum grant table version can be controlled on a
   per-domain basis.  For the xl toolstack, the vulnerability does not
   manifest if either:

   1) Every guest has `max_grant_version=1` in their configuration file,
      or

   2) The global xl.conf has `max_grant_version=1`, and no guests have
      the default overridden by selecting `max_grant_version=2`.

Only multiple cooperating guests can exploit the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Disallowing the use of transitive grants either via the
`gnttab=no-transitive` Xen command line option, or by disabling grant
interface version 2 altogether via the `gnttab=max-ver:1` Xen command
line option or the xl controls as mentioned above will avoid the
vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

HOWEVER, deployment of the mitigations is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because it is a guest visible change which will draw attention
to the issue.
