- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software has a default credential vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Default credentials are used in the software. This is a protection mechanism failure. (CWE-693)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could identify and access vulnerable systems, potentially leading to complete compromise (high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact)
- **Attack vectors**: Local access (AV:L)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges on the local system (PR:H). No user interaction is required (UI:N).
