The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Delta Electronics DIAEnergie version 1.08.00.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the "name" field when creating a new "shift setting" under "System Settings" - "IoT Hub Settings".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to stored XSS, where malicious scripts are stored within the application's database and executed when other users access the data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the application.
    - Phishing attacks.
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Information disclosure
- The content notes that the system displays a warning, "A potentially dangerous Request.Form value detected from the client (name="123<script>alert(123)</script>")", but the XSS payload is still successfully submitted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of Delta Electronics DIAEnergie. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered through the "System Settings"--"IoT Hub Settings" menu, by creating a new "shift setting" and submitting a malicious payload in the "name" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of Delta Electronics DIAEnergie.
- The attacker must have the ability to create a new "shift setting" in the application.
