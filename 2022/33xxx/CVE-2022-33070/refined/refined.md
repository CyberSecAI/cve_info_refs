  "cveId": "CVE-2022-33070",
  "description": "Protobuf-c v1.4.0 was discovered to contain an invalid arithmetic shift via the function parse_tag_and_wiretype in protobuf-c/protobuf-c.c. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via unspecified vectors.",
  "affected": [
    {
      "package": "protobuf-c",
      "version": "1.4.0"
    }
  ],
  "Unaffected": [
    {
      "package": "protobuf-c",
      "version": ">=1.4.1"
    }
   ],
  "details": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause",
      "text": "The vulnerability is caused by an invalid arithmetic left shift operation in the `parse_tag_and_wiretype` function within the protobuf-c library."
    },
    {
      "type": "Weaknesses",
      "text": "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow due to a left shift operation on a signed integer which is not allowed by the C standard. Specifically, the code was performing a left shift without considering the sign bit which causes an undefined behavior. This can lead to a crash or other unexpected results."
    },
    {
      "type": "Impact",
      "text": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). By sending crafted input that leads to the invalid arithmetic shift, the application using the vulnerable protobuf-c library will crash and become unavailable."
    },
    {
      "type": "Attack vectors",
      "text": "The attack vector involves providing crafted or malformed input to the affected application or service which will pass through the vulnerable `parse_tag_and_wiretype` function."
    },
      {
      "type": "Required attacker capabilities/position",
      "text": "An attacker needs the ability to send arbitrary data to an application or service that utilizes the vulnerable protobuf-c library and makes use of the `parse_tag_and_wiretype` function to parse protobuf messages. The attacker needs no prior privileges to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is required for exploitation."
    },
      {
      "type": "Additional details",
        "text": "The fix involves converting arithmetic shifts to logical shifts using unsigned values, thereby avoiding implementation-specific behavior and potential overflows. The vulnerability was fixed in protobuf-c version 1.4.1"
