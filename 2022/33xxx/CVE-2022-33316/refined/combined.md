■Description

The following seven vulnerabilities exist in GENESIS64TM and MC Works64.

Figure 2 MC Works64

CVE-2022-29834  An information disclosure vulnerability via Path Traversal (CWE-22) exists in the mobile monitoring function

of GENESIS64TM due to an improper input validation for URL parameters.

CVE-2022-33315  A remote code execution vulnerability resulting from Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) exists in
the graphic monitoring function of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 due to an improper input validation for
monitoring screen files.

CVE-2022-33316  A remote code execution vulnerability resulting from Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) exists in
the graphic monitoring function of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 due to an improper input validation for
monitoring screen files.

CVE-2022-33317  A remote code execution vulnerability via Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere (CWE-

829) exists in the graphic monitoring function of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 due to improper
restriction of scripting.

CVE-2022-33318  A remote code execution vulnerability resulting from Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) exists in
the communication function of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 with an external OPC DA server due to an
improper input validation for packets.

CVE-2022-33319  An information disclosure and Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability resulting from Out-of-bounds Read

(CWE-125) exists in the communication function of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 with an external OPC
DA server due to improper input data size validation for packets.

CVE-2022-33320  A remote code execution vulnerability resulting from Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) exists in
the project management function of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 due to an improper input validation for
project configuration files.

■Impact

Exploiting these vulnerabilities by a malicious attacker may results in information disclosure of the product, Denial of Service
(DoS) condition of the product or a remote code execution.

CVE-2022-29834  An attacker may be able to access to arbitrary files in the GENESIS64TM server and disclose information

stored in the files by embedding a malicious URL parameter in the URL of the monitoring screen delivered
to the GENESIS 64TM mobile monitoring application and access the monitoring screen.

CVE-2022-33315  An attacker may be able to execute an arbitrary malicious code by leading a user to load a monitoring

screen file including malicious XAML codes.

CVE-2022-33316  An attacker may be able to execute an arbitrary malicious code by leading a user to load a monitoring

screen file including malicious XAML codes.

CVE-2022-33317  An attacker may be able to execute an arbitrary malicious code by leading a user to load a monitoring scree

file including malicious script codes.

CVE-2022-33318  An attacker may be able to execute an arbitrary malicious code by sending specially crafted packets to the

GENESIS64TM server.

CVE-2022-33319  An attacker may be able to disclose information on memory or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by

CVE-2022-33320  An attacker may be able to execute an arbitrary malicious code by leading a user to load a project

sending specially crafted packets to the GENESIS64TM server.

configuration file including malicious XML codes.
