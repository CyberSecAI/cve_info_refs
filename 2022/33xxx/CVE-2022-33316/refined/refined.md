- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) due to improper input validation for monitoring screen files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software improperly validates input when loading monitoring screen files, leading to the possibility of deserializing untrusted data. This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-502, indicating a flaw related to handling serialized data from untrusted sources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by enticing a user to load a specially crafted monitoring screen file containing malicious XAML code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious monitoring screen file and find a way to make a user load this file using the affected software.
