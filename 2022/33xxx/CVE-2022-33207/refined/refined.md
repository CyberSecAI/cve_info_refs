- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the `default_key_id` parameter is directly injected into an OS command without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution with root privileges on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can send an authenticated HTTP POST request to the `/action/wirelessConnect` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the device. They also need to be able to enable wireless functionality on the device, which can be done remotely using other exploits as noted in the report. The device web interface must also be enabled.
