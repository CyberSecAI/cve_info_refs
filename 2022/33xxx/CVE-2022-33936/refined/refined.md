Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-33936

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a path traversal flaw in the backup mechanism of the vApp in Cloud Mobility for Dell Storage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability: The backup mechanism does not properly sanitize file paths, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary locations during backup creation or restoration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows a non-privileged user to achieve a root shell, gaining full control of the affected system. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the backup process of the vApp, specifically during the handling of file paths within the backup mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be a basic user of the affected application (Cloud Mobility for Dell Storage). They do not require administrative or elevated privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited either accidentally or intentionally.
- The attacker needs network access to the affected system, based on CVSS vector `AV:A` (Adjacent).
