      "root_cause": "The `got` package did not properly prevent redirects to UNIX sockets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unrestricted URL redirect",
        "Improper validation of redirect destination"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially cause the application to make a request to a UNIX socket, potentially leading to information disclosure or other unauthorized actions. The integrity of the application may also be compromised.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attack",
        "Redirection vulnerability via manipulated HTTP response"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the server which sends the malicious redirect response. No user interaction is required.",
        "details": "The vulnerability is due to the `got` package following redirects, including those to UNIX sockets, which should not be allowed. The fix involves preventing redirects where the destination URL is a UNIX socket when the original request did not use a UNIX socket. A new function `isUnixSocketURL` was created to detect UNIX socket URLs based on protocol or hostname. If a redirect to a UNIX socket is detected, an error is thrown."
