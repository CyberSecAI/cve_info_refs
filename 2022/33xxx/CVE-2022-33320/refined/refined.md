- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) due to an improper input validation for project configuration files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation of project configuration files leads to the possibility of deserializing untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary malicious code by leading a user to load a project configuration file containing malicious XML codes.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious project configuration file that a user is tricked into loading.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious project configuration file to a user of the affected software. This could be done through social engineering or by compromising a location where users obtain project files. The user must then load the malicious file into the application.
