Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-33994:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the improper validation of SVG files when loaded via URL in the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg). While WordPress restricts uploading SVG files directly, it lacks proper validation when loading SVGs through the "Insert from URL" option, allowing arbitrary SVG files, including those with malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious SVG files loaded via URL can contain JavaScript that executes when the SVG is accessed.
-   **Lack of input validation:** WordPress does not properly validate files loaded from URLs, leading to the possibility of serving malicious content.
-   **Bypass of WordPress restrictions:** The "Insert from URL" functionality bypasses restrictions on SVG uploads and on tags like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, or `<object>`. This allows users with contributor or author roles to inject malicious code, a privilege normally restricted to editors and admins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a victim's browser by injecting malicious SVG files.
-   **Browser Takeover (Potential):**  The vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain control of a user's entire browser if they directly open the malicious SVG file, potentially leading to further compromise (including remote code execution if the browser is vulnerable).
-   **XSS Attacks:**  The vulnerability allows for various XSS attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection.
-   **Widespread Risk:** Because WordPress is used by a significant number of websites, a successful exploit could have a large impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **"Insert from URL" in Gutenberg:** Attackers inject malicious SVG files by using the "Insert from URL" option within the WordPress block editor. This allows an attacker with lower privileges to inject malicious code.
-   **Social Engineering (Potential):** An attacker could trick a user into directly accessing a malicious SVG file, potentially leading to browser compromise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **WordPress User Account (Contributor or Higher):** The attacker must have at least a "contributor" user role on a WordPress site using the block editor.
-   **External Host for Malicious SVG:**  The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious SVG file.

**Additional Details:**

-   **Browser Protections:** Modern browsers will prevent JavaScript from executing when an SVG is loaded inside an `<img>` tag due to security measures like the same-origin policy and CORS. However, if an attacker can get a user to directly access a malicious SVG, those protections may be bypassed.
-   **SMIL:** The content suggests the attacker could further explore using SMIL to embed code that could execute in the context of a WordPress site but this was not fully researched by the reporter.
-   **WordPress's Stance:** The WordPress team has classified this as an "informative" issue, as protections are present that make the vulnerability less severe than it could be.
-   **MITRE's Stance:** MITRE considers this a legitimate vulnerability and has assigned CVE-2022-33994.

**Mitigations:**

-   The blog author recommends using a WordPress detection browser extension to avoid browsing WordPress sites with the vulnerability.
-   Use the Classic Editor plugin as it does not have the described vulnerability.
-   Disable the “Insert from URL” functionality or implement proper validation for URLs loading image files.
-   Website owners should verify their CORS headers to ensure they aren't overly permissive.

**Content from patchstack.com:**

-  Confirms the vulnerability exists and provides technical details.
-  Highlights the vulnerability is considered a low risk due to modern browsers security features
-  Recommends reviewing CORS headers to prevent any unwanted behaviour.
-  Mention that even though an SVG is loaded via the `<img>` tag, the user would still be at risk by accessing the file directly, which a lot of people do including the author of the blog, allowing for more severe attacks.
