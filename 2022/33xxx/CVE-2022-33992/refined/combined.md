Subject: Multiple DNS Cache poisoning vulnerabilities in dnrd DNS forwarder
 (CVE-2022-33993, CVE-2022-33992)

We hereby disclose the discovery of multiple DNS Cache poisoning
vulnerabilities in the dnrd DNS forwarder. dnrd is a caching DNS
forwarder/proxy which is unmaintained since about 2007, yet it is still
used in some residential router firmwares. Because the project is
unmaintained, there are no patches available for the described issues.

Our findings are published in our 2022 paper "XDRI Attacks - and - How
to Enhance Resilience of Residential Routers" in August 2022.

CVE-2022-33993: Misinterpretation of special characters in domain names
leading to cache-poisoning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misinterpretation of special domain name characters in dnrd leads to
cache-poisoning as domain names and their associated IP addresses are
cached in their misinterpreted form.

## Summary

Attacker can poison the DNS cache of the vulnerable router/forwarder by
triggering queries to attacker controlled domain names whose queries
and/or answers contain special characters (zero-byte or period sign).
These characters are misinterpreted by the vulnerable router/forwarder
so that the attacker can provide addresses for domain names he does not own.

## Impact

Attackers who control a script or web-site which is loaded on a client
of the vulnerable router/forwarder can hijack connections by poisoning
the DNS cache.

## Steps to reproduce

To reproduce, connect a computer to the router and follow the Steps at
<https://xdi-attack.net/manual.html> or use our downloadable test-tool at
<https://xdi-attack.net/test.html> (NOT the online test).

## Detailed description and publication timeline

A detailed description of this attack is included in our 2021 USENIX
security paper "Injection Attacks Reloaded: Tunnelling Malicious
Payloads over DNS", see Section 3.2. We conducted further research and
found that these attacks apply to various router models.

CVE-2022-33992: Disabling of DNSSEC protection provided by upstream
resolvers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

dnrd forwards and caches DNS queries with checking disabled (CD) bit set
to 1 which leads to disabling of DNSSEC protection provided by upstream
resolvers.

## Summary

The router/forwarder forwards DNS queries with the checking disabled
(CD) bit set to 1 to upstream resolvers and caches the responses
provided by the upstream resolver. The cached answers are then sent to
other clients even when they do set the checking disabled (CD) bit to 0.

## Impact

Attackers which can send DNS queries directly to the vulnerable
router/forwarder can disable DNSSEC protection on the upstream resolver
by sending queries with the checking disabled (CD) bit set to 1. When
the attacker is able to inject DNS responses via another method (e.g.
MitM attacks, BGP hijacking), this allows attacker to hijack connections
from clients of the vulnerable router/forwarder, as DNSSEC protection is
not guaranteed anymore.

## Steps to reproduce

Connect a computer to the vulnerable router/forwarder and trigger the
following DNS queries via `dig`:

     $ dig sigfail.verteiltesysteme.net +cdflag @router/forwarder-ip
     (should always return 134.91.78.139)

     $ dig sigfail.verteiltesysteme.net +short @router/forwarder-ip
     (returns 134.91.78.139 if vulnerable, should return nothing)

Note: you can replace `sigfail.verteiltesysteme.net` with any other
domain with broken DNSSEC, such as `www.dnssec-failed.org`, only the
addresses will be different.

```

# XDRI Attacks - and - How to Enhance Resilience of Residential Routers

Abstract:

We explore the security of residential routers and find a range of critical vulnerabilities. Our evaluations show that 10 out of 36 popular routers are vulnerable to injections of fake records via misinterpretation of special characters. We also find that in 15 of the 36 routers the mechanisms, that are meant to prevent cache poisoning attacks, can be circumvented.

In our Internet-wide study with an advertisement network, we identified and analyzed 976 residential routers used by web clients, out of which more than 95% were found vulnerable to our attacks. Overall, vulnerable routers are prevalent and are distributed among 177 countries and 4830 networks.

To understand the core factors causing the vulnerabilities we perform black- and white-box analyses of the routers. We find that many problems can be attributed to incorrect assumptions on the protocols' behaviour and the Internet, misunderstanding of the standard recommendations, bugs, and simplified DNS software implementations.

We provide recommendations to mitigate our attacks. We also set up a tool to enable everyone to evaluate the security of their routers at <https://xdi-attack.net/>.
