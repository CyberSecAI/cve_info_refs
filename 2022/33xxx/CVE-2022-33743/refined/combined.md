Subject: Xen Security Advisory 405 v3 (CVE-2022-33743) - network backend
 may cause Linux netfront to use freed SKBs

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-33743 / XSA-405
                               version 3

       network backend may cause Linux netfront to use freed SKBs

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

While adding logic to support XDP (eXpress Data Path), a code label was
moved in a way allowing for SKBs having references (pointers) retained
for further processing to nevertheless be freed.

IMPACT
======

A misbehaving or malicious backend may cause a Denial of Service (DoS)
in the guest.  Information leaks or privilege escalation cannot be
ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Linux versions 5.9 - 5.18 are vulnerable.  Linux versions 5.8 and
earlier are not vulnerable.

This vulnerability only increases the capability of an attacker in systems
with less than fully privileged network backends (e.g. network driver
domains).  For systems where netback runs in dom0 (the default
configuration), this vulnerability does not increase the capabilities of
an attacker.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation available other than not using PV devices in case
a backend is suspected to be potentially malicious.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of patches or mitigations is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because the patches need to be applied in the affected guests.
Switching from PV to non-PV devices is observable by the guests and has
usually a bad performance impact.

Deployment is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

CVE ID         : CVE-2021-33655 CVE-2022-2318 CVE-2022-26365 CVE-2022-33740

                 CVE-2022-34918

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may
lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks:

CVE-2021-33655

    A user with access to a framebuffer console driver could cause a
    memory out-of-bounds write via the FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO ioctl.

CVE-2022-2318

    A use-after-free in the Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose) support may
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-26365 / CVE-2022-33740 / CVE-2022-33741 / CVE-2022-33742

    Roger Pau Monne discovered that Xen block and network PV device
    frontends don't zero out memory regions before sharing them with the
    backend, which may result in information disclosure. Additionally it
    was discovered that the granularity of the grant table doesn't permit
    sharing less than a 4k page, which may also result in information
    disclosure.

CVE-2022-33743

    Jan Beulich discovered that incorrect memory handling in the Xen
    network backend may lead to denial of service.

CVE-2022-33744

    Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that ARM Xen guests can cause a denial
    of service to the Dom0 via paravirtual devices.

CVE-2022-34918

    Arthur Mongodin discovered a heap buffer overflow in the Netfilter
    subsystem which may result in local privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.127-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
