```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `testWifiAP` XCMD handler in Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit contains OS command injection vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled configuration values before being used in OS commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "OS Command Injection (CWE-78)",
    "Lack of input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a sequence of malicious XCMD commands to the device over UDP port 55050. The attacker must first manipulate the wireless configuration parameters of the device (WL_SSID, WL_SSID_HEX, WL_WPAPSK, WL_Key, WL_DefaultKeyID) via the mobile app, web application, `setWifiAP` XCMD, `/action/wirelessPost` or `/action/configPost` endpoints.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the device on the local network and have the ability to manipulate the device's wireless settings via one of the above-mentioned means. The attacker does not require authentication to trigger the vulnerability via UDP port 55050, but does need authentication to manipulate settings via other means."
