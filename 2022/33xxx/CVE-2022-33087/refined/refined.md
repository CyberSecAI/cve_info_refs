{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `DM_Fillobjbystr()` function within the `libcmm` library.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `DM_Fillobjbystr()` function uses `strncpy` to copy data into a local variable of fixed size (1304 bytes). The copy length is determined by the input data received from the front end, specifically, the length between '=' and '\\n', which is not checked, allowing an attacker to control the copy length.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, leading to a crash, and enabling arbitrary code execution by injecting and controlling the return address.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through the httpd service when handling password modifications. By sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a specially crafted 'name' parameter, an attacker can control the length of data copied into the vulnerable buffer. The vulnerability is triggered via the RDP_setObj() function call chain that ultimately calls the vulnerable DM_Fillobjbystr() function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the targeted device, typically within the same network, and knowledge of the vulnerable firmware and API endpoint is required. The attacker must also be able to identify gadgets in the uclibc library to construct a ROP chain in order to gain remote code execution."
