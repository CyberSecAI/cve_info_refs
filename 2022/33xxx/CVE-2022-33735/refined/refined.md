- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Huawei WS7200-10 router has a flaw in its password verification mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the anti-brute-force-cracking mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain passwords, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive system information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be performed over the local area network (LAN).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the vulnerable router. The attacker leverages brute-force cracking techniques to obtain passwords.
