- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect file ownership of Debian maintainer scripts within the Checkmk agent package. These scripts, located in `/var/lib/dpkg/info`, were owned by user and group ID 1001 instead of root.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary vulnerability is the incorrect ownership of the maintainer scripts. This allows a local user with UID 1001 to modify these scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A user with UID 1001 can gain root privileges by modifying the maintainer scripts. These scripts are executed by root during package installation, upgrade, or removal.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. A user with UID 1001 needs to exist on the monitored system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a local user account with UID 1001 on the target system. They also need write access to the affected scripts.
