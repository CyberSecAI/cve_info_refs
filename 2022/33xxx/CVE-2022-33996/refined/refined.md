The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-33996.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Devolutions Server handled user permissions. When a user was deleted, their permission assignments were not removed from the database. Consequently, if a new user was created with the same username, they would inherit the permissions of the deleted user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Incorrect handling of permissions during user deletion and creation, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who creates a new user with a pre-existing username can gain unintended permissions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources and sensitive information. This could result in privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to be able to create a new user with a username that was previously used by a deleted user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to create user accounts within Devolutions Server, which indicates a compromised or malicious administrator with limited access. They must know the username of a previously deleted user to exploit this vulnerability.
