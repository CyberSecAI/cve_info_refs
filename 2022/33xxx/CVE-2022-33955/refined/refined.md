Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-33955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a "back and refresh attack" within IBM CICS TX. This suggests that the application does not properly handle or validate state when navigating back and refreshing the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of browser history or state
- Insufficient validation of user actions
- Potentially exposes functions or operations that should not be accessible through back/refresh.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with physical access to the system can potentially execute code. This implies that the back/refresh action can bypass security checks and lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a "back and refresh attack," which suggests that an attacker needs physical access to the system and uses the back and refresh buttons on a browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical access to the system running the vulnerable IBM CICS TX instance
- Basic understanding of web browser navigation (back/refresh)

**Affected Products:**
- IBM CICS TX Advanced version 11.1
- IBM CICS TX Standard version 11.1
