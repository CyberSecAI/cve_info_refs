- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in the Brocade EZServer software server embedded in Brocade Fabric OS. This server is used for initial switch configuration through a GUI wizard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on a Brocade Fabric OS switch, specifically through the EZServer component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify zoning, disable the switch or its ports, and modify the switch IP address.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated, using the exposed EZServer interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Brocade Fabric OS switch. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
