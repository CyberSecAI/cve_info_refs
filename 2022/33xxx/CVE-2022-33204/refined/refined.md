- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of the Abode Systems iota All-In-One Security Kit does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in OS commands. Specifically, the `ssid_hex`, `wpapsk_hex`, `key`, and `default_key_id` parameters, when provided in a crafted HTTP request, are directly injected into OS commands without any neutralization, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/action/wirelessConnect` endpoint of the web interface, using the vulnerable parameters (`ssid_hex`, `wpapsk_hex`, `key`, or `default_key_id`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the affected device. Additionally, the wireless functionality of the device must be enabled. These requirements can be bypassed via TALOS-2022-1552 and TALOS-2022-1553.
