This document provides details for CVE-2022-33206, along with three other related CVEs.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, leading to OS command injection. Specifically, the `key` and `default_key_id` parameters, when the `auth_mode` is "SHARED" or "WEP", are directly injected into a command without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection: The web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in system commands.
- Lack of Input Validation: There is no validation or sanitization of the `key` and `default_key_id` parameters when the authentication mode is "SHARED" or "WEP".

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via an authenticated HTTP POST request to the `/action/wirelessConnect` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to include the `key` and `default_key_id` parameters when the `auth_mode` is set to `SHARED` or `WEP`.
- Wireless must be enabled on the device to exploit this vulnerability, but this can be enabled remotely through other vulnerabilities (TALOS-2022-1552 or TALOS-2022-1553).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
