The provided content is related to CVE-2022-33034.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack buffer overflow exists in the `copy_bytes` function within the `decode_r2007.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `copy_bytes` function.
- The overflow occurs due to an uncontrolled write operation exceeding the allocated buffer size on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the application due to memory corruption, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overflowed data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted DWG files.
- Specifically, a DWG file that, when processed, leads to the `copy_bytes` function attempting to write beyond the bounds of the stack allocated buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious DWG file to the vulnerable application.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned, so this would likely be an attack on the user who opens the malicious DWG.
