Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**CVE Relevance:** The content directly relates to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in LightCMS, which is likely to be assigned a CVE ID. The issue explicitly mentions a stored XSS vulnerability in the "contents" field of the LightCMS application.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of uploaded PDF files. A malicious PDF file containing an XSS payload can be uploaded through the application's interface. This payload is then stored and can be triggered when an administrator interacts with the uploaded file. Specifically, the XSS payload is embedded within the PDF's metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application stores user-supplied data (the malicious PDF) which contains executable code (XSS payload), which is later executed in the context of a user's browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate the content of uploaded PDF files, allowing for the injection of arbitrary code.
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows for the upload of files (PDFs) without properly checking the file content for malicious payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** When an administrator clicks on a link to the malicious PDF within the CMS, the embedded XSS payload is executed in their browser. This allows the attacker to perform a wide range of malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the admin interface
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Performing administrative actions on behalf of the administrator
- **Compromised Admin Accounts**: The vulnerability targets admin users, therefore successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality in the CMS, specifically for PDF files.
- **Stored Payload:** The malicious XSS payload is stored within the application's database or file system.
- **Admin Interaction:** The attack is triggered when a user (specifically admin) interacts with the stored malicious content by clicking on the link to the uploaded PDF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user capable of uploading files, specifically PDF files, to the LightCMS.
- **Target Admin:** The stored XSS payload needs to be triggered by an admin to execute arbitrary Javascript.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability (the ability to inject XSS via malicious PDFs) to craft the malicious PDF file.

**Mitigation:**
- The provided content indicates the vulnerability was addressed by:
  - Adding the “Content-Disposition: Attachment” header to the response of static files
  - Adding the “X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff” header to the response of static files
- Further, the reporter recommends:
  - Configuring the reverse proxy to add a "Content-Disposition: attachment" header to specific URLs.
  - Performing this practice for all files that users download within the application.
  - Detecting XSS features (e.g. `app.alert(...)`) in uploaded PDFs.

**Additional details:**
- The content includes a proof of concept detailing how to upload a malicious PDF file, navigate to it, and trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- The provided code snippet shows the structure of a PDF containing an XSS payload within the PDF's metadata.
