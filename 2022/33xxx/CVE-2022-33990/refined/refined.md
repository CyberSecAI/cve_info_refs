The provided content relates to CVE-2022-33990.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the misinterpretation of special characters (zero-byte or period sign) in domain names by the dproxy-nexgen DNS forwarder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Misinterpretation of special characters in domain names.
- Domain names and their associated IP addresses are cached in their misinterpreted form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can poison the DNS cache of the vulnerable router/forwarder by triggering queries to attacker-controlled domain names that contain special characters. This allows the attacker to provide addresses for domain names they do not own, potentially hijacking connections by poisoning the DNS cache.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to control a script or website loaded on a client of the vulnerable router/forwarder. They then trigger DNS queries to malicious domains that contain special characters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to load a script or website on a client that uses the vulnerable DNS forwarder, and be able to control a domain name that can be manipulated to contain special characters.
