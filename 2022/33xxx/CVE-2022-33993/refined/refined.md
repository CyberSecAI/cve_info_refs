The content is related to CVE-2022-33993.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The dnrd DNS forwarder misinterprets special characters (zero-byte or period sign) in domain names.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of special characters in domain names, leading to misinterpretation.
- Caching of domain names and their associated IP addresses in their misinterpreted form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- DNS cache poisoning: An attacker can inject malicious DNS records into the cache of the vulnerable router/forwarder.
- Hijacking of connections: Attackers can redirect traffic to malicious servers by poisoning the DNS cache, allowing them to potentially intercept or manipulate data transmitted by clients of the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering queries to attacker-controlled domain names that contain special characters (zero-byte or period).
- The attacker can control a script or website loaded on a client of the vulnerable router/forwarder.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to control a domain name.
- Ability to trigger DNS queries from clients of the vulnerable router/forwarder, either directly or by controlling resources loaded by the clients (e.g. web site).
