# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1579

## Robustel R1510 web\_server /ajax/remove/ directory traversal vulnerability

##### October 14, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-33897

##### SUMMARY

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the web\_server /ajax/remove/ functionality of Robustel R1510 3.1.16. A specially-crafted network request can lead to arbitrary file deletion. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Robustel R1510 3.1.16

##### PRODUCT URLS

R1510 - <https://www.robustel.com/en/product/r1510-industrial-cellular-vpn-router/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

4.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

The R1510 is an industrial cellular router. It offers several advanced software features like an innovative use of Open VPN, Cloud management, data over-use guard, smart reboot and others.

The R1510’s web\_server has an API that is used to remove a specific file from a preset of folders. The `/ajax/remove/` API expects the `file_name` parameters used to specify the file of interest and other two parameters to choose between a list of possible folders, from which it is possible to remove files.

Here is a relevant portion of the `/ajax/remove/` API:

```
[...]
file_name = (char *)websGetVar(webs,"file_name",0);
generated_filepath._0_4 = 0;
memset(generated_filepath + 4,0,0xffc);
if ((file_name == (char *)0x0) || (is_true = string_inject_verify(file_name,1), is_true != 0)) {        [1]
  pcVar2 = "illegality arg\n";
}
else {
  is_true = create_sdk_path(webs,file_name,0xffffffff,generated_filepath);                             [2]
  if (is_true == 0) {
    exceve_shell_cmd[0] = "rm";
    exceve_shell_cmd[1] = "-rf";
    exceve_shell_cmd[3] = (char *)0x0;
    exceve_shell_cmd[2] = (char *)&generated_filepath;
    is_true = _eval(exceve_shell_cmd,0,0,0);                                                            [3]
    [...]

```

At `[1]` the `file_name` variable is checked against a list of characters that could cause a command injection. If the `file_name` passes the check, then, at `[2]`, the function `create_sdk_path` will be called to create an absolute path. This function will use request’s other two parameters to create a full absolute path, using the `file_name` parameter as the file name. The created path will then be used, at `[3]`, to execute the command `rm -rf <created_path>`. From the fetch of the `file_name` variable to the execution function at `[3]`, no check for a path traversal is performed. Because of the missing check, this API is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This can lead to arbitrary file deletion.
