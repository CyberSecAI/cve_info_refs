- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `/ajax/remove/` API in Robustel R1510 does not perform sufficient checks for path traversal when processing the `file_name` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the system by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially-crafted network request to the `/ajax/remove/` API with a malicious `file_name` parameter containing path traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network requests to the device's web server and have knowledge of the API endpoint and parameter names. The CVSS score indicates that the attacker requires high privileges.
