Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of default credentials for the administrative account in the Fighting Cock Information System. These credentials ("admin" for both username and password) are publicly disclosed and are not forced to be changed upon the first login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Default Credentials:** The system uses easily guessable and publicly known credentials for the admin account.
- **Lack of Forced Password Change:** The system does not require users to change the default password upon initial login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the system by using the default credentials.
- **Complete System Control:** With administrative privileges, an attacker can manipulate data, modify system settings, and potentially compromise the entire application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The system is accessible remotely, allowing attackers to exploit the vulnerability from anywhere with network access.
- **Publicly Disclosed Credentials:** The default username and password are known, making exploitation trivial for anyone aware of the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web application.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker must know the default username and password ("admin/admin"), which are publicly available.

**Summary:**
The Fighting Cock Information System is vulnerable due to its use of default administrative credentials and lack of enforced password changes. This allows any attacker with network access and knowledge of the default credentials to gain complete control over the system. The vulnerability is easily exploited and presents a significant security risk.
