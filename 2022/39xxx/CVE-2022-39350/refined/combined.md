# Markdown's XSS Vulnerability (and how to mitigate it)

## Introduction

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a well known technique to gain access to private information of the users of a website. The attacker injects spurious HTML content (a script) on the web page which will read the user’s cookies and do something bad with it (like steal credentials). As a countermeasure, you should filter any suspicious content coming from user input. Showdown doesn’t include an XSS filter, so you must provide your own. But be careful in how you do it…

## Markdown is inherently unsafe

Markdown syntax allows for arbitrary HTML to be included. For instance, this is perfectly valid markdown:

```
This is a regular paragraph.

<table>
    <tr><td>Foo</td></tr>
</table>

This is another regular paragraph.
```

This means a malicious user could do something like this:

```
This is a regular paragraph.

<script>alert('xss');</script>

This is another regular paragraph.
```

While `alert('xss');` is hardly problematic (maybe just annoying) a real scenario might be a lot worse. Obviously, this kind of straightforward attack can be easily prevented. For instance, Showdown could provide some kind of whitelist where only certain HTML tags are allowed. However, this can be easily circumvented...

## Whitelist / Blacklist can't prevent XSS

Consider the following markdown content:

```
hello <a href="www.google.com">*you*</a>
```

As you see, it's a link, nothing really malicious about this. And `<a>` tags are pretty innocuous right? Showdown should definitely allow `<a>` tags. What if the content is altered slightly, like this:

```
hello <a name="n" href="javascript:alert('xss')">*you*</a>
```

Now this is a lot more problematic. Once again, it's not that hard to filter Showdown's input to expunge problematic attributes (such as `href` in `<a>` tags) of scripting attacks. In fact, a regular HTML XSS prevention library will probably catch this kind of straightforward attack.

At this point you're probably thinking that the best way is to follow Stackoverflow's cue and simply disallow embedded HTML in markdown. Well, unfortunately it's not enough.

## Striping HTML tags is not enough

Consider the following markdown input:

```
[some text](javascript:alert('xss'))
```

Showdown will correctly parse this piece of markdown input as:

```
<a href="javascript:alert('xss')">some text</a>
```

In this case, it was Markdown's syntax itself to create the dangerous link. No HTML XSS filter can catch this. And unless you start striping dangerous words like *javascript* (which would make this article extremely hard to write), there's nothing you can really do to filter XSS attacks from your input. Things get even harder when you tightly mix HTML with Markdown.

## Mixed HTML/Markdown XSS attack

Consider the following piece of markdown:

```
> hello <a name="n"
> href="javascript:alert('xss')">*you*</a>
```

If we apply a XSS filter to this Markdown input to filter bad HTML, the XSS filter, expecting HTML, will likely think the `<a>` tag ends with the first character on the second line and will leave the text snippet untouched. It will probably fail to see that the `href="javascript:…"` thing is part of the `<a>` element and leave it alone. But when Markdown converts this to HTML, you get this:

```
<blockquote>
 <p>hello <a name="n"
 href="javascript:alert('xss')"><em>you</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
```

After parsing with Markdown, the first > on the second line disappears because it is used as the blockquote marker in the Markdown blockquote syntax, and now you’ve got a link containing an XSS attack!

Did Markdown generate the HTML? No, the HTML was already in plain sight in the input. The XSS filter couldn’t catch it because the input doesn’t follow HTML’s rules: it’s a mix of Markdown and HTML and the filter doesn’t know a dime about Markdown.

## Mitigating XSS

So, is it all lost? Not really. The answer is not to filter the *input*, but rather the *output*. After the *input* text is converted into full fledged HTML, you can then reliably apply the correct XSS filters to remove any dangerous or malicious content.

Also, client-side validations are not reliable. This should be a given, but in case you're wondering, you should (almost) never trust data sent by the client. If there's some critical operation you must perform to the data (such as XSS filtering), it should be done *SERVER SIDE* not client side.

HTML XSS filtering libraries are useful here, since they prevent most of the attacks. However, you should not use them blindly: a library can't predict all the contexts and situation your application may face.

## Conclusion

Showdown tries to convert the input text as closely as possible, without any concerns for XSS attacks or malicious intent. So, the basic rules are:

* **removing HTML entities from markdown does not prevent XSS**. Markdown syntax can generate XSS attacks.
* **XSS filtering should be done AFTER Showdown has processed any input, not before or during**. If you filter before, it’ll break some of Markdown’s features and will leave security holes.
* **perform the necessary filtering server-side, not client side**. XSS filtering libraries are useful but shouldn't be used blindly.

**✎** Update Entry

### v4.12.0 [#](#v4-12-0)

October 01, 2024 major

**Highlights:**

* **Tags, Tags, Tags**. This release contains a breadth of tag-related features:
  + Alerts can be limited to projects with specific tags
  + Projects can be included or excluded from BOM validation using tags
  + Projects can be tagged as part of a BOM upload request
  + Tag input fields of the frontend now offer auto-complete
* **Tag Management**. It is now possible to view and manage tags in the system through the new
  *tag management* view, and associated REST API endpoints. This makes it possible to see how many,
  and which projects, policies, and alerts are associated with a given tag. Projects, policies,
  and alerts can be un-tagged, and tags can be deleted altogether.
  + *This feature was discussed and demoed in our July community meeting! Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvigQKVvoN8&t=543s)*
* **Global Policy Violation Audit View**. Analog to the *Global Vulnerability Audit View* shipped in version 4.11.0,
  this release includes a new interface to discover and filter policy violations across all projects in the portfolio.
* **Authorization for Badges**. Badges were previously not protected by authentication and authorization, and thus
  were disabled by default. With this release, unauthenticated access is deprecated. Instead, authenticating
  as a team with `VIEW_BADGES` permission is required. This can be combined with portfolio access control,
  such that a key can only access the badges of a subset of projects. Refer to the [badges documentation](/integrations/badges/) for details.
* **Modernization**. Behind the scenes, the tech stack that Dependency-Track is built on was upgraded
  to the latest and greatest. We moved from Java 17 to Java 21, from Java EE to Jakarta EE 10, from Jetty 10
  to Jetty 12, and from Swagger v2 to OpenAPI v3.

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The API server now requires Java 21 or newer. Users deploying Dependency-Track via containers
  don’t have to do anything, since those have been shipped with Java 21 since version 4.10.0.
  Users deploying Dependency-Track as JAR will need to upgrade their Java installation accordingly.
* The `/api/swagger.json` endpoint no longer exists. The REST API documentation is now available
  at `/api/openapi.json` and `/api/openapi.yaml` respectively. The documentation format follows
  the OpenAPI v3 specification, the Swagger v2 format is no longer provided.
* The `/api/v1/tag/{policyUuid}` REST API endpoint has been deprecated in favor of
  `/api/v1/tag/policy/{uuid}`. Users relying on the outdated endpoint for their custom integrations
  are encouraged to migrate to the new endpoint.
* The legacy BOM processing logic was removed. The *BOM Processing V2* option introduced in v4.11 is now the default
  and the only available option. To gauge the impact of this change, consider enabling the experimental option in
  an existing v4.11 deployment first.
* Deletion of tags requires the new `TAG_MANAGEMENT` permission. The permission is *not* added to existing
  users or teams automatically. Administrators should assign it to users and teams as needed.
* Accessing badges requires the new `VIEW_BADGES` permission. The permission is *not* added to existing
  users or teams automatically. Administrators should assign it to users and teams as needed.
* Unauthenticated access to badges is *deprecated* and will be fully removed in v4.13.
* To support serving of the frontend from custom paths ([frontend/#801](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/pull/801)), frontend containers can currently not
  function with a read-only filesystem (as commonly used in Kubernetes environments). Refer to [frontend/#940](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/issues/940) for details.

**✎** Update Entry

### v4.11.5 [#](#v4-11-5)

July 08, 2024 patch

This release primarily addresses an inability to mirror the NVD via its REST API. The NVD REST API recently experienced
increased load, causing service disruptions. Dependency-Track users who opted into API mirroring will have seen
symptoms of this as `NvdApiException: NVD Returned Status Code: 503` errors in the logs.

To reduce load on their systems, [NIST started to block](https://github.com/jeremylong/Open-Vulnerability-Project/issues/184#issuecomment-2214217254)
requests with a certain `User-Agent` header, which Dependency-Track happens to use. Upgrading to v4.11.5
will allow Dependency-Track to no longer be subject to this block.

Users who can’t immediately update, yet are reliant on NVD data being current, can switch back to the
feed file based mirroring by disabling *Enable mirroring via API* in the administration panel.

**Fixes:**

* Fix broken NVD mirroring via REST API - [apiserver/#3940](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/3940)
* Fix BOM processing V2 dispatching `BOM_CONSUMED` and `BOM_PROCESSED` notification with scope `SYSTEM` instead of `PORTFOLIO` - [apiserver/#3941](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/3941)
* Fix BOM export producing invalid CycloneDX for custom licenses - [apiserver/#3942](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/3942)

* [API server milestone 4.11.5](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/milestone/42?closed=1)
* [Frontend milestone 4.11.5](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/milestone/27?closed=1)

**✎** Update Entry

### v4.11.0 [#](#v4-11-0)

May 07, 2024 major

**Highlights:**

* **Optimized BOM Ingestion**. The logic that governs how uploaded BOMs are processed and ingested into Dependency-Track has been
  overhauled to be more reliable and efficient. Further, BOM processing is now an atomic operation, such that errors
  occurring midway do not cause a partial state to be left behind. De-duplication of components and services is more
  predictable, and log messages emitted during processing contain additional context, making them easier to correlate.
  Because the new implementation can have a big impact on how Dependency-Track behaves regarding BOM uploads,
  it is disabled by default for this release. It may be enabled in the administration panel under
  *Configuration* -> *Experimental*.
* **BOM Validation**. Historically, Dependency-Track did not validate uploaded BOMs and VEXs against the CycloneDX
  schema. While this allowed BOMs to be processed that did not strictly adhere to the schema, it could also lead to confusion
  when uploaded files were accepted, but then failed to be ingested during asynchronous processing. Starting with this
  release, uploaded files will be rejected if they fail schema validation. Note that this may reveal issues in BOM
  generators that currently produce invalid CycloneDX documents. Validation may be turned off in the
  administration panel under *Configuration* -> *BOM Formats*.
  + *This feature was demoed in our April community meeting! Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iIeajRJK8o&t=450s)*
* **Global Vulnerability Audit View**. This new interface allows users to discover and filter vulnerabilities that affect
  their portfolio, across all projects. When portfolio access control is enabled, this view is limited to projects a user
  has explicit access to. It is possible to inspect individual findings, or aggregates grouped by vulnerability,
  making it possible to spot the most prevalent vulnerabilities.
  + *This feature was demoed in our April community meeting! Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iIeajRJK8o&t=572s).*
* **Trivy Analyzer Integration**. It is now possible to leverage [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) in [server mode](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.50/docs/references/modes/client-server/) for vulnerability analysis.
  + Refer to the [analyzer’s documentation](/datasources/trivy/) for further details,
    in particular the [known limitations](/datasources/trivy/#known-limitations).
  + *This feature was demoed in our April community meeting! Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iIeajRJK8o&t=725s).*
* **Extended Localization**. The UI now supports 12 additional languages. Users can change their language preference
  in their profile settings. While the Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish translations were provided by a native speaker
  (thanks [@fnxpt](https://github.com/fnxpt)!), the majority of languages are currently machine-translated. Translation improvements are a great
  way to contribute to the project, please find additional details [here](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend?tab=readme-ov-file#internationalization-i18n).
* **Official Helm Chart**. The Dependency-Track project now offers an official Helm chart for Kubernetes deployments.
  Community input and contributions are highly requested. The chart repository can be found at
  <https://github.com/DependencyTrack/helm-charts>.
  It is also available through [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dependencytrack/dependency-track).

**Upgrade Notes:**

* To enable the optimized BOM ingestion, toggle the *BOM Processing V2* option in the administration panel
  under *Configuration* -> *Experimental*
* Validation of uploaded BOMs and VEXs is enabled per default, but can be disabled in the administration panel
  under *Configuration* -> *BOM Formats* -> *BOM Validation*
* The `CWE` table is dropped automatically upon upgrade, it has been unused since v4.5
* The default logging configuration ([logback.xml](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/blob/master/src/main/docker/logback.xml)) was updated to include the [Mapped Diagnostic Context](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html) (MDC)
  + Users who [customized their logging configuration](/getting-started/monitoring/#custom-logging-configuration) are recommended to follow this change
* Severities of vulnerabilities that previously had `NULL` severities in the database will be computed
  and updated automatically upon upgrade, based on CVSSv2, CVSSv3, and OWASP Risk Rating scores
  + Database updates are batched, the entire procedure should complete 30s to 1min
* The following configuration properties were renamed:
  + `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration` → `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`
  + `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.multiplier` → `snyk.retry.backoff.multiplier`
  + `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.initial.duration.seconds` → `snyk.retry.backoff.initial.duration.ms`
  + `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.max.duration.seconds` → `snyk.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`
* Configuration properties for retry durations are now specified in milliseconds instead of seconds
* The following default values for configuration properties have changed:
  + `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`: 600000ms (10min) → 60000ms (1min)
* The `name` tag of the `resilience4j_retry_calls_total` for OSS Index has changed from `ossIndexRetryer` to `ossindex-api`
* The types of the following columns are changed from `VARCHAR(255)` to `VARCHAR(786)` automatically upon upgrade:
  + `COMPONENT.PURL`
  + `COMPONENT.PURLCOORDINATES`
  + `COMPONENTANALYSISCACHE.TARGET`
  + `PROJECT.PURL`

**✎** Update Entry

### v4.10.0 [#](#v4-10-0)

December 08, 2023 major

Dependency-Track has historically relied on file-based data feeds to mirror contents of the National Vulnerability
Database (NVD). These feeds are being [retired on December 15th 2023](https://nvd.nist.gov/General/News/change-timeline),
although they [may be available up until December 18th](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/nvd-news/c/a4bDL8nofOk).

As a consequence, this release includes support for mirroring the NVD via its REST API instead. This integration
will be optional for Dependency-Track v4.10, but mandatory for later releases. Users are encouraged to enable
REST API mirroring now, to ensure a smooth transition. Refer to the [NVD datasource documentation](/datasources/nvd/#mirroring-via-nvd-rest-api) to learn more.

**Features:**

* Add support for mirroring the NVD via its REST API - [apiserver/#3175](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/3175)

* Fix notification level not being modifiable for existing alerts - [frontend/#661](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/pull/661)

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The `CPE` table is no longer needed and will be dropped automatically upon upgrade - [apiserver/#3117](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/3117)
* A warning will be logged when mirroring the NVD through its legacy data feeds
  + Refer to the [NVD datasource documentation](/datasources/nvd/#mirroring-via-nvd-rest-api) to learn how to switch to API-based mirroring
* As the Grafana dashboard is not managed by Dependency-Track, users wishing to update it will need
  to re-import it into their Grafana instance.

**Upgrade Notes:**

* API keys generated after the upgrade will be prefixed with `odt_`. Existing API keys without this prefix will
  continue to work. The prefix is configurable via `alpine.api.key.prefix`, although customization is not recommended.
  Refer to [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration/) for details.
* Users ingesting SBOMs with CPE data may notice an uptick in vulnerabilities being identified by the internal analyzer.
  This is expected as a result of [apiserver/#2988](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/2988) being fixed. If newly identified vulnerabilities turn out to be largely
  false positives, let the project team know by [reporting a defect](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/new?assignees=&labels=defect%2Cin+triage&projects=&template=defect-report.yml).

### v4.8.0 [#](#v4-8-0)

April 18, 2023 major

**Celebrating 10 years of OWASP Dependency-Track**

Dependency-Track is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year!

Read the announcement from Steve Springett, creator of Dependency-Track, on [the OWASP blog](https://owasp.org/blog/2023/01/10/Celebrating-10-years-of-Dependency-Track.html).

**Highlights:**

* **Improved frontend UX**.
  + Navigating through the UI, switching tabs etc. now properly updates the URL in the browser.
    This makes it possible to share links to specific pages with others, and not lose context entirely when using the browser’s
    “go back” functionality.
  + Criteria for the component search is now encoded in the URL, which allows “deep-linking” to searches, making it easier
    to collaborate with colleagues.
  + The UI will now remember various user preferences, i.e. selected columns, numbers of search results per page,
    whether to show inactive projects, and much more.
  + The dependency graph now optionally displays indicator icons for outdated components.
* **Polished policy engine.** The policy engine received lots of love in this release, ranging from various bugfixes,
  to newly supported policy conditions.
* **Reduced resource footprint for vulnerability database mirroring**. Downloading and processing vulnerability
  data from the NVD, GitHub, and OSV has historically been a heavy task that could cause large spikes in JVM heap usage.
  Due to various improvements, mirroring will now be faster, and a lot more lightweight (see [apiserver/#2575](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/2575) for
  comparisons).

**✎** Update Entry

### v4.7.0 [#](#v4-7-0)

December 16, 2022 major

**Highlights:**

* **Hierarchical Project Relationships**. Projects can now be organized in hierarchies, using simple
  parent-child-relationships. Hierarchies are visualized in the UI, and allow projects to inherit various
  configurations from their parent, including notification rules and applicable policies.
* **Improved Dependency Graph**. The dependency graph can now be displayed in its entirety. Previously, the depth was
  limited to only three levels. Additionally, it’s now possible to navigate from a specific component (e.g. from the
  *Audit Vulnerabilities* tab) directly to the dependency graph. In doing so, Dependency-Track will show all paths in
  the graph leading up to this component, making it easy to understand how a given component is introduced to the project.
* **Snyk Integration (Beta)**. Dependency-Track can now make use of [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to scan and continuously monitor components
  for vulnerabilities. This provides access to Snyk’s proprietary vulnerability database, maintained by their dedicated
  research team. The Snyk integration requires a paid subscription with REST API access.
* **Jira Integration**. It is now possible to publish notifications to Jira, making it easier to integrate events that
  require action to be taken into existing Jira workflows.

  `HikariPool-4` to `transactional` and `non-transactional` ([apiserver/#2238](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/2238)). Users monitoring those pools are advised
  to update their monitoring configuration accordingly (e.g. Grafana dashboards).
* Distribution of the API server SBOM in XML format has been dropped ([apiserver/#2175](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/2175)).
  Users consuming the API server BOM in XML format should migrate to consuming the JSON-formatted BOM instead.

### v4.6.0 [#](#v4-6-0)

October 11, 2022 major

**Highlights:**

* **Vulnerability Aliases**. By ingesting data from multiple sources of vulnerability intelligence,
  there will be cases where different advisories describe the same vulnerability.
  For example, [CVE-2022-31197](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31197) and
  [GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2) describe the same defect,
  yet their descriptions and risk ratings differ. Dependency-Track 4.6 now recognizes when multiple advisories alias each other,
  and includes this information in notifications and REST API responses. Aliases will additionally be considered when
  calculating portfolio metrics, so that duplicate vulnerabilities do not skyrocket the risk scoring.
  Further improvements to aliases will be coming in future releases.
* **OSV Integration (Beta)**. Dependency-Track now optionally mirrors vulnerability intelligence data from the Open Source
  Vulnerabilities database ([OSV](https://osv.dev/)). OSV normalizes and enriches data from multiple other
  vulnerability databases. Mirroring can be limited to a configurable selection of ecosystems.
* **New Policy Conditions**.
  + Using the tag condition, policies can be restricted to projects with certain properties or priorities (e.g. *high-risk*, *internet-facing*, etc.)
  + Using the CWE condition, policies can assist in prioritizing findings of certain weaknesses
  + Using the component hash condition, policies can be used to flag usage of malicious or tainted packages
* **Performance**. Various improvements, most prominently regarding metrics updates.
  Organizations, especially those with large portfolios of multiple thousands of projects, will see a drastic reduction
  in runtime and resource usage.
* **Observability**. By exposition of system metrics via the Prometheus text-based format, operators can now monitor
  their instances using Prometheus, Grafana, or other compatible observability stacks. Metrics exposition is optional
  and must be enabled, refer to the [monitoring](/getting-started/monitoring/) documentation for details.
* **Customization**. Users with advanced customization needs can now create and modify notification templates,
  as well as specify custom intervals for recurring tasks. Refer to the [notifications](/integrations/notifications/) and [recurring tasks](/getting-started/recurring-tasks/)
  documentation for details.
* **Authentication for Internal Repositories**. Dependency-Track can now authenticate with artifact repositories
  like Nexus Repository Manager or Artifactory to fetch information about internal artifacts.

**Features:**

* Added support for authentication with internal package repositories - [#881](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/881)

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The new baseline Java version is 17 ([#1804](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/1804))
  + Java versions later than 17 may work as well, but haven’t been tested
  + Users deploying DT via [executable WAR](/getting-started/deploy-exewar/) will need to upgrade Java accordingly
  + Users deploying DT via [containers](/getting-started/deploy-docker/) don’t need to do anything
* The embedded H2 database has been upgraded to major version 2
  + Manual upgrade steps are required, refer to the [H2 v2 migration guide](/getting-started/database-support/#migrating-to-h2-v2)
  + **Without the manual migration, Dependency-Track 4.6 will not work with H2 databases created by earlier versions**
  + **Reminder**: H2 is not, and never has been, supported for production usage
* With [#1429](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1429), handling of notification levels has changed
  + Previously, an alert with level `ERROR` would trigger on notifications with levels `ERROR`, `WARNING`, and `INFORMATIONAL`
  + Now, an alert with level `ERROR` will only trigger on notifications with level `ERROR`
  + An alert with level `WARNING` will trigger on notifications with level `WARNING` and `ERROR` etc.
  + The new behavior is similar to how structured logging libraries work
  + This change primarily affects notifications of the `SYSTEM` scope, which are used to report statuses of various tasks, e.g. `DATASOURCE_MIRRORING`
  + Notifications in the `PORTFOLIO` scope (e.g. `NEW_VULNERABILITY`) all have the `INFORMATIONAL` level
  + Users who configured alerts with scope `PORTFOLIO` and level `ERROR` should change the level to `INFORMATIONAL` after the upgrade

**✎** Update Entry

### v4.3.0 [#](#v4-3-0)

August 02, 2021 major

**Features:**

* Implemented Portfolio Access Control (beta) - [#140](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/140)
* OpenID Connect: Source user claims from `/userinfo` *and* ID token - [#1008](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/140)
  + Resolves an issue where some IdPs would provide specific claims only in one and not the other of the two
* Added Go Modules repository support
* Added timeout for idle transactions - [#941](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/941)
* Components with missing or unknown license are now evaluated against policy condition - [#1105](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1105)

**Fixes:**

* Resolved issue where active projects could only be displayed when showing inactive projects - [#963](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/963)
* Resolved high load issues with Postgres while simultaneously increasing performance for all database platforms - [#1026](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1026)
* Resolved issue with OSS Index where PURLs without a version will lead to scan failure - [#1115](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1115)

**Security:**

Portfolio ACL logic has been implemented. In its current form, Portfolio Access Control is a beta feature in v4.3. As a result, the project will not treat bypass or absent ACL logic as a security defect. There are a few known gaps in ACL logic that will exist in v4.3. These gaps are tracked in [#1127](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1127).

ACL logic covers:

* /v1/bom/\*
  + Uploading SBOMs to projects or exporting SBOMs from projects or components
* v1/component/\*
  + CRUD operations on components
* /v1/finding/\*
  + Security findings for projects and components
* /v1/metrics/\*
  + Project and component metrics
* /v1/project/\*
  + \_RUD operations on projects
* /v1/service/\*
  + CRUD operations on components
* /v1/violation/\*
  + Project and component policy violations
* /v1/vulnerability/\*
  + CRUD operations on vulnerable projects or components

The user interface clearly states that Portfolio Access Control is beta. By default, Portfolio Access Control is disabled.

**Upgrade Notes:**

* OpenID Connect: The client ID of the frontend has to be passed to the API server via the `alpine.oidc.client.id` property
  + Required for the API server to be able to validate ID tokens. Refer to the [OIDC documentation](/getting-started/openidconnect-configuration/) for details.
* Removed legacy support for SPDX (RDF and tag/value) - [#1053](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1053)
* Removed legacy support for the traditional WAR (was previously deprecated and unsupported) - [#1070](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1070)

**✎** Update Entry

### v4.0.0 [#](#v4-0-0)

January 03, 2021 major

**Features:**

* Flexible, project-centric data model
* Added policy engine, configurable policies, policy evaluation, and auditing workflow
* Added default license groups
* Anonymous access to Sonatype OSS Index is now enabled by default
* Component vulnerabilities are now attributed to the analyzers responsible for finding them

* Added component support for Blake2b and Blake3 hash algorithms
* Added component support for SWID Tag ID
* Projects now have identity, similar to components, and support coordinates (group, name, version), CPE, Package URL, and SWID Tag ID
* Added support for firmware and container component types
* When generating a CycloneDX BOM from a project or component, v1.2 of the spec is now produced
* Updated SPDX license list to v3.11
* Dropped support for NVD JSON v1.0 data feeds

* Fixed failure on mail notifications when multiple addresses were configured
* Fixed container healthcheck to specify use of no-proxy
* Fixed issue where component descriptions in a BOM were not being saved

**Security:**

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The Dependency-Track v4 data model is incompatible with previous releases. As a result, it is not possible to simply upgrade as with previous versions. A data migration is required to update from 3.8 to 4.0. The migration is a standalone set of scripts that must be executed against the database in order to migrate the data to the new model. Refer to the official [v3.8.0 to v4.0.0 Migration Project](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/v3.8.0-v4.0.0-migration) for more information.
* Four Dependency-Track distribution variants are provided. Refer to [Distributions](/getting-started/distributions/) for details.
* The traditional WAR distribution is deprecated and no longer supported. It is still being produced as of this release but will be discontinued in a future release.
* Docker images have been moved from the OWASP organization on Docker Hub to a dedicated [Dependency-Track organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/dependencytrack).
* The FrontEnd requires deployment to the root (“/”) context. Deploying to any context other than root is no longer supported.
* Some APIs have changed as of this release. APIs that were specific to the global component model have been removed. APIs that referenced a ‘dependency’ in the model have changed. Components are now assigned directly to projects themselves, thus eliminating the need for ‘dependency’ objects in v4.
* The MySQL Connector distributed with the Docker image has been updated to version 8.0.22. When using MySQL, `ALPINE_DATABASE_DRIVER_PATH` has to be set to `/extlib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar`. Note that `ALPINE_DATABASE_DRIVER` may need to be updated as well. Refer to the [official upgrading instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-upgrading-to-8.0.html).
* The Postgres driver distributed with the Docker image has been updated to version 42.2.18. When using Postgres, `ALPINE_DATABASE_DRIVER_PATH` has to be set to `/extlib/postgresql-42.2.18.jar`.

### v3.8.0 [#](#v3-8-0)

March 22, 2020 major

**Bundled frontend: [v1.0.0](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/releases/tag/1.0.0)**

**Features:**

* New user interface based on Vue.js and Bootstrap.
* User interface can optionally be deployed and upgraded independently of the Dependency-Track server.
* Package repositories are now configurable.
* Package repositories can now be identified as ‘internal’. Components identified as ‘internal’ will be analyzed using internal repositories.
* Added additional logging and notifications for OSS Index and NPM Audit analyzers.
* Added the ability to publish system notifications when vulnerability analyzers encounter communication or other errors.
* Added several occurrences of counts for various items throughout the UI.

**Fixes:**

* Corrected the percentage value of findings audited.
* Fixed URL to Maven Central which prevented the MavenMetaAnalyzer from retrieving component metadata.
* Changed logging behavior when internal components are identified.
* Improved accuracy of internal CPE analyzer which may have lead to false negatives in some situations.
* Fixed issue where the CPE value defined in a BOM was not being persisted if the component previously existed.
* Fixed issue which prevented the HexMetaAnalyzer from executing preventing it from retrieving component metadata for Erlang or Elixir components.

**Security:**

* All Dependency-Track server releases now include a complete CycloneDX software bill-of-materials.
* Added missing permission checks to repository API endpoints.

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The `nist` and `index` directories inside the Dependency-Track data directory will be deleted upon upgrade. This will force the NVD to be downloaded and reprocessed and the indexes to be rebuilt.
* The internal vulnerable software dictionary, generated automatically from the NVD, will be wiped upon upgrade. This will take several minutes to complete and should not be interrupted.

some existing LDAP configuration properties have been changed.

```
# This property has been removed
alpine.ldap.domain

```

```
# This property now refers to the users DN
alpine.ldap.bind.username

```

```
# Format now applies only to the value of alpine.ldap.attribute.name.
# Examples have been modified. A users DN is no longer a valid format.
alpine.ldap.auth.username.format

```

```
# New properties
alpine.ldap.groups.filter
alpine.ldap.user.groups.filter
alpine.ldap.user.provisioning
alpine.ldap.team.synchronization

```

**✎** Update Entry

### v3.2.1 [#](#v3-2-1)

September 21, 2018 minor

**Features:**

* The NSP Advisory API has been removed and replaced with the NPM Public Advisory API

**Fixes:**

* Processing and permission corrections to new multi-part BOM upload API
* UI corrections for vulnerabilities with unassigned severity
* Fixes for displaying and processing of vulnerabilities without CVSS scores
* Minor changes to severity colour scheme

**Upgrade Notes:**

All previous NSP vulnerabilities will automatically be migrated to NPM vulnerabilities. No additional
action is required. Unlike NSP vulnerabilities, NPM does not provide CVSS scores or vectors. Therefore
all NPM vulnerabilities will no longer display the CVSS vector, or the base, impact, or exploitability
scores and corresponding chart data.

**✎** Update Entry

### v3.2.0 [#](#v3-2-0)

September 06, 2018 major

**Features:**

  ability to dynamically create projects (without providing them full PORTFOLIO\_MANAGEMENT permission)
  will need this permission added to their account or through their team membership.
* The SYSTEM\_CONFIGURATION permission was introduced in this release. Existing administrative users that
  need the ability to perform more general purpose system configurations need to add this permission to their
  accounts.
* Upgrades to v3.2.0 can be successfully performed from systems running v3.1.x. If a previous
  version is being used, an upgrade to 3.1.x is required prior to upgrading to v3.2.0.

# Persistent Cross-Site-Scripting via Vulnerability Details

Moderate

[nscuro](/nscuro)
published
GHSA-c33w-pm52-mqvf
Oct 24, 2022

## Package

npm

@dependencytrack/frontend
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 4.6.1

## Patched versions

4.6.1

## Description

### Description

Due to the common practice of providing vulnerability details in markdown format, the Dependency-Track frontend renders them using the JavaScript library [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown). Showdown [does not have any XSS countermeasures built in](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Markdown%27s-XSS-Vulnerability-%28and-how-to-mitigate-it%29), and versions before 4.6.1 of the Dependency-Track frontend did not encode or sanitize Showdown's output. This made it possible for arbitrary JavaScript included in vulnerability details via HTML attributes to be executed in context of the frontend.

### Impact

Actors with the `VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT` permission can exploit this weakness by creating or editing a custom vulnerability and providing XSS payloads in any of the following fields:

* Description
* Details
* Recommendation
* References

The payload will be executed for users with the `VIEW_PORTFOLIO` permission when browsing to the modified vulnerability's page, for example:

```
https://dtrack.example.com/vulnerabilities/INTERNAL/INT-jd8u-e8tl-8lwu

```

Alternatively, malicious JavaScript could be introduced via any of the vulnerability databases mirrored by Dependency-Track (NVD, GitHub Advisories, OSV, OSS Index, VulnDB). However, this attack vector is highly unlikely, and the team is not aware of any occurrence of this happening.

> **Note**
>
> The *Vulnerability Details* element of the *Audit Vulnerabilities* tab in the project view is **not** affected.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in frontend version 4.6.1.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
