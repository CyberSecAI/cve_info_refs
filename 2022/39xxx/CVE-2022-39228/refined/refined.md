Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-39228

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an observable discrepancy in the response behavior of the vantage6 application when handling failed login attempts. While the application aims to conceal the existence of user accounts by not explicitly stating if a username exists, it inadvertently reveals this information through account blocking. If an attacker tries to log in with a valid username and incorrect password multiple times, the account gets blocked and the user receives a notification email, which allows the attacker to confirm valid usernames on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the information disclosure vulnerability. Although the system does not reveal user existence through direct error messages, account blocking reveals if a username is valid.
- **Lack of consistent response:** The system is inconsistent on how it handles invalid usernames and invalid passwords for existing usernames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can use this vulnerability to enumerate valid usernames within the vantage6 system by repeatedly attempting login with incorrect passwords. This enables them to narrow their target list of users for future attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login mechanism of the vantage6 application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to make login requests to the vantage6 application. This could be from an external network or internal to the network where the application is hosted.
- No specific privilege is required other than the ability to access the login interface.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is related to the password policies described in issue #59, which includes the prevention of username enumeration. The vulnerability is in contradiction with the goal of not revealing existing usernames.
- The fix included sending email notifications to the user that their account is blocked, informing the user about the block, which was triggered by multiple failed login attempts
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-36gx-9q6h-g429.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.8.0 of vantage6.
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy).
