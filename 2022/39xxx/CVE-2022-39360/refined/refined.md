Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that Metabase allowed password resets for users who were configured to use Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication. This bypasses the intended authentication flow through the SSO Identity Provider (IdP).

**Weaknesses:**

*   **CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication:** The system lacked a critical check to prevent password reset for SSO users.
*   **Inconsistent Authentication Enforcement:** The system incorrectly allowed password reset functionality for users whose authentication was meant to be handled exclusively by an external SSO IdP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvention of SSO:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to a Metabase account by resetting the password, completely bypassing the intended SSO authentication mechanism.
*   **Account Takeover:**  Successful password reset could lead to unauthorized access to the user's Metabase account and the sensitive data it contains.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Password Reset Functionality:** The primary attack vector is the password reset functionality within Metabase itself.
*   **Email Interaction:**  An attacker could trigger the password reset process using the email address associated with a Metabase SSO user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Email Address:** The attacker needs a valid email address associated with a Metabase user that utilizes SSO.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Metabase instance to initiate the password reset process.
*   **No Existing Password Required:** The attacker does not need to know the existing password of the targeted account

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Metabase versions prior to 0.44.5, 0.43.7, 0.42.6 and 0.41.9 are vulnerable. Both the OSS and Enterprise versions are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** Versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9 and greater contain the fix.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix blocks password reset functionality for SSO users by checking if the user has `google-auth?`, `ldap-auth?` or `sso-source` enabled and preventing password reset token generation. The password reset email is modified to indicate that users should use SSO to login.
*  The fix is associated with commit `edadf7303c3b068609f57ca073e67885d5c98730`
