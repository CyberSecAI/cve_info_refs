  "response": {
    "match": true,
    "data": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `ghinstallation` library, when encountering a failure while refreshing an installation token, would return the full HTTP request and response for debugging purposes. This response inadvertently included the bearer JWT for the GitHub App.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The primary weakness is the inclusion of sensitive information (the JWT) in error responses.",
        "CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information"
      ],
      "impact": "Exposure of the GitHub App's JWT, albeit short-lived, could potentially allow an attacker to make unauthorized API requests to GitHub.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a request to refresh an installation token fails. An attacker with access to the error response can obtain the JWT. The CVSS score lists the attack vector as local, complexity high, and privileges required as low with user interaction.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or view the error response when a token refresh fails, and they need to understand how to use the JWT to interact with the Github API"
