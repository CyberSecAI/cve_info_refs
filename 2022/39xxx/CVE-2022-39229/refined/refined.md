      "Root cause of vulnerability": "In Grafana, a user’s username and email address are unique fields. A user can register with an email address as a username. Grafana login allows users to sign in with either username or email address. This creates a scenario where user_1 can register with an email address and user_2 can register their username as user_1’s email address. As a result, user_1 would be prevented to sign in Grafana, since user_1 password won’t match with users_2 email address.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authentication due to lack of proper validation of usernames and email addresses, allowing a user to claim another user's email as a username, thereby preventing the original user from logging in.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service for the user whose email address is used as a username by another user, preventing the original user from logging in.",
      "Attack vectors": "Network access to the Grafana login interface.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to register a new user account, knowing the victim's email address."

        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authentication and lack of uniqueness check for usernames and email addresses during user registration and login.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service; A user can be locked out of their account if another user registers with their email address as a username.",
