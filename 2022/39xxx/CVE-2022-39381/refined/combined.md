| Hi Gal,  We are using Node.js, It is crashing when we trying to process some PDFs. I have attached the sample for reference. We are getting the following error  ``` " Unable to create form xobject from PDF page, parhaps the page index does not fit the total pages count "   ```  After this error, When we try to end the PDF writer then the system crashing. I have tested in both Linux and Windows.  Here is the sample code  ``` var pdfReader = hummus.createReader(src); var pageCount = pdfReader.getPagesCount(); var pdfWriter = hummus.createWriter(dest, { version: hummus.ePDFVersion13 }); var cpyCxt = pdfWriter.createPDFCopyingContext(pdfReader); for(var i=0;i<pdfReader.getPagesCount(); i++){ 	var formID = cpyCxt.createFormXObjectFromPDFPage(i, hummus.ePDFPageBoxMediaBox); 	............. 	............. } pdfWriter.end(); [Sample.pdf](https://github.com/galkahana/HummusJS/files/2104945/Sample.pdf)   ```  Please let me know how to handle this exception?  Thanks, Anil. |

| We are experience the same issue -- we are attempting to read a PDF using createREader() (using PDFRStreamForBuffer) and if the PDF is corrupt, the call simply crashes Node.js. Is there a workaround? Is there a hummus method that will peek into a PDF and determine if it is valid or if it is corrupt? |

## Package

npm

hummus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.0.111

## Patched versions

1.0.111

npm

muhammara
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

< 2.6.0

None

## Description

### Impact

The package muhammara before 2.6.0; all versions of package hummus are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when supplied with a maliciously crafted PDF file to be appended to another.

### Patches

It has been patched in 2.6.0 for muhammara and not at all for hummus

### Workarounds

Do not process files from untrusted sources

### References

PR: [#194](https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS/pull/194)

Issue: [#191](https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS/issues/191)

Issue in hummus: [galkahana/HummusJS#293](https://github.com/galkahana/HummusJS/issues/293)

### Outline differences to <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25892>

The difference is one is in [src/deps/PDFWriter/PDFParser.cpp](https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS/commit/1890fb555eaf171db79b73fdc3ea543bbd63c002#diff-09ac2c64aeab42b14b2ae7b11a5648314286986f8c8444a5b3739ba7203b1e9b) and the other is [PDFDocumentHandler.cpp](https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS/pull/194/files#diff-38d338ea4c047fd7dd9a05b5ffe7c964f0fa7e79aff4c307ccee7596457b1ef2) both is a null pointer but for different cases

These are totally diffent issues, one is in reading a pdf the other is in appendending a maliciously crafted one. The function calls are different the versions in which they are solved are diffent.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
