- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing specially crafted X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered when the application reads maliciously crafted X_T files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious X_T file with the affected application.
