Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insecure deserialization of JSON payloads when the `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` environment variable is explicitly set to `object`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `object` mode in the `Oj` library for Ruby allows the deserialization of arbitrary Ruby objects from JSON, which can lead to remote code execution.
- The vulnerability is present in Fluentd versions 1.13.2 and later that utilize this option.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE). An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running Fluentd by sending a specially crafted JSON payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted JSON payloads to a Fluentd instance that has `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` set to `object`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Fluentd instance.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send JSON payloads to Fluentd.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a non-default configuration, i.e., the `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` must be explicitly set to `object`.
- The vulnerable option (`object`) was introduced in Fluentd version 1.13.2.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to remove the `object` option as a valid value for `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE`.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSL-2022-067.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
