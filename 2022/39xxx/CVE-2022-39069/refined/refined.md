**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-39069

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to a lack of input verification by the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
* An attacker could cause the leakage of the current table content.

**Attack vectors:**
* The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by building malicious requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable server. The vulnerability is described as having a "Physical" attack vector (AV:P), which suggests the attacker needs local access to the affected device, but this seems inconsistent with the description of malicious requests.
