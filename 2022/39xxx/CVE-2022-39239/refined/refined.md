Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the source image domain, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended allowlist. This, combined with improper handling of headers, enables the loading of arbitrary images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application fetches images from attacker-controlled URLs, bypassing the intended domain allowlist.
* **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By loading a malicious SVG containing embedded scripts and caching it, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the browser context of users who later access the cached image.
* **Cache poisoning:** The response is cached globally, impacting all users after the initial exploit.
* **Improper Host Validation:** The application does not properly validate the host specified in the header.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Image Loading:** Attackers can force the server to load and serve images from any URL, including those under their control.
* **XSS:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable application through malicious SVG images. This could allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.
* **Cache Poisoning:** Once exploited, the malicious image is cached globally, serving the malicious content to all users until the cache is cleared.

**Attack vectors:**
* **Specially crafted headers:** Attackers manipulate headers to bypass the domain allowlist.
* **Malicious SVG images:** The vulnerability is exploited using SVG images containing malicious scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with modified headers to the vulnerable server.
* The attacker must be able to host or control a server containing malicious SVG files.
