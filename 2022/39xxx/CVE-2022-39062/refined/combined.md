SUMMARY

SICAM TOOLBOX II contains two vulnerabilities that could allow local attackers to execute code on the
system with elevated privileges.

Siemens has released an update for SICAM TOOLBOX II and recommends to update to the latest version.

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Ensure that only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the conﬁguration of additional

local accounts

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue
of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the
corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by
the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may
be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied,
and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security
measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g.
ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to our operational
guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM TOOLBOX II is an engineering solution for plants and systems of all sizes. It allows data collection,
data modeling, conﬁguration, and parameterization. It is used for engineering of process information for
the automation and central control-room systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-39062

Affected applications do not properly set permissions for product folders. This could allow an authenti-
cated attacker with low privileges to replace DLLs and conduct a privilege escalation.

CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource

Vulnerability CVE-2023-38641

The affected application’s database service is executed as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This could allow a
local attacker to execute operating system commands with elevated privileges.
