{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `initializer` modifier in OpenZeppelin contracts did not prevent reentrancy when initialization is invoked separately from contract creation, specifically in scenarios using minimal proxies. An exception to support multiple inheritance allowed for re-execution of initializer functions if an untrusted non-view external call was made during initialization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reentrancy vulnerability in initializer functions.",
      "Lack of proper protection against nested calls to initializer functions during the initialization phase."
    ],
    "impact": "Double initialization of contracts leading to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. An attacker can potentially reinitialize a contract with attacker-controlled parameters if the initialization process makes external calls to an untrusted address.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can trigger reentrancy by making a call to a contract during its initialization phase, specifically if the contract's initialization function makes an external call to an untrusted contract.",
         "Subcalls to `initializer()`-protected functions within the same transaction, or multiple calls where one is a subcall of the other."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to deploy or control an external contract that the vulnerable contract interacts with during its initialization.",
      "Ability to trigger the initialization function of a contract via a proxy.",
      "An attacker needs the contract to make an external call to an untrusted address during initialization"
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when the initialization is not part of the proxy construction and reentrancy is possible by executing an external call to an untrusted address. The fix involves forbidding nested calls to `initializer()`-protected functions when the contract is already constructed and re-entrance is possible. A new `onlyInitializing()` modifier was introduced for internal functions during the transpilation process to prevent nested calls."
