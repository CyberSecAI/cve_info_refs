Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-39362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the automatic execution of unsaved SQL queries in Metabase. Specifically, ad-hoc native queries were being run automatically when a user accessed a question, without explicit user initiation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Auto-execution of SQL queries:** The primary weakness is the automatic execution of unsaved native SQL queries. This bypasses the need for user confirmation and opens up possibilities for malicious SQL injection.
-   **Lack of user control:** The system did not require explicit user action to run these native queries, reducing user awareness and the ability to avoid potential harm.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker could potentially craft a malicious SQL query and embed it in a question URL or through another vector that would cause the query to be executed automatically when viewed, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
-   **Data breaches and manipulation:** By executing arbitrary SQL, an attacker could gain access to sensitive data or modify existing data in the database connected to the Metabase instance.
-   **Denial of service:** Malicious queries could consume system resources, leading to denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Crafted URL:** An attacker could construct a specially crafted URL that includes a malicious SQL query. This URL could then be shared with a target user through phishing or other social engineering tactics.
-   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** If there were an XSS vulnerability within Metabase, an attacker could potentially embed such a malicious link or trigger the auto-execution via JavaScript.
-   **Other vectors** where an attacker can cause a user to load the crafted query through the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to craft SQL queries:** Attackers need to have an understanding of SQL to create malicious queries.
-   **Ability to get a user to load a crafted query:** Attackers would need to trick a victim into accessing a crafted URL. This may be done by social engineering or leveraging another vulnerability.
-   **Access to a Metabase Instance:** Attackers need to target a Metabase instance to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix is to require explicit action from the user to run the query. Metabase now shows the query in the native editor and gives the user the choice to run it manually.
- The vulnerability is classified as High severity.
