The provided content is related to CVE-2022-39383.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The VelaUX APIServer, when using Helm Chart as the component delivery method, does not restrict the request address of the Helm chart repository, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The vulnerability exists because the application was following HTTP 302 redirects, potentially allowing an attacker to redirect requests to internal resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Lack of restriction on request addresses for Helm chart repositories
- Unrestricted following of HTTP 302 redirects

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this SSRF vulnerability to access internal resources or perform other malicious activities that are accessible from the server hosting VelaUX APIServer.

**Attack vectors:**
- By specifying a malicious Helm chart repository address, an attacker can cause the server to make requests to arbitrary internal/external resources, due to the server following redirects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control the Helm chart repository address used by the VelaUX APIServer.
