Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `XSSRequestWrapper::stripXSS` method of the Knowage-Server application. This method attempts to sanitize user-provided input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. However, it uses a flawed approach of trying to filter out known XSS patterns, which is inherently prone to bypasses. The method is located in the file `knowageutils/src/main/java/it/eng/spagobi/utilities/filters/XSSRequestWrapper.java`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax:** The `stripXSS` method uses regular expressions to remove or modify potentially malicious code. However, it fails to account for various alternate XSS syntax and encoding techniques, allowing attackers to bypass the filters. For instance, the filtering logic does not consider the case where `vbscript:` is placed between `<scrivbscript:pt>` and `</scrivbscript:pt>` to inject `<script>alert(1)</script>`.
*   **Flawed Filtering Strategy:**  The core issue is the method's approach to XSS prevention by attempting to remove XSS syntax. Instead, a more context-aware approach is needed. The method also has various commented-out filtering logic, indicating an incomplete and potentially buggy implementation.
*   **Incomplete Handling of HTML Elements and Attributes**: The method attempts to filter script, object, form, a, and button tags, but fails to account for all possible attributes and variations.
*   **Reliance on Blacklisting:** The method is essentially using a blacklist approach, which is not robust. Attackers can easily find ways to craft XSS payloads that don't match the predefined patterns.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
*   **Account Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially take over user accounts by exploiting XSS.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance or behavior of the affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-provided Input:** The primary attack vector is through user-provided data, which can be in HTTP parameters, headers, or other input fields.
*   **Bypassing the Sanitization Filter:** Attackers can craft malicious payloads that bypass the flawed `stripXSS` method. The provided examples demonstrate how specific payloads that mix tags like `<scrivbscript:pt>` can achieve XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject input:** An attacker must be able to provide input to the Knowage-Server application. This typically requires access to a form or API that allows the submission of parameters that are then processed by the vulnerable code.
*   **No special privileges:** Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special privileges within the application itself; any user who can provide input may be able to exploit this.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub content contains the vulnerable code and also identifies the vulnerable versions (6.x.x, <7.4.22, <8.0.9, <8.1.0) and the patched versions.
*   The report correctly points out that the method's approach to sanitization is flawed and that the issue should be fixed closer to the rendering stage, instead of this sanitization filter.
*   The report mentions specific examples of payloads that can bypass the filter.

In summary, this content provides a detailed analysis of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Knowage-Server due to a flawed input sanitization function. It includes the root cause, impact, attack vectors, and specific bypass examples.
