- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application crashes when it receives a specific malformed WebSocket packet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a crash due to malformed packets, likely stemming from insufficient input validation or error handling in the WebSocket implementation. The associated CWE is CWE-248: Uncaught Exception.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted malformed packet. This will crash the application using the vulnerable `@fastify/websocket` module.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send malformed packets to the server over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the server running the vulnerable application. No user interaction or special privileges are needed.
