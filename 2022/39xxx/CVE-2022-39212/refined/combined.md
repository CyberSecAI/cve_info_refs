### @danxuliu **[danxuliu](/danxuliu)** commented [Aug 4, 2022](#issue-1328062167)

The stream sent to other peers is now separate from the one locally shown. This makes possible to adjust them independently to work around specific browser behaviours, for example, to ensure that zero-information-content video tracks will be always received by other participants when needed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[Split local streams and sent streams](/nextcloud/spreed/pull/7673/commits/23825308e2c667085b2fc0cf723c9481102dbe83 "Split local streams and sent streams

Until now the stream locally shown was the stream sent to the other
peers. Now there are separate streams for each case to be able to adjust
them independently to work around specific browser behaviours.

Nevertheless, the sent stream is a single stream shared by all sender
peers, not a stream specific for each peer, so it is still generated in
the local media class, just like the local stream.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
