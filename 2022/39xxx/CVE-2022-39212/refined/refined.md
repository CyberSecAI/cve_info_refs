Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39212:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the way Nextcloud Talk handles video streams when a user disables their video during a call. Instead of completely stopping the video stream, the application continued to send the last captured video frame.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the unintended transmission of the last video frame even when the video is disabled. This leads to a potential information leak.
*   **Improper Handling of Disabled Video:** The application doesn't properly stop or clear the video stream when a user disables their camera, leading to the persistence of the last frame.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker (another participant in the call) could potentially see the last video frame of a user who has disabled their video but still has a camera selected. This could expose sensitive information captured by the user's camera.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker exploits the vulnerability through the network connection during a Nextcloud Talk call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Call Participant:** The attacker must be a participant in the Nextcloud Talk call.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges as a regular call participant.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker does not need any interaction from the victim to view the last frame.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix was implemented by separating the local streams and sent streams, and by ensuring that a black video track is sent when no visible video is intended to be sent.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 4.3.
*   The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne.
*   Patched versions are 13.0.8 and 14.0.4.
*   The provided content contains links to the related pull request and the commit that fixed the vulnerability.
