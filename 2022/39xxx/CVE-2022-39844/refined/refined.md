Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39844:

**CVE-2022-39844: Possible to delete arbitrary directory vulnerability in Smart Switch PC**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of integrity check within the Smart Switch PC application. Specifically, the application doesn't properly prevent the use of directory junctions during the installation process.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Improper validation of integrity check:** The application fails to properly validate the integrity of paths used during the installation process, allowing for manipulation through directory junctions.
    *   **Directory junction vulnerability:** The software is vulnerable to attacks that utilize directory junctions to redirect file operations to arbitrary locations on the file system.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary directories on the system. This could lead to data loss, denial of service, or potentially further system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with the ability to manipulate files and directories on the system can exploit this vulnerability by creating a directory junction pointing to a directory they wish to delete.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where Smart Switch PC is installed. They also need the ability to create directory junctions, which typically requires administrative or elevated privileges.
