Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ParseVector` function in the `github.com/pandatix/go-cvss/20` package is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to missing checks when parsing a complete CVSS v2.0 vector string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125) within the `ParseVector` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The application using the vulnerable library will panic (crash) due to the out-of-bounds read.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a complete CVSS v2.0 vector string to the `ParseVector` function.
- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`) because the crafted input vector string could come from a remote source that is being processed by the vulnerable code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CVSS v2.0 vector string as input to the `ParseVector` function.
- No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, and there is no user interaction required.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same system as the vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**

- The issue was fixed in version `v0.4.0` of the `go-cvss` library, with commit `d9d478ff0c13b8b09ace030db9262f3c2fe031f4`.
- A workaround exists by avoiding parsing CVSS v2.0 vector strings that have all attributes defined.
- The provided exploit example code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability, causing the application to panic.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 with vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
