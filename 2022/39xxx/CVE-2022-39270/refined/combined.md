Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published

Oct 3, 2022

## Package

## Affected versions

< 2.1.0

## Description

### Impact

Users that can create topics in TOC-enabled categories (and have sufficient trust level - configured in component's settings) are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that topic's page.

### Workarounds

Alternatively, admins can temporarily disable the DiscoTOC theme component.

### Severity
