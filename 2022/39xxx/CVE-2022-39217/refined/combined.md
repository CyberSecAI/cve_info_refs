# Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File in ghas-to-csv

Moderate

[some-natalie](/some-natalie)
published
GHSA-634p-93h9-92vh
Sep 16, 2022

## Package

actions

ghas-to-csv
([GitHub Actions](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aactions))

## Affected versions

<v1

## Patched versions

v1

## Description

### Impact

This GitHub Action creates a CSV file without sanitizing the output of the APIs. If an alert is dismissed or any other custom field contains executable code / formulas, it might be run when an endpoint opens that CSV file in a spreadsheet program. The data flow looks like this 👇🏻

```
graph TD
    A(Repository) -->|developer dismissal, other data input| B(GitHub Advanced Security data)
    B -->|ghas-to-csv| C(CSV file)
    C -->|spreadsheet program| D(endpoint executes potentially malicious code)

```

 Loading

### Patches

Please use version `v1` or later. That tag moves from using `csv` to `defusedcsv` to mitigate this problem.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround. Please upgrade to using the latest tag, `v1` (or later).

### References

* CWE-1236 information from [MITRE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1236.html)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
