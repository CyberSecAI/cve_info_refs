Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-39326

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `run-terraform` reusable workflow in the `kartverket/github-workflows` repository was vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE). This was due to the insecure handling of `terraform plan` output. Specifically, the workflow was using the output of `terraform plan` without proper sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue was the lack of sanitization of the `terraform plan` output before it was used in a context where it could lead to code execution.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting malicious code into the `terraform plan` output, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the GitHub Actions workflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to execute arbitrary code within the GitHub Actions environment. This could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Modification of the repository or its artifacts
    - Compromise of secrets and credentials used within the workflow
    - Further attacks on other systems or infrastructure accessible from the GitHub Actions environment
- **High Severity:** Due to the potential for arbitrary code execution, the vulnerability is classified as high severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Pull Request Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the submission of a malicious pull request (PR).
- **Malicious Payload in `terraform plan` Output:** A malicious actor could craft a `terraform` configuration that, when executed, produces a `terraform plan` output containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create a PR:** An attacker must be able to submit a PR to the `kartverket/github-workflows` repository or any repository using the vulnerable workflow.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable workflow:** The attacker needs to be aware that the target repository is using the vulnerable `run-terraform` workflow.
- **Craft malicious payload:** The attacker must be capable of crafting a malicious `terraform` configuration that outputs a malicious payload.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

-   **Affected versions:**  Versions prior to `v2.7.5` of the `kartverket/github-workflows` repository are affected.
-   **Patched versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version `v2.7.5`.
-   **Workaround:** Before upgrading, users are advised to review any PRs from external users for malicious payloads before allowing them to trigger a build.
-   **Fix:** The fix involved sanitizing the `terraform plan` output by removing JavaScript template string symbols.
