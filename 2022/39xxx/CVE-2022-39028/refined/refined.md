Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `telrcv` function of multiple `telnetd` implementations (FreeBSD, NetBSD, inetutils, netkit, and Kerberos versions). This occurs because the code attempts to access `slctab[SLC_EC].sptr` or `slctab[SLC_EL].sptr` without verifying if these pointers have been initialized. These pointers are part of a global array `slctab` responsible for handling special character functions which are initialized later during the execution. If specific byte sequences are sent to the server before the table is initialized, the program will try to dereference a null pointer, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is the dereferencing of a NULL pointer. The `sptr` members of the `slctab` array are not initialized at the point in code they are accessed.
*   **Use of Uninitialized Data:** The telnetd code accesses the `slctab` array before the `get_slc_defaults()` function is called to properly initialize it. This results in the program using uninitialized values, specifically NULL pointers.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate or handle specific input sequences (IAC followed by EC or EL). The code path is taken before the server fully initializes itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can remotely crash the telnet server by sending specific byte sequences (`\xff\xf7` or `\xff\xf8`). The server process will terminate due to a segmentation fault.
*   **Permanent DoS (in some configurations):** In configurations using `inetd` or similar service managers, repeated crashes of the telnet server within a short period will lead to the service manager refusing to respawn the service, causing a permanent denial of service until the service is manually restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network via the telnet protocol. The attacker needs to establish a TCP connection to the telnet server and send the malicious byte sequence over the connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the vulnerable telnet server. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Basic knowledge of Telnet protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to send byte sequences that are interpreted as telnet commands.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in very old code (at least 30 years old), and was copied over into multiple forks of the original code.
*   The vulnerability affects several widely used telnet server implementations across different operating systems and devices.
*   The fix involves adding a null check before dereferencing the `sptr` pointers and initializing the variable used to store the pointer value with a default value.
