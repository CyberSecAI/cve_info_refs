{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `bucket_empty?` method within the `Task` model. The method lacked a check to ensure the provided 'bucket' was a valid task bucket before attempting to use it in a database query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unvalidated input leading to potential database query errors and denial of service."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can trigger a remote Denial of Service (DoS) by crafting requests with invalid 'bucket' parameters. The vulnerability can lead to high availability impact by causing the server to become unresponsive, due to heavy processing or database errors.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network attacks via the tasks endpoint with crafted requests containing an invalid task bucket."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a low privilege level, and must be authenticated to the application.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability is fixed by adding a check to validate the 'bucket' parameter using `Setting.task_bucket` which stores valid buckets, preventing the application from processing requests with invalid buckets. This prevents the application from executing potentially costly database queries with invalid data and causing a denial of service."
