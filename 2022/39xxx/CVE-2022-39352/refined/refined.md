- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises when the `user` field in a tuple is set to a `userset` (e.g., `folder:test#owner`) and that tuple's relation is then used on the right-hand side of a `from` statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authorization bypass. Specifically, the system incorrectly handles authorization checks when a userset is used as a user in a tuple and then used in a `from` statement.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass authorization checks, gaining unauthorized access or permissions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific tuple configurations where a `userset` is used as a user within a tuple and that relation is used in a `from` statement.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be in a position to manipulate or create tuples with the specific `userset` configuration described, and be able to leverage the `from` statement in authorization checks.
