After analyzing the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerability information:

**CVE-2022-39813 - Italtel NetMatch-S CI Multiple Cross Site Scripting Reflected/Stored- CWE-79**

*   **Root Cause:** The Italtel NetMatch-S CI web application does not properly sanitize parameters sent as input before including them in HTTP pages, leading to both stored and reflected XSS.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Improper Input Handling**: Lack of validation and sanitization of user-supplied data within the application.
    *   **Stored XSS**: Malicious scripts can be saved and executed by other users.
    *   **Reflected XSS**: User input is directly reflected in the response, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code.
    *   The malicious code is executed when a user browses the affected page.
    *   This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, account takeover, and other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Reflected XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript code in the `actLine` or `name` parameters for the `/NMSCI-WebGui/actloglineview.jsp` endpoint.
    *   **Stored XSS:** By injecting a malicious script into the `j_username` parameter of the `/NMSCI-WebGui/j_security_check` endpoint.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   For Reflected XSS: No authentication is needed.
    *  For Stored XSS: No authentication needed as the log is displayed to other users.
