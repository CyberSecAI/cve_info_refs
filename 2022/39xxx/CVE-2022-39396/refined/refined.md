- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Prototype pollution in the MongoDB database adapter allows an attacker to trigger remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Prototype pollution vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks exploiting the MongoDB BSON parser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction required. Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted BSON payload to the vulnerable parse-server instance.
