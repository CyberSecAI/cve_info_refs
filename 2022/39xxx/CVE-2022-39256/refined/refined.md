Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Deserialization of untrusted data. This vulnerability arises from the application's unsafe handling of deserialization, where it processes data from an untrusted source without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502):** The primary weakness is the insecure deserialization process, which allows an attacker to manipulate serialized data to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Orckestra C1 CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through the deserialization process. The content suggests the attack could be initiated by a user with any access level visiting a specially crafted site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of C1 CMS to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Crafted Site:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious site or have the user visit a malicious site that sends the crafted serialized data to the vulnerable application.
- **Unknowing User:**  The user could be tricked into performing actions that trigger the vulnerability unknowingly by visiting the specially crafted site.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is addressed in C1 CMS version 6.13. Upgrading is the recommended fix.
- A pull request ([#814](https://github.com/Orckestra/C1-CMS-Foundation/pull/814)) is associated with the fix, mentioning changes to `CompositeSerializationBinder` and limiting `MaxDepth` for JSON deserialization settings.
- The issue was discovered and reported by Markus Wulftange / Code White GmbH.
