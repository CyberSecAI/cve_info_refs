# What’s new in C1 CMS 6.13?

This release includes a critical security fix.

## Critical security fix

We have performed a critical security fix for a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, where a C1 Console user (with any access level) can complete a remote code execution attack on the website. See the [security advisory](https://github.com/Orckestra/C1-CMS-Foundation/security/advisories/GHSA-gfhp-jgp6-838j) for details.

## Free automated upgrade

To best protect you, Orckestra is providing free, immediate, and direct access to our automated upgrade feature – any C1 installation from C1 version 5.0 and later can now be upgraded to this release, free of charge.
