# Signature checks not applied to some retrieved missing events

High

[neilalexander](/neilalexander)
published
GHSA-pfw4-xjgm-267c
Sep 12, 2022

## Package

gomod

dendrite
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 0.9.7

## Patched versions

0.9.8

## Description

### Impact

Events retrieved from a remote homeserver using `/get_missing_events` did not have their signatures verified correctly. This could potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified events to Dendrite via this endpoint.

Note that this does not apply to events retrieved through other endpoints (e.g. `/event`, `/state`) as they have been correctly verified.

Homeservers that have federation disabled are not vulnerable.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in Dendrite 0.9.8.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds.

### Special thanks

Tulir Asokan, who spotted the issue originally.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-39200

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
