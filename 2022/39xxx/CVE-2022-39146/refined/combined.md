SSA-518824 Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Simcenter Femap
and Parasolid

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2022-09-13

V1.0

SUMMARY

Simcenter Femap and Parasolid are affected by multiple ﬁle parsing vulnerabilities that could be triggered
when the application reads ﬁles in X_T ﬁle formats. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the
affected applications, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the
context of the current process.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted X_T ﬁles in Simcenter Femap or Parasolid

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Parasolid is a 3D geometric modeling tool that supports various techniques, including solid modeling,
direct editing, and free-form surface/sheet modeling.

Simcenter Femap is an advanced simulation application for creating, editing, and inspecting ﬁnite element
models of complex products or systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
