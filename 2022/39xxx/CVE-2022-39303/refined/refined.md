Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the application directly incorporates user-provided values into SQL statements without using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability is present due to insecure handling of user input in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code, potentially leading to:
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data (Confidentiality: High)
*   Modification of data (Integrity: High)
*   Denial of service through database manipulation (Availability: High)

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can remotely send crafted input to the application that will be used in the vulnerable SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who can interact with the vulnerable application.
