- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability stems from improper validation of the `appIds` parameter in the Parse Server authentication adapter for Facebook and Spotify. The code accepts a string where it should only accept an array of strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation on the `appIds` parameter when configuring the Facebook or Spotify authentication adapter. Specifically, the code doesn't enforce the `appIds` parameter to be an array, and if set as string, it could lead to bypass the app ID validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially authenticate with a Facebook or Spotify app ID that differs from the server's configured app ID, provided that the attacker's app ID is a sub-string of the configured app ID. This would allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application and its data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through network requests when authenticating with the Parse Server using the affected Facebook or Spotify adapters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a valid access token from Facebook or Spotify. The attacker's app ID must be a subset of the server-side configured app ID when the server-side `appIds` is configured as a string. They would also need to be able to send a crafted authentication request with the forged app ID.
