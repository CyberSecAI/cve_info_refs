# Auth adapter app ID validation may be circumvented

GHSA-r657-33vp-gp22

## Package

npm

parse-server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

(<4.10.16) || (>=5.0.0 <5.2.7)

## Patched versions

(>=4.10.16 <5.0.0) || (>=5.2.7)

## Description

### Impact

Validation of the authentication adapter app ID for *Facebook* and *Spotify* may be circumvented.

This fixes a vulnerability that affects configurations which allow users to authenticate using the Parse Server authentication adapter for *Facebook* or *Spotify* and where the server-side authentication adapter configuration `appIds` is set as a string (e.g. `abc`) instead of an array of strings (e.g. `["abc"]`). The vulnerability makes it possible to authenticate requests which are coming from a *Facebook* or *Spotify* app with a different app ID than the one specified in the `appIds` configuration.

Both adapters still validate the access token with the respective authentication provider. An app ID is automatically assigned by the authentication provider. For this vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker would have to be assigned an app ID by the authentication provider which is a sub-set of the server-side configured app ID.

The documentation did not explicitly specify that the parameter `appIds` must be set as an array of strings and setting a string also worked. Therefore, there is a possibility that there are deployments where `appIds` is set as a string, making them vulnerable.

### Patches

The fix makes Parse Server check the type of the value set for `appIds` and throws an error if the value is not an array.

### Workarounds

No known workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
