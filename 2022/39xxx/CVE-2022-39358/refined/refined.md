- **Root cause of vulnerability:** It was possible to bypass locked parameters when requesting data for a question embedded in a dashboard by crafting a malicious backend request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Circumvention of parameter locking mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially access data they should not have access to by bypassing parameter restrictions.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted requests to the backend.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft requests to the backend.
