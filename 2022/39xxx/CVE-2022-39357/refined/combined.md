## UX/UI Improvements

* Added support for streaming file uploads directly to S3 storage disks via the `stream_uploads` option on the disk configuration. Requires the [Winter.DriverAWS](https://github.com/wintercms/wn-driveraws-plugin) plugin.
* Added support for the `data-request-parent` attribute to the AJAX framework, allowing AJAX requests to include the data from the elements that spawned them which allows for highly complex workflows where popups spawn popups and then those popups need to call their own AJAX handlers but the page previously didn't know to initialize them without their parent data being present. This fixes support of the RecordFinder inside of popups like the RelationController's update & pivot forms as well as the FileUpload's description form popup inside of other popups.
* Switched the `winter:up` / `migrate` commands to use the new Laravel CLI components for improved output formatting.
* Added support for `type: range` Form fields.
* Added support for the `conditions` property on List Columns with a relationship defined via the `relation` property.
* Added support for changing an image's extension / file type when using the ImageResizer to resize the image.
* Added support for ignoring specific Mix packages to avoid including third-party Mix packages in your application's `package.json` unnecessarily.
* Clicking the label of a `switch` field will now toggle the switch.
* Increased the width of the crop dimension inputs when cropping or resizing an image in the Media widget.
* Standard HTML flash messages that are converted to JavaScript flash messages through Snowboard are now removed once converted, to prevent the original message from remaining even after the flash message is dismissed.
* The autogenerated password for the default administrator account is now displayed in the `winter:install` command output and can be changed through the wizard.
* Documented `app.tempPath` configuration option.
* Added `winter:password` as an alias for `winter:passwd`.
* Minor CSS improvements.

## API Changes

* Removed the default `maxlength` of 255 from `type: text` Form fields.
* The `twig.environment.cms` Twig environment is no longer provided as a singleton, instead being generated on each request to `App::make()`. This helps to avoid conflicts when calling the CMS controller multiple times in the same request.
* Deprecated the `Winter\Storm\Database\Behaviors\Purgeable` behavior as the `Purgeable` trait is now included by default on all Winter models.
* Added the `backend.formwidgets.fileupload.onUpload` event to allow for custom handling of file uploads in the FileUpload FormWidget.
* Added the `backend.widgets.uploadable.onUpload` event to allow for custom handling of file uploads in the widgets that implement the `Backend\Traits\UploadableWidget` trait.
* Added the `formwidgets.fileupload.initUploader` Snowboard global JS event to allow for interacting with the FileUpload's JS uploader instance.
* Added the `formwidgets.richeditor.init` Snowboard global JS event to allow for interacting with the RichEditor's JS editor instance.
* Added the `widgets.mediamanager.initUploader` Snowboard global JS event to allow for interacting with the MediaManager's JS uploader instance.
* Switched visibility of `getRelationModel()` from protected to public on the `Backend\Traits\FormModelWidget` trait.
* Switched visibility of `getOptionsFromModel()` from protected to public on the `Backend\Widgets\Form` widget.
* Added the following methods to the `Backend\Traits\UploadableWidget` trait to make it easier to customize upload behaviour:
  + `uploadableGetDisk()`
  + `uploadableGetUploadPath()`
  + `uploadableGetUploadUrl()`
* Added the following model relation events:
  + `model.relation.beforeAdd($relationName, $relatedModel)`
  + `model.relation.afterAdd($relationName, $relatedModel)`
  + `model.relation.beforeRemove($relationName, $relatedModel)`
  + `model.relation.afterRemove($relationName, $relatedModel)`
  + `model.relation.beforeAssociate($relationName, $relatedModel)`
  + `model.relation.afterAssociate($relationName, $relatedModel)`
  + `model.relation.beforeDisassociate($relationName)`
  + `model.relation.afterDisassociate($relationName)`
* A new `mix:run` Artisan command has been added to allow scripts defined in the `package.json` file of a Mix package to be run easily through the CLI. You can find the [documentation here](https://wintercms.com/docs/console/asset-compilation#mix-run).
* The AJAX framework and Snowboard framework now both enforce either a class name dot (`.`) or an ID hash (`#`) to be prefixed to any partials that are to be updated in an AJAX response. This includes any mapped selectors.
* Snowboard JavaScript AJAX requests now accept two or three parameters, similar to the old framework. When using two parameters, the user only needs to specify the handler and options - it is assumed in this case that the AJAX requests is detached and not tied to an element.
* Added `Winter\Storm\Database\Traits\HasSortableRelations` trait to make it easier to sort related records on a model.
* Added support for `**` as a wildcard when setting the application's trusted proxies. This was originally supported in `fideloper/trustedProxy` but was removed without explanation in Laravel 5.6. `*` will trust the currently requesting IP address, `**` will trust all proxies in a chain of proxies (often required if you are behind something like CloudFront and another proxy). This was required for retrieving the correct Client IP address when using Laravel Vapor.
* Properties added to Model instances via `addDynamicProperty()` are now automatically added as purgeable attributes to prevent them from being saved to the database.
* Added the `Arr::moveKeyToIndex($array, $targetKey, $index)` helper method to make it easier to move a specific array element to the specified index.
* Added the `Str::unique($str, $items, $separator, $step)` helper method that ensures the provided string will be unique when compared to the provided array by adjusting the string with the separator & step as necessary. Useful for filename deplication or other deduplication of unique references.
* Added the `Str::join($items, $glue, $lastGlue, $dyadicGlue)` helper method to join an array of items with a glue string, optionally using a different glue string for the last item and for the dyadic item case (only two items). By default this applies the "Oxford / Serial Comma" gramatical construct when listing items.
* Added the `fromStorage()` helper method to the `Winter\Storm\Database\Attach\File` model class in order to create a new file record from a file path that already exists on the file model's storage disk.
* Added new `Winter\Storm\Console\Traits\HandlesCleanup` trait to the base Winter `Command` class that makes it easier to implement cross-platform cleanup logic on your CLI commands when process termination signals are received.
* Added support for root level paths in the Halcyon DbDatasource, required for Child Theme support.
* Added support for exit codes in `mix:compile`. Also added support for the `--silent`, `--stop-on-error`, and `--manifest` flags.

## Bug Fixes

* The `winter:test` command now automatically uses the correct bootstrap file for unit testing, irrespective of the `bootstrap` configuration in any plugin or module's `phpunit.xml` file, to assist users migrating their unit tests to Winter 1.2.
* Fixed issue where plugins weren't being correctly sorted by their dependencies when depending on a plugin that registers itself as a replacement which could cause migrations to run in the incorrect order.
* Fixed typo in the MediaManager widget that was preventing SVGs from displaying their previews in the sidebar.
* Fixed issue when attempting to generate a TailwindCSS theme scaffold on a case sensitive file system.
* Fixed mismatching method signature on AutoDatasource->lastModified() that could cause issues when using DatabaseTemplates in v1.2.
* Fixed issue where MorphedByMany relationships would use the wrong class name when building queries.
* Removed an override to the `Input::all()` facade method, which prevented files from being included in the result, breaking previous behaviour.
* Removed an extra `0` that was left over in `numberrange` filter partials.
* Fixed an issue where only the last component would be saved in a CMS template due to the framework not correctly processing arrayed POST data.
* Fixed an issue with the `winter:fresh` command where the demo plugin was not removed and an error message was shown.
* The Array Source trait will no longer attempt to save a temporary SQLite DB if storage is disabled via setting `$cacheArray` to `false`.
* Fixed an issue where custom AJAX error responses were being mangled by the Snowboard Request class, before sending off to the error handlers. If an error does not appear to be a PHP exception with an exception class and message, it will now pass through the response untouched (but still be considered an error response).
* Fixed an issue where the File model's `fromUrl()` method would not correctly determine the file's mimeType if the file was delivered with a `Content-Type` header that was incorrectly capitalized.
* Fixed an issue where migrations using anonymous classes could not be run more than once in a single process.
* Fixed support for the Laravel `ClassName@method` syntax for event listeners.
* Fixed issue where custom pivot models were not being used when using the `attach` method on a BelongsToMany relationship.
* Fixed support for queueing emails (was broken by a change in Laravel 7 that was missed in the Winter v1.2 upgrade).
* Fixed support for hidden files in Zip folders on systems without support for GLOB\_BRACE (Solaris, Alpine Linux, etc).
* Fixed issue that occurred when attempting to dynamically add HasOneThrough|HasManyThrough relations to models.
* Improved support for Winter < v1.2 mail configurations.
* Fixed breaking change in Laravel 9.36 with the `Winter\Storm\Console\Command`'s `alert()` method.
* Fixed issue with identifying currently installed versions of plugins when the versions reported by the filesystem do not match exactly (i.e. with or without the "v" prefix) the versions reported by the database.
* Fixed issue where Snowboard assets loaded via the `{% snowboard %}` Twig tag were not taking into account the configured `app.asset_url` of the application.
* Fixed issue where the Status backend Dashboard Widget would break on clean installs.
* Improved the reliability of the System's first boot date by storing it as a system parameter instead of relying on the oldest present plugin.
* Fixed an issue where migrations were not ran if a notes output instance is not available to the migrator.
* Fixed an issue where attempting to crop images with unsafe characters in their path would fail.
* Fixed support for Winter Mix commands on Windows.
* Fixed an issue where attempting to crop / resize images that were bigger than the viewport window would fail when using the TailwindUI backend skin.
* Fixed issue when attempting to preview a CSV column with the ImportExportController behavior.
* Fixed issue where the `codeeditor` and `richeditor` fields were not properly triggering change events when their contents were changed.
* Fixed issue where custom error messages sent via AJAX and processed by Snowboard would not be properly handled.
* Fixed issue where the `jobs` / `failed_jobs` table structure did not match that of Laravel 9.

## Security Improvements

* Prototype hardening has been implemented on the Snowboard framework to prevent prototype pollution. You may [read the security advisory for more information](https://github.com/wintercms/winter/security/advisories/GHSA-3fh5-q6fg-w28q).
* Fixed issue where the AuthManager's persistence cookie was not respecting the configuration values set in `config/session.php`.
* Added a new `Svg` helper class to make it easier to work with SVG files. Currently one method (`extract()`) is availabel which sanitizes and optionally minifies the provided SVG file making it safer to deal with.
* Added `migrate` to the list of commands that require plugins to have the `$elevated` property set in order to run when the command is being run.

## Translation Improvements

* Fixed a misnamed language string for the custom editor HTML styles input.
* Improved German translation.
* Improved Vietanamese translation.
* Improved Ukrainian translation.
* Improved Russian translation.

## Performance Improvements

* Slightly optimised searching for used slugs with models using the Sluggable trait by runnning an "exists" query as opposed to a "count" query.

## Community Improvements

* The Winter CMS module sub-split is now automated, ensuring that the module repositories are now automatically updated with the latest changes as soon as they are committed to the main repository.
* The base `System\Tests\Bootstrap\PluginTestCase` class has been signficantly refactored to improve testing in plugins. While it is mostly backwards-compatible, the method `runPluginRefreshCommand` is now deprecated and will be removed in the Winter CMS 1.3 branch. Please use the `instantiatePlugin` method instead if you have overridden the core plugin test case methods.

## Dependencies

* Moved the Laravel configuration file writing functionality out of the `Winter\Storm` library and into it's own standalone `Winter\LaravelConfigWriter` library. This was done in order to reuse it in the web installer, but also means that any Laravel application can take advantage of this package.
* Made the Composer merge plugin less greedy by default, previously it would merge in all plugin composer.json files that existed in your project, now it will only merge in specific plugin paths defined in your project's `composer.json`. Copy [the changes](https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/e05a20eddc28b0cb4eb6fa8b048fc319cca467ae) from GitHub in order to apply it to your projects.

# Prototype pollution in Snowboard framework

Low

[bennothommo](/bennothommo)
published
GHSA-3fh5-q6fg-w28q
Oct 26, 2022

## Package

composer

wintercms/winter
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

1.1.8, 1.1.9, 1.2.0

## Patched versions

1.1.10, 1.2.1

## Description

### Impact

The Snowboard framework in affected versions is vulnerable to prototype pollution in the main Snowboard class as well as its plugin loader. We have marked this as low severity as the Snowboard framework is not predominantly used yet and is not used in the administration panel, but it is important if you use Snowboard for your theme or plugin that you upgrade Winter as soon as possible.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in [2a13faf](https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/2a13faf99972e84c9661258f16c4750fa99d29a1) (for 1.2) and [bce4b59](https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/bce4b59584abf961e9400af3d7a4fd7638e26c7f) (for 1.1) and is available with Winter v1.1.10 and v1.2.1.

### Workarounds

If you have not yet upgraded, or are using the 1.1 branch of Winter (1.1.8 or above), you can avoid this issue by following some common security practices for JavaScript, including implementing a [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and auditing your scripts.

The 1.0 branch of Winter is not affected, as it does not contain the Snowboard framework.

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-39357

## Security Improvements

* Prototype hardening has been implemented on the Snowboard framework to prevent prototype pollution. You may [read the security advisory for more information](https://github.com/wintercms/winter/security/advisories/GHSA-3fh5-q6fg-w28q).

## Community Improvements

* The image resizer tests have been re-done in order to more accurately test image resizing in Winter. The tests themselves will generate artifacts that can be reviewed as a ZIP file if the tests fail.
