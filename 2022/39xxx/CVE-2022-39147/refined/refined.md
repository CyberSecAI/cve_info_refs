- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to uninitialized pointer access while parsing specially crafted X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Access of an uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads specially crafted X_T files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious X_T file with the affected application. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious X_T file.
