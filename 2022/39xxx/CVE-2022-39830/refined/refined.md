{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the absence of a check on the return value of the `EC_KEY_set_public_key_affine_coordinates()` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The code lacks a check on the return value of `EC_KEY_set_public_key_affine_coordinates()`. This function returns 1 on success or 0 on error. Ignoring this return value may lead to unexpected behavior if the function fails.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The missing return value check can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the `sign_pFwInfo()` function.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is related to the failure of `EC_KEY_set_public_key_affine_coordinates()`, which is not handled properly.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to trigger a scenario where the `EC_KEY_set_public_key_affine_coordinates()` function fails, which is not further detailed in the provided context."
