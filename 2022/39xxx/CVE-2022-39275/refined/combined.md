# Improper object type validation in mutations leading to unauthorized access

Moderate

[NyanKiyoshi](/NyanKiyoshi)
published
GHSA-xhq8-8c5v-w8ff
Oct 3, 2022

## Package

Saleor
(GHCR)

## Affected versions

>= 2.0.0

## Patched versions

3.7.17, 3.6.18, 3.5.23, 3.4.24, 3.3.26, 3.2.14, 3.1.24

## Description

### Impact

Some GraphQL mutations were not properly checking the ID type input which allowed to access database objects that the authenticated user may not be allowed to access.

Affects Saleor >= 2.0.0, breakdown:

* `accountSetDefaultAddress` >= 2.6.0 ([2b63e12](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/2b63e120a144dce609ecd333c94b10a53d9e932b))
* `accountAddressDelete` >= 2.9.0 ([ad1b899](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/ad1b8995dbc430859b07a8f2699c571553a7fd19))
* `addressDelete` >= 2.6.0 ([2b63e12](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/2b63e120a144dce609ecd333c94b10a53d9e932b))
* `productVariantBulkCreate` >= 2.9.0 ([d5fae21](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/d5fae21fb38d1e9bedffac79dcd08e2c1031ef3f))
* `assignNavigation` >= 2.0.0 ([273867b](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/273867bdede2246e4b42ee5cea041c529bc09a9e))

This vulnerability can be used to expose the following information:

* Estimating database row counts from tables with a sequential primary key
* Exposing staff user and customer email addresses and full name through the `assignNavigation()` mutation

| Mutation Name | Required Privileges | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accountSetDefaultAddress` | Authenticated User | Request is rejected with error message:`The address doesn't belong to that user` |
| `accountAddressDelete` | Authenticated User or `MANAGE_USERS` | * Crashes with error message for staff user with manage user permission:`'User' object has no attribute 'user_addresses'` * Authenticated User: request is rejected with message:`You need one of the following permissions: MANAGE_USERS, OWNER` |
| `addressDelete` | `MANAGE_USERS` | Crash with error message:`'User' object has no attribute 'user_addresses'` |
| `productVariantBulkCreate` | `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` | Crash with error message:`'User' object has no attribute 'variants'` |
| `assignNavigation` | `MANAGE_MENUS` or `MANAGE_SETTINGS` | Crash leaking object Python representation, address ID leak the user's full name. Error message:`Cannot assign \"<Address: John Doe>\": \"SiteSettings.top_menu\" must be a \"Menu\" instance.` |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
