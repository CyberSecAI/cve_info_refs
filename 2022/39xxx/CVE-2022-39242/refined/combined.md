### @notlesh **[notlesh](/notlesh)** commented [Sep 12, 2022](#issue-1369889937)

This fixes a bug where weight was not refunded after execution, which meant that the worst-case weight (based on `gas_limit`) was accounted for in all cases. This change calls `Extra::post_dispatch` which can invoke `CheckWeight::post_dispatch`, which will properly refund any extra weight.

Note that this only applies to `weight` accounting, the currency used for fees was already working as designed.

Thanks to [@nbaztec](https://github.com/nbaztec) for adding tests.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This implies that we are adding Substrate`s notion of base weight and Ethereum's. I don't believe these should be added in this way, as they both account for the same things (signature verification and basic accounting of fees).

It would be great if we could convince substrate not to include the `extrinsic_base_weight`...

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Weight not properly refunded after EVM execution

Low

published
GHSA-v57h-6hmh-g2p4
Sep 23, 2022

## Package

cargo

Frontier
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< commit d3beddc6911a559a3ecc9b3f08e153dbe37a8658

## Patched versions

>= commit d3beddc6911a559a3ecc9b3f08e153dbe37a8658

## Description

### Impact

Previously, the worst case weight was always accounted as the block weight for all cases. In case of large EVM gas refunds, this can lead to block spamming attacks -- the adversary can construct blocks with transactions that have large amount of refunds or unused gases with reverts, and as a result inflate up the chain gas prices. This issue is fixed by properly refund unused weights after each EVM execution.

The impact of this issue is limited in that the spamming attack would still be costly for any adversary, and it has no ability to alter any chain state.

### Patches

The issue is fixed in [#851](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/pull/851)

### Workarounds

None.
