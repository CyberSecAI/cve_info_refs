Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-39242:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is that the weight was not refunded after EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) execution. This means that the maximum possible weight based on `gas_limit` was always accounted for, even if the actual execution used less.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect Weight Calculation:** The system was not properly accounting for unused weight after EVM execution by not calling `Extra::post_dispatch` which invokes `CheckWeight::post_dispatch` and thus could not refund unused weight.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Block Spamming:** An attacker could create blocks with transactions that have large amounts of refunded gas. Because the worst case weight was used, this leads to inflating gas prices.
- **Costly Attacks:** Even though the attack is possible, it was costly for the adversary.
- **No State Change:** The vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to alter any chain state.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious Transactions:** An attacker would craft EVM transactions with high gas limits but designed to execute quickly and revert or not use all the allocated gas.
- **Block Construction:** The attacker would then assemble these transactions in a block.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to submit transactions to the network.
- No special privileges or insider access are required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in pull request #851
- The fix involves calling `Extra::post_dispatch` which will invoke `CheckWeight::post_dispatch` to correctly refund any extra weight.
- The issue was limited to weight accounting and not the currency used for fees.
- The severity is considered low.
