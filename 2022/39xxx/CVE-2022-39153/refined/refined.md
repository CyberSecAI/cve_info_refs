- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer when parsing X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads specially crafted X_T files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious X_T file.
