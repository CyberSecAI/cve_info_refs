Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-39334

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `nextcloudcmd` command-line client incorrectly trusts bad TLS certificates by default. It does not properly validate the server's TLS certificate, proceeding with the sync operation even if the certificate is untrusted or invalid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation in `nextcloudcmd`.
- Failure to reject untrusted server certificates by default.
- The client incorrectly interprets the certificate validation failure as "not an actual error".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is possible, allowing an attacker to intercept and potentially modify data transferred between the `nextcloudcmd` client and the Nextcloud server.
- This could lead to a compromise of data confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker who can execute the `nextcloudcmd` command on a user's machine.
- The attacker could set up a malicious server impersonating the legitimate Nextcloud server using a self-signed or invalid TLS certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the user's machine to execute the `nextcloudcmd` command.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the network and present a malicious server with an invalid TLS certificate.
- The user needs to run the `nextcloudcmd` command.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of the Nextcloud Desktop client prior to 3.6.1.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #5022, which changes the default behavior of `nextcloudcmd` to reject untrusted certificates unless the `--trust` option is explicitly specified.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity, primarily because it requires local user interaction and has limited impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, according to the provided CVSS score.
