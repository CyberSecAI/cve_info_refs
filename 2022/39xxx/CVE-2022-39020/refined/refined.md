- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple instances of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization or encoding in various features of the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Student assessment submissions
    - File uploads
    - News creation
    - ePortfolio creation
    - Calendar event creation
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable input fields or features. The user interaction required for the stored XSS would be to view the malicious content, whereas reflected XSS would require tricking a user into clicking a malicious link.
