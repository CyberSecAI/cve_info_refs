- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability while parsing specially crafted X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted X_T file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious X_T file using the affected application. The attacker needs local access and user interaction is required.
