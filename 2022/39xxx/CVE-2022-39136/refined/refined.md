- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A fixed-length heap-based buffer overflow occurs when parsing specially crafted TIF files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a malicious TIF file using the affected software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious TIF file. No special privileges are required.
