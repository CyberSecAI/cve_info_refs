Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-39260:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `git shell` command uses an `int` to represent the number of entries in the array when splitting the command line arguments with `split_cmdline()`. This can be overflowed by a malicious user, leading to arbitrary heap writes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The use of a signed `int` to store the number of arguments when splitting the command line allows for a controlled integer overflow.
*   **Heap Overflow:** The integer overflow in `split_cmdline()` leads to arbitrary heap writes due to the incorrect calculation of the size of the `argv` array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Because the overflowed array is passed to `execv()`, an attacker can leverage this to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Unexpected app termination**: Apple mentions an unexpected app termination if `git shell` is allowed as a login shell, which is caused by the heap overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`git shell` Interactive Mode:** The vulnerability is triggered when `git shell` is used as a login shell with the `$HOME/git-shell-commands` directory present, allowing execution of scripts in that directory with user provided arguments.
*   **Overly Long Command String:** An attacker needs to provide an overly long command string to `git shell` in order to overflow the integer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to `git shell`:** The attacker must have the ability to access `git shell` on the victim machine.
*   **Interactive mode enabled:** The directory `$HOME/git-shell-commands` must exist on the victim's machine, enabling interactive mode for `git shell`.
*   **Ability to supply long string**: The attacker needs to be able to pass a very long string to the `git shell` command.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found by Kevin Backhouse of GitHub Security Lab.
*   The fix involves making `git shell` reject interactive commands longer than 4MiB, and hardening `split_cmdline()` to reject inputs larger than 2GiB.
*   Patched versions include 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, 2.37.4, and 2.38.1.
*   Workarounds include disabling `git shell` access or removing the `$HOME/git-shell-commands` directory.
