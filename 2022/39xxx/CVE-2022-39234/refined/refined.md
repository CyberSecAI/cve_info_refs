{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The user's session persists even after their account is deleted or deactivated due to the continued validity of the user's cookie.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Session management vulnerability. Failure to invalidate existing user sessions upon account deletion/deactivation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A deleted or deactivated user can continue to use their account as long as their cookie remains valid. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources and data associated with the account.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability, presumably by someone who has previously logged in, and obtained valid cookies.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs a valid cookie belonging to a deleted/deactivated user. This means they would have needed to have logged in previously to obtain the cookie before their account was deleted."
