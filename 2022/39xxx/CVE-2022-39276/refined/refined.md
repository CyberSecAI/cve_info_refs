Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper URL validation when handling redirects in RSS feeds and external calendar integrations within the GLPI application. Specifically, when a remote script returns a redirect response, the target URL isn't checked against the administrator-defined allow list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core issue is the vulnerability to SSRF. The application makes requests to external URLs without sanitizing or validating the redirect target.
- **Lack of URL Allow List Enforcement:** The application fails to enforce the URL allow list configured by the administrator when processing redirects. This bypasses security controls intended to restrict external access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality (Low):** An attacker could potentially access internal resources or services not meant to be publicly accessible by manipulating the redirect target. The level of confidentiality impact is deemed low by the CVSS score
- **Integrity (None):**  The CVSS score indicates no direct impact on the integrity of the system.
- **Availability (None):** The CVSS score indicates no direct impact on the availability of the system
- By controlling the redirect URL, an attacker could potentially probe internal network resources or access sensitive data by forcing the server to make requests to attacker-controlled locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:**  The attacker needs to have low privileges to trigger the vulnerability by adding or modifying an RSS feed or calendar integration
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require user interaction beyond the initial setup of the RSS feed or calendar.
- **High Attack Complexity**: The attack has a high complexity.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of GLPI prior to 10.0.4 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.0.4 and later.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
