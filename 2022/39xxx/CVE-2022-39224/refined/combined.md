# Arbitrary shell execution when extracting or listing files contained in a malicious rpm.

High

[jordansissel](/jordansissel)
published
GHSA-88cv-mj24-8w3q
Sep 19, 2022

## Package

bundler

arr-pm
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<=0.0.11

## Patched versions

0.0.12

## Description

### Impact

Arbitrary shell execution is possible when using RPM::File#files and RPM::File#extract if the RPM contains a malicious "payload compressor" field.

This vulnerability impacts the `extract` and `files` methods of the `RPM::File` class in the affected versions of this library.

### Patches

Version 0.0.12 is available with a fix for these issues.

### Workarounds

When using an affected version of this library (arr-pm), ensure any RPMs being processed contain valid/known payload compressor values. Such values include: gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd, and lzma.

You can check the payload compressor field in an rpm by using the rpm command line tool. For example:

```
% rpm -qp example-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm --qf "%{PAYLOADCOMPRESSOR}\n"
gzip

```
### Impact on known dependent projects

This library is used by [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm). The vulnerability may impact fpm only when using the flag `-s rpm` or `--input-type rpm` to convert a malicious rpm to another format. It does not impact creating rpms.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @jordansissel **[jordansissel](/jordansissel)** commented [Sep 17, 2022](#issue-1376890180)

This change is to improve safety primarily to reject malicious rpms with a custom PAYLOADCOMPRESSOR tag causing arr-pm to execute arbitrary code.

The security issue was reported by Joern Schneeweisz.

An alternate implementation could be to do what rpm does in its rpmio library which is to use the C implementations of various compressor libraries. However, doing this in Ruby can cause problems because it's not always possible to compile C Ruby extensions or even install Ruby's FFI library.

Test coverage checks for accepting known payload compressors and also rejecting unknown compressor values.

Context: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/97602>

Sorry, something went wrong.
