Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39135:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within Apache Calcite, which is used by Apache Solr's SQL handler. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- XML External Entity (XXE) Injection: The SQL handler in Solr is vulnerable to XXE injection when processing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to manipulate XML parsing to perform malicious actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Disclosure of confidential data:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive files on the Solr server's filesystem.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could be exploited to cause a denial of service.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could use the Solr server to make requests to internal or external systems.
- **Port Scanning:** An attacker could use the Solr server to scan the network for open ports.
- **Other system impacts:** The vulnerability can potentially lead to other unspecified system impacts.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious SQL queries that are processed by the Solr's `/sql` handler.
- Attackers can supply the malicious SQL queries directly to the `/sql` handler or indirectly via proxies or other applications.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send SQL queries to Solrâ€™s `/sql` handler, either directly or indirectly.
- This typically means the attacker needs to have some level of access to the Solr instance. It's noted that this functionality may have been exposed to internal analysts for JDBC-based tooling and unlikely to be granted to wider audiences.
- The vulnerable component is only exploitable when the Solr instance is running in SolrCloud mode and when the SQL handler is enabled. Users not using SolrCloud are not affected as the SQL functionality is not available.

**Additional Notes:**

-  Solr 9 modularized the SQL functionality, making it opt-in. Therefore, Solr 9 users who don't use SQL functionality are not vulnerable.
-  The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the SQL handler using the provided configuration in solrconfig.xml
-  The vulnerability is fixed in Solr 9.1. It is recommended to upgrade to 9.1 if the SQL functionality is needed. A future version of 8.11.3 might also have the fix.
