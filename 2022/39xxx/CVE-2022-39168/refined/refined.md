- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Robotic Process Automation Client stores proxy credentials in upgrade logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (proxy credentials) in log files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to systems or networks accessible via the exposed proxy credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could gain access to the log file (`C:\ProgramData\IBM Robotic Process Automation\Setup\SetupServices.log`) on a system where the vulnerable software is installed, potentially gaining access to proxy credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the file system where the logs are stored. This could be a malicious insider or an attacker with compromised access.
