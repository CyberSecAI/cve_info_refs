  "CVE-2022-39251": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The matrix-js-sdk is vulnerable to user spoofing via Olm/Megolm protocol confusion. A malicious homeserver can construct messages that appear to have come from another person by using Megolm instead of Olm encryption for to-device messages. Additionally, this can be used to perform targeted attacks such as injecting a malicious key backup secret during self-verification. The vulnerability occurs because the SDK accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of the expected Olm.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The matrix-js-sdk incorrectly accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm, while only Olm encryption should be accepted. This protocol confusion allows a malicious server to spoof to-device messages.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Protocol confusion by accepting Megolm-encrypted to-device messages instead of Olm.",
        "Lack of proper validation of message origin, relying on fields controllable by the homeserver instead of the Olm session."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can send spoofed messages that appear to originate from another user without any indication like a grey shield, as well as send fake to-device messages to inject malicious key backup secrets, potentially leading to the targeted device using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious homeserver can send to-device messages encrypted using Megolm instead of Olm. This can be combined with other attacks such as spoofing key backups.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires a malicious homeserver to be able to construct and send the malformed messages to the client."

    "CVE-2022-39249": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The matrix-js-sdk is vulnerable to impersonated messages due to permissive key forwarding. A malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. This is due to the SDK's overly permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end, accepting forwarded keys not in response to previously issued requests or from unverified devices.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The matrix-js-sdk implements a too permissive key forwarding strategy, accepting forwarded keys from unverified sources without ensuring they match previous requests.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
       "Permissive key forwarding policy, accepting keys not in response to prior requests.",
        "Accepting key forwards from untrusted sources (not own or verified devices)."

      "impact": "An attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. These messages may be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others.",

    "CVE-2022-39250": {
    "related": true,
     "summary": "The matrix-js-sdk is vulnerable to user impersonation due to key/device identifier confusion in SAS verification. A malicious homeserver can interfere with the verification flow between users, injecting its own cross-signing identity to cause the device to trust/verify the attacker's user identity.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The matrix-js-sdk checks and signs user identities and devices in two separate steps, without adequately fixing the keys to be signed between those steps.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
         "Confusion between device IDs and cross-signing keys during SAS verification.",
         "Failure to ensure the key signed is the one that was verified during SAS."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject their cross-signing user identity in place of one of the user's, causing the other device to trust/verify the user identity under the control of the homeserver, instead of the intended one.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious homeserver can manipulate the verification process, substituting its own identity.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a malicious homeserver to interfere with the verification flow."
