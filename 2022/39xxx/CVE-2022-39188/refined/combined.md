Debian Bug     : 1018752

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-4159

    A flaw was found in the eBPF verifier which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read.  If unprivileged use of eBPF is enabled, this
    could leak sensitive information.  This was already disabled by
    default, which would fully mitigate the vulnerability.

CVE-2021-33655

    A user with access to a framebuffer console device could cause a
    memory out-of-bounds write via the FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO ioctl.

CVE-2021-33656

    A user with access to a framebuffer console device could cause a
    memory out-of-bounds write via some font setting ioctls.  These
    obsolete ioctls have been removed.

CVE-2022-1462

    ‰∏ÄÂè™Áãó reported a race condition in the pty (pseudo-terminal)
    subsystem that can lead to a slab out-of-bounds write.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1679

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the ath9k_htc driver
    which can lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to
    cause a denial service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2153

    "kangel" reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
    user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-2318

    A use-after-free in the Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose) support may
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-2586

    A use-after-free in the Netfilter subsystem may result in local
    privilege escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2588

    Zhenpeng Lin discovered a use-after-free flaw in the cls_route
    filter implementation which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2663

    David Leadbeater reported flaws in the nf_conntrack_irc
    connection-tracking protocol module.  When this module is enabled
    on a firewall, an external user on the same IRC network as an
    internal user could exploit its lax parsing to open arbitrary TCP
    ports in the firewall, to reveal their public IP address, or to
    block their IRC connection at the firewall.

CVE-2022-3028

    Abhishek Shah reported a race condition in the AF_KEY subsystem,
    which could lead to an out-of-bounds write or read.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption), to obtain sensitive information, or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740, CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742

    Roger Pau Monne discovered that Xen block and network PV device
    frontends don't zero out memory regions before sharing them with
    the backend, which may result in information disclosure.
    Additionally it was discovered that the granularity of the grant
    table doesn't permit sharing less than a 4k page, which may also
    result in information disclosure.

CVE-2022-26373

    It was discovered that on certain processors with Intel's Enhanced
    Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities there
    are exceptions to the documented properties in some situations,
    which may result in information disclosure.

    Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html>

CVE-2022-33744

    Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that ARM Xen guests can cause a
    denial of service to the Dom0 via paravirtual devices.

CVE-2022-36879

    A flaw was discovered in xfrm_expand_policies in the xfrm
    subsystem which can cause a reference count to be dropped twice.

CVE-2022-36946

    Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera reported a memory
    corruption flaw in the Netfilter subsystem which may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2022-39188

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the kernel's handling of
    unmapping of certain memory ranges.  When a driver created a
    memory mapping with the VM_PFNMAP flag, which many GPU drivers do,
    the memory mapping could be removed and freed before it was
    flushed from the CPU TLBs.  This could result in a page use-after-
    free.  A local user with access to such a device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-39842

    An integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver
    which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-40307

    A race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,
    which could lead to use-after-free.  A local user permitted to
    access this device (/dev/efi_capsule_loader) could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.  However, this device is normally only
    accessible by the root user.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.260-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

    An integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver
    which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-40307

    A race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,
    which could lead to use-after-free.  A local user permitted to
    access this device (/dev/efi_capsule_loader) could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.  However, this device is normally only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2022-41674, CVE-2022-42719, CVE-2022-42720, CVE-2022-42721, CVE-2022-42722

    Soenke Huster discovered several vulnerabilities in the mac80211
    subsystem triggered by WLAN frames which may result in denial of
    service or the execution or arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.149-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Subject: [stable-backporting the VM_PFNMAP TLB flushing fix (b67fbebd4cf9)](#r)
Date: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 19:35:47 +0200	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <CAG48ez3SEqOPcPCYGHVZv4iqEApujD5VtM3Re-tCKLDEFdEdbg@mail.gmail.com> (<raw>)

commit b67fbebd4cf9 ("mmu_gather: Force tlb-flush VM_PFNMAP vmas")
fixes a TLB flushing bug that probably affects some x86 graphics
drivers, although hitting the bug might be fairly gnarly. Still, it'd
probably be a bad idea to leave it unfixed in the stable kernels that
things like Debian stable rely on.

Unfortunately the way the fix is written, it relies on refactoring
prep work in the three preceding commits, and trying to apply those to
older kernels will result in a bunch of merge conflicts.

Would it be acceptable here to fix the issue in a completely different
way in stable to minimize merge conflicts? Or should the refactoring
prep work and the fix commit all be backported?

A minimal but also completely different fix would be:

Jann reported a race between munmap() and unmap_mapping_range(), where
unmap_mapping_range() will no-op once unmap_vmas() has unlinked the
VMA; however munmap() will not yet have invalidated the TLBs.

Therefore unmap_mapping_range() will complete while there are still
(stale) TLB entries for the specified range.

Mitigate this by force flushing TLBs for VM_PFNMAP ranges.
