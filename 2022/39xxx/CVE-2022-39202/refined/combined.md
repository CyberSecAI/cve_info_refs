# IRC mode parameter confusion in matrix-org/node-irc

Low

[dkasak](/dkasak)
published
GHSA-cq7q-5c67-w39w
Sep 13, 2022

## Package

npm

matrix-appservice-irc
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<0.35.0

## Patched versions

0.35.0

## Description

### Impact

IRC allows you to specify multiple modes in a single mode command. Due to a bug in the underlying matrix-org/node-irc library, affected versions of matrix-appservice-irc perform parsing of such modes incorrectly, potentially resulting in the wrong user being given permissions.

Mode commands can only be executed by privileged users, so this can only be abused if an operator is tricked into running the command on behalf of an attacker.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0.

### Workarounds

Refrain from entering mode commands suggested by untrusted users. Avoid using multiple modes in a single command.

### References

* <https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/13/security-release-of-matrix-appservice-irc-0-35-0-high-severity>

### Credits

Discovered and reported by [Val Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/).

### For more information

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-39202

# Security release of matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0 (High severity)

[Denis Kasak](/author/denis-kasak)

We've released a new version of matrix.org's node-irc 1.3.0 and
matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0, to patch several security issues:

* IRC mode operator confusion (Low, [GHSA-cq7q-5c67-w39w](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-cq7q-5c67-w39w))
* Parsing issue leading to room takeovers (High, [GHSA-xvqg-mv25-rwvw](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-xvqg-mv25-rwvw))
* Undisclosed issue (Moderate, [GHSA-r3p6-cg2c-c4qw](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-r3p6-cg2c-c4qw))

The details of the final vulnerability will be released at a later date,
pending an audit of the codebase to ensure it's not affected by other similar
vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities have been patched in node-irc version 1.3.0 and
matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. You can get the release on
[Github](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases).

The bridges running on the Libera Chat, OFTC and other networks bridged by the
Matrix.org Foundation have been patched.

**Please upgrade your IRC bridge as soon as possible.**

The above vulnerabilities were reported by [Val
Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/). Thank you!

## The Foundation needs you

The Matrix.org Foundation is a non-profit and only relies
on donations to operate. Its core mission is to maintain
the Matrix Specification, but it does much more than that.

It maintains the matrix.org homeserver and hosts several
bridges for free. It fights for our collective rights to
digital privacy and dignity.
