The content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Online Pet Shop We App v1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application has an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the picture upload functionality of the product editing module within the admin panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload allowing malicious files, specifically PHP files, to be uploaded.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted POST request to `/pet_shop/classes/Master.php?f=save_product` with a malicious PHP file disguised as an image file (`img[]`) in the multipart/form-data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable product editing functionality. The provided credentials are `admin/admin123`.
