Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-39368:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly clean up counters used for throttling after a DTLS handshake fails. This means that if handshakes repeatedly fail, the throttling mechanism can reach its threshold and block further processing of records indefinitely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Resource Management:** The core issue is the lack of proper cleanup of handshake-related counters upon failure. This leads to a resource exhaustion scenario where the throttling mechanism, intended to prevent overload, becomes the cause of the denial-of-service.
*   **Missing Error Handling:** The code lacks proper error handling to reset the throttling counters after a handshake failure. This omission makes the system vulnerable to being stuck in a throttled state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. Once the throttling threshold is reached due to repeated handshake failures, the system will permanently drop incoming records, effectively becoming non-responsive. This affects both clients and servers.
*   **Service Disruption:** The inability to process records will disrupt the intended functionality of the DTLS service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Repeated Failed Handshakes:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by initiating DTLS handshakes that are intentionally designed to fail. By sending malformed handshakes, or attempting to connect without valid credentials. This can be achieved from a remote network location, without requiring prior access.
*   **Network-level attacks:** An attacker can cause failed handshakes by disrupting the network, or spoofing packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected server or client.
*   **Ability to Initiate DTLS Handshakes:** The attacker must be able to initiate DTLS handshakes, which may involve basic knowledge of the protocol.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was initially reported for certificate-based handshakes, but it also has the potential to impact PSK-based handshakes.
*   The provided information includes links to the relevant commits that fix the issue, with the fix being to run all pending jobs on connection shutdown to align the counters.
*   The advisory identifies CWE-452 (Unprotected Handler in the case of a shutdown) as a related weakness. However, the advisory indicates “No CWEs”

The vulnerability can be triggered both on the client and server side.

**Summary of Changes:**
The commits mentioned in the advisory address the vulnerability by:
1. Introducing a `LimitedRunnable` class to handle jobs with a counter
2. Running all pending jobs on connection shutdown
3. Adding a method `runAll` to run a list of jobs.
