- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer when parsing X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution by exploiting this vulnerability, though the advisory states "This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process". The advisory also states "An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current process."
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a malicious X_T file. The user must be tricked into opening the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious X_T file and trick a user into opening it with a vulnerable application.
