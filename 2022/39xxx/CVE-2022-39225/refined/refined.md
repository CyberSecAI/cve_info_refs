- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability of a foreign user to write to another user's session object if the session object ID is known. Specifically, a user can modify the `user` field of a session object belonging to another user.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure access control: Foreign users can modify session objects belonging to other users.
    - Lack of validation: The system does not adequately validate if a user is authorized to modify a specific session object.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - A foreign user can assign a session object to their own user.
    - After assignment, the attacker can read any custom fields of that session object.
    - Although the impact is described as "moderate" because it does not allow for direct privilege escalation by taking over a user's session, there is a potential for high severity if custom logic relies on specific session object properties to grant privileges.

- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability if they are able to send requests to the application over the network.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to know the session object ID of another user. This ID can be obtained via brute-force guessing.
    - The attacker needs to have an account with the application to send write requests.
    - The attacker needs to be on the network with the vulnerable server.
