- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The H2 sample database in Metabase allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries, including DDL (Data Definition Language) statements. This capability can be abused to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Improper restriction of SQL query capabilities, specifically allowing DDL statements on H2 databases.
  - Remote Code Execution vulnerability due to the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Remote code execution can be achieved by users able to write SQL queries on H2 databases.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, including DDL statements, on the H2 database via the application interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  The attacker needs to be able to write SQL queries on H2 databases, which likely implies having access to the Metabase application with the required privileges.
