This document discusses security vulnerabilities in Flowring's Agentflow product, specifically versions v4.0, v3.7.0, and v3.7.1, and provides a patch for those vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system did not properly restrict the types of files that could be uploaded.
- **Broken Access Control:** Incomplete access control allowed for manipulation of URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload, allowing for the potential upload of malicious files.
- Broken access control, allowing for unauthorized access or manipulation of data through URL parameter manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious files could be uploaded and potentially executed, leading to system compromise.
- Unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading malicious files through the file upload functionality of the application.
- Manipulating URL parameters to bypass access controls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to access the file upload functionality of the vulnerable Agentflow application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server and manipulate URL parameters.
