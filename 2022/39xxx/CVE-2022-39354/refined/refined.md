Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39354:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `is_static` parameter, intended to indicate whether a call is executed within a static context (using the `STATICCALL` opcode), was not being correctly passed to custom stateful precompiles.
- The `is_static` parameter was set to `true` only when a direct `STATICCALL` opcode initiated the call, but it failed to maintain this state for subsequent calls within the static context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect `is_static` parameter passed to custom precompiles.
- Failure to maintain the static context for subsequent calls within a static context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Incorrect state transitions for custom precompiles which relied on the is_static flag.
- Potential for unexpected and erroneous behaviour in affected precompiles.
- The advisory mentions that the impact was high for affected custom precompiles because incorrect state transitions can occur if the precompile assumes it can modify state, when it shouldn't.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor could trigger a series of calls that involve `STATICCALL` to a stateful precompile, exploiting the incorrect handling of the `is_static` parameter.
- This can be achieved by triggering specific code execution paths in smart contracts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to deploy or interact with smart contracts that use a custom precompile.
- Knowledge of the specific vulnerable precompile and how it handles state.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects evm versions <= 0.35.0.
- It was patched in version 0.36.0.
- The vulnerability is specific to custom stateful precompiles that utilize the `is_static` parameter.
- The maintainers estimated a low usage of vulnerable precompiles.
