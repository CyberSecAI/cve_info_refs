# Possible Phishing attacks through Swagger UI

Moderate

[DerLinkman](/DerLinkman)
published
GHSA-vjgf-cp5p-wm45
Sep 27, 2022

## Package

Swagger UI
(mailcow-dockerized)

## Affected versions

< 2022-09

## Patched versions

>= 2022-09

## Description

### Impact

It allows an attacker to craft a custom swagger api template, being possible to spoof Authorize links redirecting a victim to an attacker controller place in order to steal swagger authorization credentials or create a phishing page to steal credit card information

### Patches

The issue has been fixed with the 2022-09 mailcow Mootember Update.

### Workarounds

Delete the Swapper API Documentation from your E-Mail Server (mostly located under: `data/web/api`).

### Reproduction

Mostly all mailcow instances have a active swagger instance with url import enabled.

With that a configUrl parameter followed by a template can be passed to the URL:

<https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AMontesG/54d92f04ea29385602670e81db2f3888/raw/124dc444aea84ac0a2a0d8f76f86b9e192123aa6/card.json>

The api template template can be hosted in an attacker's server in order to be imported, this template contains custom html tags, this one for example would allow an attacker to steal credit card information :

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62480600/192548784-a3fe1fa1-5c01-4756-b7a5-6d7556897fdc.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62480600/192548784-a3fe1fa1-5c01-4756-b7a5-6d7556897fdc.png)

With that the attacker only needs to send the swagger UI link with its crafted template to a victim, in this case the url would be :

<https://mail.yourhostname.tld/api/index.html?configUrl=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AMontesG/54d92f04ea29385602670e81db2f3888/raw/124dc444aea84ac0a2a0d8f76f86b9e192123aa6/card.json>
