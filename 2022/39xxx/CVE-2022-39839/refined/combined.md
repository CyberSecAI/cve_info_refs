| This thing is available only to administrators. This is related to the HTML Purifier settings. Administrators have more permissions than regular users.  It is needed to disable JavaScript in HTMLPurifier somehow for admins too. |

| `<script>` tags are disabled in HTMLPurifier for admins too  Creating blacklists is not best practice, you should use whitelist. For example, you disable the <script> tag, but the payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` will work. For a comprehensive list, check out the [DOMPurify allowlist](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/blob/main/src/attrs.js). |

| Are you suggesting to make a whitelist with all possible valid options, except for the <script> tag :)?  but the payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`  Really? I can't reproduce this case.  Moreover, this situation is only possible if administrator will save text with the XSS script. Regular users has more stricter HTMLPurifier settings. |

Moreover, this situation is only possible if administrator will save text with the XSS script. Regular users has more stricter HTMLPurifier settings.  He is saying to **only** **allow** (whitelist) e.g. plain text. Thus you will automatically reject everything else. |
