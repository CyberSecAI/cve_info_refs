Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the transmission of sensitive information, specifically OIDC client credentials and tokens, in cleartext over HTTP connections. The `user_oidc` application was not enforcing the use of HTTPS for communication, leading to exposure of sensitive data when HTTP was used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission:** The primary weakness is the lack of encryption for sensitive data in transit. This directly violates confidentiality and makes the credentials vulnerable to interception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker intercepting the cleartext HTTP traffic could obtain OIDC client credentials and tokens.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** With stolen credentials/tokens, an attacker could potentially impersonate a user or gain access to resources within the Nextcloud environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** The attack vector is a network-based attack where an attacker intercepts HTTP traffic between the client and the Nextcloud server. This could occur via man-in-the-middle attacks on a network the client is connected to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the server to intercept the unencrypted traffic.
*   **Passive Monitoring:** The attacker can passively sniff network traffic without needing to interact directly with the client or server.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is addressed in `user_oidc` version 1.2.1 by enforcing the use of HTTPS for login and code endpoints, rejecting HTTP requests to those endpoints.
*  **Workarounds:**  Prior to patching, the suggested workarounds include ensuring that Nextcloud is accessed via HTTPS and that the OIDC provider is configured with an HTTPS discovery URL.
*   **CVSS:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 3.5, with the following base metrics:
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: High
    *   User Interaction: Required
    *   Scope: Unchanged
    *   Confidentiality: Low
    *   Integrity: Low
    *   Availability: None
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.
