# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

### @julien-nc **[julien-nc](/julien-nc)** commented [Aug 31, 2022](#issue-1357498483)

Performing the login flow with HTTP reveals/exposes secret information. Login and code endpoints are now rejecting HTTP requests.

[OpenId specs regarding TLS](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TLSRequirements) are not very clear but can be interpreted as "better use HTTPS".

I took the opportunity to make some polishing to the Login controller. I hope this is not too out of scope 😁.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Looks good, now running integration tests in debug mode should also pass again :)
