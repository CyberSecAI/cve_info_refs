{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The symmetric key used for encrypting/decrypting secure variables/secrets within GoCD configuration was accidentally being serialized and sent to authenticated agents.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of sensitive information due to improper data handling during serialization of material objects.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious or compromised agent could access and expose the encryption/decryption key from memory allowing decryption of secrets intended for other agents or environments if they have access to the encrypted configuration values from the GoCD server.",
  "Attack vectors": "A compromised or malicious GoCD agent.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have control over a GoCD agent that is authenticated with the GoCD server and be able to access the memory of the agent process."
