- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing specially crafted X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads specially crafted X_T files. An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a malicious file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious X_T file to a user of the vulnerable software.
