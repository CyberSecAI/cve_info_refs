- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Script-related HTML tags in asset inventory information are not properly neutralized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), specifically CWE-80.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, manipulation of data, or other malicious activities within the context of a user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. The vulnerability is triggered through the web interface where the asset inventory information is displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious script within the asset inventory, which would then be executed when a user views the asset information.
