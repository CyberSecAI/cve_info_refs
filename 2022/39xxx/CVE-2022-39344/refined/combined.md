# DFU UPLOAD buffer overflow revised

High

[liydu](/liydu)
published
GHSA-m9p8-xrp7-vvqp
Nov 3, 2022

## Package

USBX
(Azure RTOS)

## Affected versions

< 6.1.12

## Patched versions

6.1.12

## Description

### Impact

The USB DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code.

The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function prevents buffer overflow during handling of DFU UPLOAD command when current state is `UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_IDLE`. Validation for this condition is implemented as in the following snippet.

```
case UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD:

/* bitCanUpload != 1, or length = 0, or length > wTransferSize (we can support max of control buffer size). */
if (!(_ux_system_slave -> ux_system_slave_device_dfu_capabilities &amp; UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_CAPABILITY_CAN_UPLOAD) ||
(request_length == 0) ||
(request_length > UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH))
{
_ux_device_stack_endpoint_stall(&amp;device -> ux_slave_device_control_endpoint);

/* In the system, state the DFU state machine to DFU ERROR. */
_ux_system_slave -> ux_system_slave_device_dfu_state_machine = UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_ERROR;

break;
}
```

Once a correct DFU UPLOAD control request transfer is handled the DFU state machine transitions to `UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_UPLOAD_IDLE` state which lacks the required validation.

```
case UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_STATUS_STATE_DFU_UPLOAD_IDLE:

/* Here we process only the request we can accept in the DFU mode UPLOAD IDLE state. */
switch (request)
{

case UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD:

/* Length 0 case undefined, just keep state. */
if (request_length == 0)
break;

/* We received a UPLOAD command with length > 0. */

/* Read the next block from the firmware. */
status = dfu -> ux_slave_class_dfu_read(dfu, request_value,
transfer_request -> ux_slave_transfer_request_data_pointer,
request_length,
&amp;actual_length);

/* Application can actively reject and set error state. */
if (status != UX_SUCCESS)
{
_ux_device_stack_endpoint_stall(&amp;device -> ux_slave_device_control_endpoint);
_ux_system_slave -> ux_system_slave_device_dfu_state_machine = UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_ERROR;
break;
}

/* If it&#39;s short frame, switch to dfu IDLE. */
if (actual_length &lt; request_length)
{

/* Send a notification to the application. */
dfu -> ux_slave_class_dfu_notify(dfu, UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_NOTIFICATION_END_UPLOAD);

/* In the system, state the DFU state machine to dfu IDLE. */
_ux_system_slave -> ux_system_slave_device_dfu_state_machine = UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_IDLE;
}

/* We have a request to upload DFU firmware block. */
_ux_device_stack_transfer_request(transfer_request, actual_length, request_length);

break;
```

With state machine in `UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_STATUS_STATE_DFU_UPLOAD_IDLE` processing a control transfer request for `UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD` with `wLenght` greater than `UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH` will result in a buffer overflow (`dfu->ux_slave_class_dfu_read` will overflow the `UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH` buffer) which in turn may result in a RCE with attacker code injected to flash either by utilizing DFU DOWNLOAD command or manipulating contents of an external flash chip (when used).

### Patches

We analyzed this bug and determined that we needed to fix it. This fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel)

### Workarounds

Add the `UPLOAD_LENGTH` check in all possible states
