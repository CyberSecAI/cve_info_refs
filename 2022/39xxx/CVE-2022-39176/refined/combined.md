Package        : bluez
Version        : 5.50-1.2~deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-8921 CVE-2019-8922 CVE-2021-41229 CVE-2021-43400
                 CVE-2022-0204 CVE-2022-39176 CVE-2022-39177
Debian Bug     : 998626 1000262 1003712

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BlueZ, the Linux Bluetooth
protocol stack. An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or
leak information.

CVE-2019-8921

    SDP infoleak, the vulnerability lies in the handling of a
    SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a
    malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into
    returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in
    leaking arbitrary heap data.

CVE-2019-8922

    SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol
    handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge
    number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow
    the static buffer provided to hold the response.

CVE-2021-41229

    sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in
    the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will
    cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large
    object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending
    sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to
    crash.

CVE-2021-43400

    A use-after-free in gatt-database.c can occur when a client
    disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue call.

CVE-2022-0204

    A heap overflow vulnerability was found in bluez. An attacker with
    local network access could pass specially crafted files causing an
    application to halt or crash, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2022-39176

    BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive
    information because profiles/audio/avrcp.c does not validate
    params_len.

CVE-2022-39177

    BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of
    service because malformed and invalid capabilities can be
    processed in profiles/audio/avdtp.c.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.50-1.2~deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.

its security tracker page at:
