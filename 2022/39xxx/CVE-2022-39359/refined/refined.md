Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-39359

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the GeoJSON URL fetching logic in Metabase was following redirects without properly validating the final destination URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-200 (Information Exposure):** By following redirects, the application could potentially expose internal network resources or services that should not be publicly accessible.
- **Inadequate URL Validation:** The application was not correctly validating the final destination of a redirected GeoJSON URL, allowing it to potentially access blocked or internal resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially bypass restrictions on accessing local network resources or private IPs.
- This could lead to information disclosure, as the attacker could access internal GeoJSON files that were not intended to be exposed.
- The impact is considered High, as internal resources could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can specify a custom GeoJSON URL in the Metabase settings which redirects to a disallowed URL (e.g., private IP addresses or local network resources).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to configure or modify custom GeoJSON settings within the Metabase application.
- They must have the ability to set a malicious URL for the GeoJSON source.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is fixed by disabling following redirects on GeoJSON map URLs.
- An environment variable `MB_CUSTOM_GEOJSON_ENABLED` was added to disable custom GeoJSON completely.
- The fix prevents the application from following redirects when fetching GeoJSON data from a provided URL.
- The affected versions are prior to: 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9 and 1.41.9.
