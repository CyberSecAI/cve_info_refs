The provided content is related to CVE-2022-39393.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in Wasmtime's pooling instance allocator. When a linear memory slot is reused, the initial heap snapshot of a previous instance might become visible to the next instance. This happens when the first module has a heap image and the next module in the same slot does not, resulting in the old heap image not being cleared before the new instantiation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Data leakage: A module without a heap image can access the initial heap data of a previous module that used the same memory slot.
- Memory corruption: If a module with a heap image is later instantiated in the same slot, the state tracking can be incorrect. This can lead to a crash or segfault when the host accesses unmapped memory, which the host believes is mapped.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: A module can access potentially sensitive data from a prior module instance.
- Denial of Service: When a reused slot is accessed by a subsequent module with an image, a segfault on the host can result.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered using the pooling allocator in Wasmtime.
- The attacker needs to control module instantiation to cause the reuse of the same memory slot and ensure that modules with and without heap images are loaded sequentially into the same slot.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to configure the Wasmtime to use the pooling allocator.
- The attacker needs to be able to create modules with and without heap images.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the order in which the modules are instantiated to trigger the bug.

The vulnerability requires the use of the pooling allocator and copy-on-write heap images, both of which are not enabled by default. Specifically crafting wasm modules is also required to trigger the issue.
