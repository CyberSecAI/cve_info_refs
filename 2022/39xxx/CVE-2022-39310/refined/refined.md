  "CVE-2022-39310": {
    "Description": "GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 can allow one authenticated agent to impersonate another agent, and thus receive work packages for other agents due to broken access control and incorrect validation of agent tokens within the GoCD server. Since work packages can contain sensitive information such as credentials intended only for a given job running against a specific agent environment, this can cause accidental information disclosure. Exploitation requires knowledge of agent identifiers and ability to authenticate as an existing agent with the GoCD server.",
    "Root cause": "Broken access control and incorrect validation of agent tokens within the GoCD server",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Incorrect validation of agent tokens"
    ],
    "Impact": "One authenticated agent can impersonate another agent, leading to unauthorized access to work packages and potential disclosure of sensitive information like credentials intended for a specific job/agent environment.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Knowledge of agent identifiers and ability to authenticate as an existing agent with the GoCD server.",
    "Additional Details": "The UUID to perform work was sourced from the deserialized object stream and not verified to be the same UUID that was permitted by the authentication filter. Essentially, an authenticated client could request work for any arbitrary agent. This would give access to decrypted secrets for a build."
