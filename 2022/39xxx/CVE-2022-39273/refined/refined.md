Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-39273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of Flyte's internal OAuth2 authorization server.  To simplify initial setup, a hardcoded, hashed client secret for Flyte Propeller was included. If users enabled authentication without overriding this default, they would unknowingly expose their system because the default hashed password was also present in the default Flyte Propeller configuration. This allows an attacker to impersonate Propeller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Client Secret:** The primary weakness is the use of a hardcoded, hashed secret in the default configuration of Flyte Admin.
*   **Default Configuration Exposure:** The default settings allow access for Flyte Propeller using this hardcoded secret even after turning on authentication, effectively bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Lack of Awareness:** Users might enable authentication without realizing that they need to override the default client secret, thus leaving themselves vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Impersonation:** Attackers can impersonate Flyte Propeller, a core component of the Flyte platform. This impersonation can allow unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Public Traffic Access:** The default password can enable public traffic to enter the Flyte system, bypassing the security intended by enabling auth, potentially leading to data breaches or other unauthorized activities.
* **Data Breach or System Compromise:** An attacker could perform unauthorized actions within the Flyte platform, potentially modifying, deleting, or accessing sensitive data/resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the Flyte Admin service could exploit this vulnerability.
*  **Impersonation through default credentials:** If the default configuration of Flyte's internal OAuth2 authorization server is used, and authentication is enabled by the administrator, an attacker could provide the known default secret and impersonate propeller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to Flyte Admin:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the Flyte Admin service.
*   **Knowledge of the Default Secret:** The attacker must know the hardcoded hashed password. This is publicly known due to the nature of the vulnerability.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to users who enable Flyte's internal authorization server and do not override the default client secret.
*   Users using an external authorization server are not affected.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.1.44.
*   Workarounds involve manually setting staticClients in the selfAuthServer section of the configuration or using an external auth server.
