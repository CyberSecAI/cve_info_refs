published
GHSA-434f-f5cw-3rj6
Dec 19, 2023

## Package

hertzbeat
(hertzbeat)

## Affected versions

<=1.2.0

## Patched versions

>1.2.0

## Description

### Impact

hertzbeat <= 1.20 has a permission bypass vulnerability

Permission bypass is a Web security vulnerability. It can bypass system authentication and invoke interfaces without authorization. As a result, the site is in an insecure state, such as directly invoking interfaces used by administrators.

### Patches

You are advised to upgrade to the latest version.

### Workarounds

You are advised to upgrade to the latest version.

### References

<https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat>

### For more information

sureness filters excludeResource first. If a match is successful, Sureness allows excluderesource directly. If not, Sureness enters the subsequent authentication process. Here because of the use of; A request url such as.json causes the exclude block to be matched, allowing the request to be released. This request is also released due to the springbolt interface feature `/aaa; .json` will go to `/aaa`.
