- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer when parsing specially crafted X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted X_T file. An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a malicious file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious X_T file and trick a user into opening it with the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any special privileges or network access. The vulnerability is triggered locally on the user's machine after the user opens the file.
