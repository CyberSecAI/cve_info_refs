Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of a GLPI administrator to define rich-text content that is displayed on the login page. This content is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-provided rich-text input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code that will be stored and then executed in the browsers of users who visit the login page. This is a form of stored XSS since the malicious payload is persisted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can use the injected malicious code to steal user credentials when they attempt to log in. This could be done by redirecting the login form to a malicious server or by capturing the entered credentials via a malicious script embedded in the page.
*   **Other Malicious Activities:** The injected code could potentially be used for other malicious activities, such as session hijacking or defacing the login page itself, if more complex attacks are devised.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** The exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to access potentially sensitive information through the compromised session of an administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based since the attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely by injecting code through the GLPI application's configuration interface, which is accessible over the network.
*   **Administrator Access Required (Indirect):** Although the vulnerability is an XSS, it requires a high privileged user i.e., administrator to set up the attack via the configuration for the login page.  However, the users who are targeted are not necessarily administrators.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GLPI Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the GLPI system to configure the rich-text content on the login page.
*   **Knowledge of GLPI:** The attacker requires a basic knowledge of the GLPI system and its configuration options related to the login page.
*   **Understanding of XSS:** The attacker must understand how to craft malicious code that can be executed within the context of the login page, targeting the credentials of other users.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as "moderate" severity, with a CVSS score of 5.2.
*   Affected versions are GLPI versions 0.65 and above, prior to the patch.
*   The patch is in version 10.0.4.
* The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-39262 and CWE-83 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page)
