# NODE\_ENV defaults to development with esbuild

Critical

[dcousens](/dcousens)
published
GHSA-25mx-2mxm-6343
Nov 3, 2022

## Package

npm

@keystone-6/core
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

3.0.0,3.0.1

## Patched versions

3.0.2

## Description

### Impact

`@keystone-6/core@3.0.0 || 3.0.1` users that use `NODE_ENV` in their own code (**not dependencies**) to trigger security-sensitive functionality in a production build are vulnerable to `NODE_ENV` being inlined to `"development"` for user code.

If your dependencies use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviours (optimisations, security or otherwise), they should still respect your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable and thereby be unaffected.

If you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your own code to trigger security-sensitive functionality, **you are not impacted** by this vulnerability.

An example of code that would be affected, might be the following:

```
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  // this code would unintentionally run in your production builds
}
```
### Technical Description

The problem comes from esbuild defaulting `NODE_ENV` to `"development"` when a platform configuration is undefined.

You can read about why [`esbuild` has that behaviour in their documentation](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#platform), but the result for Keystone users is that user Typescript was compiled, and had inlined `NODE_ENV` to the constant `"development"`.

Your application's dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. Therefore any libraries that used `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviours (optimisations, security or otherwise) should still respect your environment's `NODE_ENV`.

We have tested this assumption by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`.

Thereby, the severity of this vulnerability is dependent on what functionality users conditionally triggered, in their own code, depending on the expectation that `NODE_ENV` would be correctly configured in their application. In accordance with Common Vulnerability Scoring System `2.3.3. Assume Vulnerable Configurations`, this security advisory assumes vulnerable configurations and is thus marked as *critical*, but you should evaluate the true security impact for your application to determine a relevant score.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been fixed in `@keystone-6/core@3.0.2`, thanks to [@mmachatschek](https://github.com/mmachatschek) in [#8031](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8031).

We have added regression tests for this vulnerability in [#8063](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8063).

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade your `@keystone-6/core` version for any reason, your best alternative is to remove any code that uses `NODE_ENV` in a way that may reasonably impact your application security.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
