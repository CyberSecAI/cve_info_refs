      "root_cause": "The matrix-ios-sdk implemented a too permissive key forwarding strategy, accepting keys forwarded by other users even if the client didn't request them.",

        "Insecure key forwarding implementation."

        "A malicious homeserver can forward keys to a victim client, allowing the attacker to impersonate another user by sending messages that appear to come from the impersonated user."

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a malicious homeserver and have knowledge of the target user's room keys or be able to generate fake key forwarding events. The attacker needs to have an account on the malicious server and to have previously interacted with the victim user."
