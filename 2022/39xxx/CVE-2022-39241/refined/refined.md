- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) protections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly restrict outbound network connections, allowing attackers to trigger requests to private IP addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **End-users** could trigger HTTP GET requests to private IPs, but would not be able to obtain detailed information about the response.
    - **Forum administrators** could trigger HTTP GET/POST requests to private IPs and view information about the response. They could also trigger a `git clone` to private IPs using HTTP or SSH, but would only view the response if it was a Discourse Theme repository.
    -  The high severity reflects a worst-case scenario where admins are untrusted and sensitive services exist on the internal network.
- **Attack vectors**: Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - End-users can trigger HTTP GET requests to private IPs.
    - Forum administrators can trigger HTTP GET/POST requests and `git clone` commands to private IPs.
    - Exploitation requires high privileges.
