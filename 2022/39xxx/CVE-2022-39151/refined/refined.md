- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing specially crafted X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses specially crafted X_T files. An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious X_T file to a user of the affected software. The user must then open the file using the vulnerable software.
