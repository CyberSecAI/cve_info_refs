We've released a new version of matrix.org's node-irc 1.3.0 and
matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0, to patch several security issues:

* IRC mode operator confusion (Low, [GHSA-cq7q-5c67-w39w](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-cq7q-5c67-w39w))
* Parsing issue leading to room takeovers (High, [GHSA-xvqg-mv25-rwvw](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-xvqg-mv25-rwvw))
* Undisclosed issue (Moderate, [GHSA-r3p6-cg2c-c4qw](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-r3p6-cg2c-c4qw))

The details of the final vulnerability will be released at a later date,
pending an audit of the codebase to ensure it's not affected by other similar
vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities have been patched in node-irc version 1.3.0 and
matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. You can get the release on
[Github](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases).

The bridges running on the Libera Chat, OFTC and other networks bridged by the
Matrix.org Foundation have been patched.

**Please upgrade your IRC bridge as soon as possible.**

The above vulnerabilities were reported by [Val
Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/). Thank you!

## Package

npm

matrix-appservice-irc
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<0.35.0

## Patched versions

0.35.0

## Description

### Impact

Attackers can specify a specific string of characters, which would confuse the bridge into combining an attacker-owned channel and an existing channel, allowing them to grant themselves permissions in the channel.

### Patched

The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0.

### Workarounds

Disable dynamic channel joining via `dynamicChannels.enabled` to prevent users from joining new channels, which prevents any new channels being bridged outside of what is already bridged, and what is specified in the config.
