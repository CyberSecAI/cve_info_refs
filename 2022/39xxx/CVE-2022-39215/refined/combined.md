# The readDir Endpoint Scope can be Bypassed With Symbolic Links

Low

[tweidinger](/tweidinger)
published
GHSA-28m8-9j7v-x499
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

Tauri
(Tauri-Apps)

## Affected versions

< 1.0.6

## Patched versions

1.1.0,1.0.6

## Description

### Impact

Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked.

### Patches

The issue has been resolved in [#5123](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123) and the implementation now properly checks if the

requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`.

### Workarounds

Disable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.

### For more information

This issue was initially reported by [martin-ocasek](https://github.com/martin-ocasek) in [#4882](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4882).

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)
* Email us at security@tauri.app

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-39215

### Weaknesses

[CWE-548](/advisories?query=cwe%3A548)

### **[martin-ocasek](/martin-ocasek)** commented [Aug 7, 2022](#issue-1331083809)

| Describe the bug When a junction is created in the $APP Base directory on windows eg. `mklink /J C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\<identifier>\TestFolder C:\Dev\TestFolder`) The folder is accessible together with all files and folders inside using fs if read from the root directory `const entries = await readDir('', { dir: BaseDirectory.App, recursive: true });` But when trying to read the folder directly using `const entries = await readDir('TestFolder', { dir: BaseDirectory.App, recursive: true });` it fails with an error `Uncaught (in promise) path not allowed on the configured scope: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\<identifier>\TestFolder` Reproduction  1. Create Junction in $APP directory 2. Try to access that directory recursively with readDir with empty dir parameter 3. Folder and its contents can be read 4. Try to access that directory again with readDir but with the name of the directory as dir parameter  Expected behavior I would expect to either not be able to access the folder at all, or be able to access it directly as well if it is accessible from root recursively.
