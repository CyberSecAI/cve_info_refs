Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The ZoneMinder web application did not properly enforce CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for actions performed via HTTP GET requests. It only checked for CSRF tokens on POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Bypass:** The application's logic allowed bypassing CSRF protection by using HTTP GET requests instead of the expected HTTP POST.
*   **Lack of HTTP Method Enforcement:** The application did not strictly enforce that certain actions should only be performed through POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could trick an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on the ZoneMinder web application.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** As demonstrated in the example, an attacker could potentially delete users or modify system settings. The impact of the attack depends on what actions the application allows.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL (using GET method) that, when visited by an authenticated user, executes actions without CSRF validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ZoneMinder instance.
*   **Knowledge of Target Action:** The attacker must be aware of the specific actions that can be triggered via HTTP GET requests.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a logged-in user to be tricked into visiting the attacker's malicious link or performing actions specified in the attacker's crafted HTTP GET requests. This could be done through methods such as a phishing link or by embedding it on another web page.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided github commit diff shows how the vulnerability was fixed by only allowing actions via POST requests and removing the ability to trigger actions through GET requests.

In summary, CVE-2022-39290 is a CSRF bypass vulnerability in ZoneMinder that arises from a lack of consistent CSRF protection across HTTP methods. An attacker can exploit this by tricking an authenticated user into performing unauthorized actions through a crafted URL (GET method).
