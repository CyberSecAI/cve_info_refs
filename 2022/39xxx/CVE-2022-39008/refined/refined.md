Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-39008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Bundle serialization/deserialization mismatch.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the way the NFC module handles the serialization and deserialization of data bundles. A mismatch in this process can lead to unexpected behavior and security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows third-party applications to read and write arbitrary files belonging to system applications. This could lead to data corruption, information leaks, or complete takeover of affected system components.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves malicious third-party applications exploiting the deserialization/serialization process within the NFC module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to install a third-party application on the affected device.
    - The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability and how to exploit it through the NFC module.

**Affected Versions:** EMUI 12.0.0
