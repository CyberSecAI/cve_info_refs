{
  "CVE-2022-39958": {
    "root_cause": "The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is vulnerable to a response body bypass by sequentially exfiltrating small and undetectable sections of data using an HTTP Range header with a small byte range.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Response body bypass due to insufficient checks on Range header values."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the WAF and exfiltrate sensitive data from the backend by requesting small chunks of a protected resource through repeated Range header requests. This can lead to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending multiple HTTP requests with a specially crafted Range header, specifying a small byte range.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
  }
