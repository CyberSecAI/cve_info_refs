{
  "CVE-2022-39246": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The matrix-android-sdk2 implemented a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end, allowing an attacker to construct messages appearing to have come from another person.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the matrix-android-sdk2 handles key forwarding, making it overly permissive.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, working with a malicious homeserver, can create messages that appear to have originated from another user. This could lead to impersonation and potentially trick users into believing they are communicating with the wrong party.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack involves a malicious homeserver and an attacker who can craft specific messages using the overly permissive key forwarding mechanism.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to cooperate with a malicious homeserver in order to exploit the vulnerability."
