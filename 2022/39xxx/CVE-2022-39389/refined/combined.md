# Witness Block Parsing DoS Vulnerability

High

[Roasbeef](/Roasbeef)
published
GHSA-hc82-w9v8-83pr
Nov 17, 2022

## Package

gomod

btcd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v0.23.3

## Patched versions

v0.23.3

gomod

lnd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

< v0.15.4-beta

v0.15.4-beta

## Description

### Impact

All lnd nodes before version `v0.15.4` are vulnerable to a block parsing bug that can cause a node to enter a degraded state once encountered. In this degraded state, nodes can continue to make payments and forward HTLCs, and close out channels. Opening channels is prohibited, and also on chain transaction events will be undetected.

This can cause loss of funds if a CSV expiry is researched during a breach attempt or a CLTV delta expires forgetting the funds in the HTLC.

### Patches

A patch is available starting with lnd `v0.15.4`.

### Workarounds

Nodes can use the `lncli updatechanpolicy` RPC call to increase their CLTV value to a very high amount or increase their fee policies. This will prevent nodes from routing through your node, meaning that no pending HTLCs can be present.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

This is an emergency hot fix release to fix a bug that can cause lnd nodes to be unable to parse certain transactions that have a very large number of witness inputs.

This release contains no major features, and is instead just a hotfix applied on top of v0.15.3.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/scripts/keys/guggero.asc | gpg --import

```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-guggero-v0.15.4-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.15.4-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-guggero-v0.15.4-beta.sig manifest-v0.15.4-beta.txt

```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Di 01 Nov 2022 14:00:20 CET
gpg:                using RSA key F4FC70F07310028424EFC20A8E4256593F177720
gpg: Good signature from "Oliver Gugger <gugger@gmail.com>" [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 <filename>`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the *git tag* with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts:  `manifest-guggero-v0.15.4-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands:

```
ots verify manifest-guggero-v0.15.4-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-guggero-v0.15.4-beta.sig

```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally.

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires.

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.

The release binaries are compiled with `go1.18.2`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.

They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `neutrinorpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc`, `monitoring`, `peersrpc`, `kvdb_postrgres`, and `kvdb_etcd`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=<OS-ARCH> tag=<tag>` can be used.

Finally, you can also verify the *tag* itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.15.4-beta
gpg: Signature made Di 01 Nov 2022 13:45:40 CET
gpg:                using RSA key F4FC70F07310028424EFC20A8E4256593F177720
gpg: Good signature from "Oliver Gugger <gugger@gmail.com>"

```
## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint="" lightninglabs/lnd:v0.15.4-beta /verify-install.sh v0.15.4-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ "$OK" -ne "0" ]; then echo "Verification failed!"; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```
# Building the Contained Release

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming

that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.15.4-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.15.4-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags "-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.15.4-beta" ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags "-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.15.4-beta" ./cmd/lncli

```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory.

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a *specific* system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191):

```
make release sys="linux-arm64 darwin-amd64"

```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️
