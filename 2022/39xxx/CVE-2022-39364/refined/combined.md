# Unable to connect to 2FA-enabled O365 OneDrive #141

[New issue](/login?return_to=)[Jump to bottom](#comment-composer-heading)Copy link[New issue](/login?return_to=)[Jump to bottom](#comment-composer-heading)Copy linkOpenOpen[Unable to connect to 2FA-enabled O365 OneDrive](#top)#141Copy link![@didierm](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/989004?v=4&size=80)
## Description

![@didierm](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/989004?v=4&size=48)[didierm](https://github.com/didierm)opened [on Jul 26, 2022](https://github.com/nextcloud/sharepoint/issues/141#issue-1318167987)
### Steps to reproduce

1. install nextcloud/sharepoint app
2. create O365 OneDrive external storage, according to provided documentation at <https://github.com/nextcloud/sharepoint#how-to-add-office-365-onedrive>

### Expected behaviour

connectivity to the (Sharepoint-based) O365 OneDrive share

### Actual behaviour

NextCloud error :

**"External mount error

There was an error with message: Empty response from the server"**

### Server configuration

NC21

### More info

* The O365 OneDrive share is protected with 2FA (TOTP).
* The nextcloud/sharepoint app documentation is copied verbatim from rclone (with its reference : <https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint-online> ), but omits this specific (and essential) rclone clause : *"... If you have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password. ..."*

If nextcloud/sharepoint is unable to cope with 2FA, this should be highlighted in the documentation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
