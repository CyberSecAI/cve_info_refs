Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the Nextcloud Sharepoint app was logging exception details, including clear-text credentials used to connect to a SharePoint service, into the `nextcloud.log` file. This occurs due to the application not sanitizing or excluding sensitive information when logging exceptions related to SharePoint connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Clear-text credential logging (CWE-312):** The primary vulnerability is the logging of sensitive credentials in plain text within the application logs. This exposes credentials if an attacker gains access to the logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** If an attacker gains access to the `nextcloud.log` file, they can obtain credentials to connect to the SharePoint service. This could lead to unauthorized access to the organization's SharePoint data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker must have access to the server where Nextcloud is running and the `nextcloud.log` file is stored.
*   **Log Access:** The attacker needs to be able to read the Nextcloud server's log files. This might require a high level of privilege on the server itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges on the Nextcloud server to access the `nextcloud.log` file.
*   **Server Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the server, either directly (via SSH for example) or potentially via other means (such as a compromised account).
*   **Knowledge of Log Location:** The attacker needs to know where the `nextcloud.log` file is stored on the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Nextcloud Server versions prior to 23.0.9 and 24.0.5, and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions before 22.2.10.5, 23.0.9, and 24.0.5.
*   The issue was fixed by modifying the logging behavior to prevent sensitive information from being written to logs, by ignoring arguments of sharepoint related methods during logging.
*   A temporary workaround was provided which involves disabling argument logging in php ini. (`zend.exception_ignore_args = On`)
*   The issue was tracked and fixed in related pull requests (`https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/33689`)
*   The issue was initially reported in `https://github.com/nextcloud/sharepoint/issues/141`

The vulnerability is considered "moderate" severity, with a CVSS v3 score of 4.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
