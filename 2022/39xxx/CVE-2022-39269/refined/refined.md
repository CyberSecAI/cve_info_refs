Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39269:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect switch from Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) to basic Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) during SRTP restarts when processing specific packets. This occurs within the PJSIP library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Improper handling of SRTP restarts, leading to a downgrade to insecure RTP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Media traffic is sent unencrypted, compromising the confidentiality of communication. An attacker could potentially eavesdrop on the media stream.

**Attack vectors:**
-   Sending specific packets that trigger the faulty SRTP restart logic within the PJSIP library. This could be done remotely by an attacker capable of sending packets to a vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system running a vulnerable version of PJSIP.
-   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the packets in such a way that triggers the SRTP restart condition.
-   No specific local access is required

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects PJSIP versions from 2.11 up to and including 2.12.1. It is fixed in version 2.13 and later.
- The vulnerability is considered "Critical" in severity.
- The provided patch modifies `pjmedia/src/pjmedia/transport_srtp.c` to correct the SRTP restart logic. The fix involves stopping the existing SRTP stream, setting the policy, and then starting it again, thus ensuring proper handling of the rollover counter..
