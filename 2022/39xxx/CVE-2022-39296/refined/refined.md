Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the `melisplatform/melis-asset-manager` module. It arises from insufficient checks on user-provided file paths when displaying files, allowing attackers to access files outside of the intended directories.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application does not properly validate or sanitize file paths, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path to access files outside the intended webroot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or user data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the URI to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directories.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker does not need authentication to perform this attack.
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate the URI to perform path traversal.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented in commit `a0f75918c049aff78953a0bc91c585153595d1bd` adds checks to ensure that requested files are within the intended directory using the `checkFileInFolder` method. The method uses `realpath()` to resolve symlinks before checking if the resolved path starts with the intended directory.
- The affected versions are `melisplatform/melis-asset-manager` versions `<= 5`. The vulnerability is fixed in version `5.0.1`.
