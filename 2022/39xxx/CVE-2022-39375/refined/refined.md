- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input when creating a public RSS feed, which allows injecting malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the dashboard of other users through a crafted public RSS feed, potentially leading to data theft or unauthorized actions within the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, achieved by crafting a malicious public RSS feed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a public RSS feed, which likely requires a high level of privileges within the application (e.g., administrative access or the ability to manage RSS feeds). User interaction (victim visiting dashboard) is required for the exploitation to occur.
