Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39831:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `read_bytes_internal` function within the `utilities/pspp-dump-sav.c` file of the pspp software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow due to improper bounds checking when reading data.
- Specifically, the `fread` call within the `read_bytes_internal` function attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a crash due to memory corruption
- It is also possible to achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting adjacent heap metadata with carefully crafted input
- The provided ASan output shows a crash, confirming the vulnerability's impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted `.sav` file using `pspp-dump-sav`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide the target system with a malicious `.sav` file that will be processed by the `pspp-dump-sav` utility.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
- The provided ASan output clearly indicates a heap-buffer-overflow at `fread`, within `read_bytes_internal`.
- The fix implemented by the developers involves preventing the program from being installed, as a temporary solution, according to a comment in the bug report.
- There's a related CVE, CVE-2022-39832, which is a similar heap-based buffer overflow in `read_string`, also found through fuzzing, within the same `pspp-dump-sav.c` file.
- The vulnerability is different from CVE-2018-20230.
