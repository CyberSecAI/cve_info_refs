Why does multiple root elements not get caught by the XML parser (it's an XML parsing error?) prior to signature validation?

Sorry, something went wrong.

An XML parser will gladly parse an XML document with multiple roots. Then, a signature can apply to only one root node. However, XPath can traverse multiple root nodes to find authn and authz information. So, one root node may be signed and then another, unsigned node, could contain authn and authz information, which is obviously a problem.

The solution was chosen because there should never be more than one root node with children in a valid SAML XML document. So, limiting things this way makes all further processing much simpler and more secure.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[jindw/xmldom#150](https://github.com/jindw/xmldom/issues/150) (see the discussion about the fact that xmldom does not follow the standard, and instead allows multiple root nodes without either ignoring the malformed content after the first root node, or erroring). I see why you have chosen the solution you've chosen, but it's still broken at the XML parser level.

Some better solutions:

* Error on authentication response when an error status code is read (need to stop the parser at the point the status code is read, and then don't bother reading further and cancel the authentication)
* Parse the first root element only, and error when the second root element is received (don't read the second element at all), returning only the first valid root element, before validating the signature.
* Fail the assertion received since it cannot be signed by the attacker, if the SP has a key for the signer in metadata, and the response was signed.
* SAML assertion should never be a root element in an AuthnResponse (should only ever be inside of a samlp:Response).

[@frumioj](https://github.com/frumioj) , I'd love to see a PR with some of these solutions. You can either make the PR against the 3.x branch here, or over at node-saml, which will be what eventually powers a 4.x release here at passsport-saml.

## Description

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to passport-saml 3.2.2 or newer. The issue was also present in the beta releases of `node-saml` before v4.0.0-beta.5.

### Workarounds

Disable SAML authentication.
