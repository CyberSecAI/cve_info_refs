*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** The attacker can access sensitive browser-based information, including cookies and session tokens.
*    **Temporary Availability Impact:** In some cases, it can cause a temporary disruption to portions of the FMC Dashboard.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** A remote, authenticated attacker is required.
*   **Crafted Input:** An attacker can inject the malicious scripts into various data fields of the FMC's web-based management interface

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the Cisco FMC web-based management interface.
*   **Remote Position:** The attacker can conduct the attack remotely.

**7. Additional Information from the Content**
