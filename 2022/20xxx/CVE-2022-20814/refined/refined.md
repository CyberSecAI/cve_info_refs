  "source_texts": [
    "A vulnerability in the certificate validation of Cisco Expressway-C and Cisco TelePresence VCS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the SSL server certificate that an affected device receives when it establishes a connection to a Cisco Unified Communications Manager device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a man-in-the-middle technique to intercept the traffic between the devices, and then using a self-signed certificate to impersonate the endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the intercepted traffic in clear text or alter the contents of the traffic.",
