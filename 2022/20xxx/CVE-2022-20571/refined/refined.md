    "root cause": "A double free vulnerability exists in the dm-verity module of the Linux kernel.",

    "impact": "Elevation of privilege.",
    "attack vectors": "Exploitation of the double free during metadata extraction in the dm-verity module.",

       "required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to interact with the io_uring subsystem and invoke a deferred statx operation. This likely means local access and some level of privilege."
