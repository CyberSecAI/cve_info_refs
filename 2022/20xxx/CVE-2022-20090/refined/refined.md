- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing synchronization in the aee driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the device and trigger the race condition. No user interaction is required.
