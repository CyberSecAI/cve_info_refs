"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the Modbus preprocessor of the Snort detection engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an integer overflow while processing Modbus traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Modbus traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort process to hang, causing traffic inspection to stop.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"

"text": "This vulnerability affects all open source Snort project releases earlier than Release 2.9.19 and Release 3.1.11.0. For more information, see the Snort website [\"https://www.snort.org/\"].\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco software:\r\n\r\nCyber Vision Software\r\nFirePOWER Services Software - All platforms\r\nFirepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software - All platforms\r\nMeraki MX Series Software\r\n\r\nNote: For FTD Software, Modbus inspection is enabled by default for the Security Over Connectivity and Max Detect Network Analysis Policies (NAP). For Cyber Vision Software and Meraki MX Series Software, Modbus inspection is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release earlier than the first fixed release of Cisco Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Snort Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software or Cisco UTD Engine for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software:\r\n\r\n1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)\r\n4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)\r\nCatalyst 8000V Edge Software\r\nCatalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms\r\nCatalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms\r\nCatalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms\r\nCatalyst 8500L Series Edge Platforms\r\nCloud Services Routers 1000V\r\nIntegrated Services Virtual Routers (ISRv)\r\n\r\nNote: UTD is not installed on these devices by default.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determine Whether UTD is Enabled\r\nTo determine whether UTD is enabled on a device, issue the show utd engine standard status command and check for a Yes under Running. The following output shows a device with UTD enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show utd engine standard status\r\nEngine version : 1.0.19\_SV2.9.16.1\_XE17.3\r\nProfile : Cloud-Low\r\nSystem memory :\r\n Usage : 6.00 %\r\n Status : Green\r\nNumber of engines : 1\r\nEngine Running Health Reason\r\n===========================================\r\nEngine(#1): Yes Green None\r\n=======================================================\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nIf there is no output after issuing the command, the device is not affected."

"text": "For the Meraki MX series devices, exploitation of this vulnerability results in the bypass of inspection services. This could result in malicious traffic not generating alerts and in turn reaching devices that are located behind the MX series device. For this reason, the Security Impact Rating (SIR) for Meraki MX devices is Medium.\r\n\r\nFor Cyber Vision, exploitation of this vulnerability results in the bypass of Snort intrusion detection (IDS) services. This could result in malicious traffic not generating alerts. Deep packet inspection (DPI) and anomaly detection services are not impacted. For this reason, the SIR for Cyber Vision software is Medium."

"category": "general",
"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "While there are no workarounds that address this vulnerability, for FTD Software that is managed by Firepower Management Center (FMC) the Modbus preprocessor can be disabled to mitigate the attack vector for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo disable a preprocessor in an FTD NAP for a device running Snort 2, see Preprocessor Configuration in a Network Analysis Policy Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/getting\_started\_with\_network\_analysis\_policies.html#ID-2245-000001d4\"].\r\n\r\nTo disable an inspector in an FTD NAP for a device running Snort 3, see Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 3 [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/getting\_started\_with\_network\_analysis\_policies.html#Cisco\_Concept.dita\_a05cb5f4-3dc2-47f2-8aa1-b928ed67a410\_snort3\"].\r\n\r\nFor an FTD device managed by Firepower Device Manager (FDM), the device must be running Snort 3. For more information, see Configuring the Network Analysis Policy (Snort 3) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/710/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-710/fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#Cisco\_Task\_in\_List\_GUI.dita\_49189b70-682c-4336-9620-fe104df820f6\"].\r\n\r\nIf you need assistance implementing this mitigation, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/tac/\"].\r\n\r\nWhile this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment."

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

What is Snort?

Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules
that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and
generates alerts for users.

Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses:
As a packet sniffer like tcpdump, as a packet logger — which is useful for network traffic debugging, or it can be
used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. Snort can be downloaded and configured for personal
and business use alike.

What are my options for buying and using Snort?

Once downloaded and configured, Snort rules are distributed in two sets: The “Community Ruleset” and the “Snort Subscriber Ruleset.”

The Snort Subscriber Ruleset is developed, tested, and approved by Cisco Talos. Subscribers to the Snort Subscriber Ruleset will receive the
ruleset in real-time as they are released to Cisco customers. You can download the rules and deploy them in your network through the Snort.org website. The Community Ruleset is developed by the Snort community and QAed by Cisco Talos. It is freely available to all users.

For more information about Snort Subscriber Rulesets available for purchase, please visit the [Snort product page](/products).

## Upgrade Feature History

Table 6. Version 7.0.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Improved FTD upgrade performance and status reporting. | FTD upgrades are now easier faster, more reliable, and take up less disk space. A new Upgrades tab in the Message Center provides further enhancements to upgrade status and error reporting. |
| Easy-to-follow upgrade workflow for FTD devices. | A new device upgrade page (Devices > Device Upgrade) on the FMC provides an easy-to-follow wizard for upgrading Version 6.4+ FTD devices. It walks you through important pre-upgrade stages, including selecting devices to upgrade, copying the upgrade package to the devices, and compatibility and readiness checks.  To begin, use the new Upgrade Firepower Software action on the Device Management page (Devices > Device Management > Select Action).  As you proceed, the system displays basic information about your selected devices, as well as the current upgrade-related status. This includes any reasons why you cannot upgrade. If a device does not "pass" a stage in the wizard, it does not appear in the next stage.  If you navigate away from wizard, your progress is preserved, although other users with Administrator access can reset, modify, or continue the wizard.   | **Note** | You must still use System(system gear icon) > Updates to upload or specify the location of FTD upgrade packages. You must also use the System Updates page to upgrade the FMC itself, as well as all non-FTD managed devices. | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | In Version 7.0, the wizard does not correctly display devices in clusters or high availability pairs. Even though you must select and upgrade these devices as a unit, the wizard displays them as standalone devices. Device status and upgrade readiness are evaluated and reported on an individual basis. This means it is possible for one unit to appear to "pass" to the next stage while the other unit or units do not. However, these devices are still grouped. Running a readiness check on one, runs it on all. Starting the upgrade on one, starts it on all.  To avoid possible time-consuming upgrade failures, *manually* ensure all group members are ready to move on to the next step of the wizard before you click Next. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade more FTD devices at once. | The number of devices you can upgrade at once is now limited by your management network bandwidth—not the system's ability to manage simultaneous upgrades. Previously, we recommended against upgrading more than five devices at a time.   | **Important** | Only upgrades to FTD Version 6.7+ using the FTD upgrade wizard see this improvement. If you are upgrading devices to an older FTD release—even if you are using the new upgrade wizard—we still recommend you limit to five devices at a time. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade different device models together. | You can now use the FTD upgrade wizard to queue and invoke upgrades for all FTD models at the same time, as long as the system has access to the appropriate upgrade packages.  Previously, you would choose an upgrade package, then choose the devices to upgrade using that package. That meant that you could upgrade multiple devices at the same time *only* if they shared an upgrade package. For example, you could upgrade two Firepower 2100 series devices at the same time, but not a Firepower 2100 series and a Firepower 1000 series. |

Table 7. Version 6.7.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades remove PCAP files to save disk space. | Upgrades now remove locally stored PCAP files. To upgrade, you must have enough free disk space or the upgrade fails. |
| Improved FTD upgrade status reporting and cancel/retry options. | You can now view the status of FTD device upgrades and readiness checks in progress on the Device Management page, as well as a 7-day history of upgrade success/failures. The Message Center also provides enhanced status and error messages.  A new Upgrade Status pop-up, accessible from both Device Management and the Message Center with a single click, shows detailed upgrade information, including percentage/time remaining, specific upgrade stage, success/failure data, upgrade logs, and so on.  Also on this pop-up, you can manually cancel failed or in-progress upgrades (Cancel Upgrade), or retry failed upgrades (Retry Upgrade). Canceling an upgrade reverts the device to its pre-upgrade state.   | **Note** | To be able to manually cancel or retry a failed upgrade, you must disable the new auto-cancel option, which appears when you use the FMC to upgrade an FTD device: Automatically cancel on upgrade failure and roll back to the previous version. With the option enabled, the device automatically reverts to its pre-upgrade state upon upgrade failure.  Auto-cancel is not supported for patches. In an HA or clustered deployment, auto-cancel applies to each device individually. That is, if the upgrade fails on one device, only that device is reverted. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens:   * System(system gear icon) > Updates > Product Updates > Available Updates > Install icon for the FTD upgrade package * Devices > Device Management > Upgrade * Message Center > Tasks   New/modified CLI commands: show upgrade status detail , show upgrade status continuous , show upgrade status , upgrade cancel , upgrade retry |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Custom intrusion rule import warns when rules collide. | The FMC now warns you of rule collisions when you import custom (local) intrusion rules. Previously, the system would silently skip the rules that cause collisions—with the exception of Version 6.6.0.1, where a rule import with collisions would fail entirely.  On the Rule Updates page, if a rule import had collisions, a warning icon is displayed in the Status column. For more information, hover your pointer over the warning icon and read the tooltip.  Note that a collision occurs when you try to import an intrusion rule that has the same SID/revision number as an existing rule. You should always make sure that updated versions of custom rules have new revision numbers.  New/modified screens: We added a warning icon to System(system gear icon) > Updates > Rule Updates. |

Table 8. Version 6.6.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Get FTD upgrade packages from an internal web server. | FTD devices can now get upgrade packages from your own internal web server, rather than from the FMC. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth between the FMC and its devices. It also saves space on the FMC.   | **Note** | This feature is supported only for FTD devices running Version 6.6+. It is not supported for upgrades *to* Version 6.6, nor is it supported for the FMC or Classic devices. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens: We added a Specify software update source option to the page where you upload upgrade packages. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic VDB update during initial setup. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically attempts to update the vulnerability database (VDB).  This is a one-time operation. If the FMC has internet access, we recommend you schedule tasks to perform automatic recurring VDB update downloads and installations. |

Table 9. Version 6.5.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic software downloads and GeoDB updates. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically schedules:   * A weekly task to download software updates for the FMC   and its managed devices. * Weekly updates for the GeoDB.   The tasks are scheduled in UTC, which means that when they occur locally depends on the date and your specific location. Also, because tasks are scheduled in UTC, they do not adjust for Daylight Saving Time, summer time, or any such seasonal adjustments that you may observe in your location. If you are affected, scheduled tasks occur one hour “later” in the summer than in the winter, according to local time. We recommend you review the auto-scheduled configurations and adjust them if necessary. |

Table 10. Version 6.4.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Management Center Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades postpone scheduled tasks. | The FMC upgrade process now postpones scheduled tasks. Any task scheduled to begin during the upgrade will begin five minutes after the post-upgrade reboot.   | **Note** | Before you begin any upgrade, you must still make sure running tasks are complete. Tasks running when the upgrade begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed. | | --- | --- |   Note that this feature is supported for all upgrades *from* a supported version. This includes Version 6.4.0.10 and later patches, Version 6.6.3 and later maintenance releases, and Version 6.7.0+. This feature is not supported for upgrades *to* a supported version from an unsupported version. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Signed SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates. | So the system can verify that you are using the correct update files, Version 6.4+ uses *signed* updates for intrusion rules (SRU), the vulnerability database (VDB), and the geolocation database (GeoDB). Earlier versions continue to use unsigned updates.  Unless you manually download updates from the Cisco Support & Download site—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—you should not notice any difference in functionality. If, however, you do manually download and install SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates, make sure you download the correct package for your current version.  Signed update files begin with 'Cisco' instead of 'Sourcefire,' and terminate in .sh.REL.tar instead of .sh, as follows:   * SRU:   Cisco\_Firepower\_SRU-*date*-*build*-vrt.sh.REL.tar * VDB:   Cisco\_VDB\_Fingerprint\_Database-4.5.0-*version*.sh.REL.tar * GeoDB:   Cisco\_GEODB\_Update-*date*-*build*.sh.REL.tar   We will provide both signed and unsigned updates until the end-of-support for versions that require unsigned updates. Do not untar signed (.tar) packages. If you accidentally upload a signed update to an older FMC or ASA FirePOWER device, you must manually delete it. Leaving the package takes up disk space, and also may cause issues with future upgrades. |

Table 11. Version 6.2.3 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Device Upgrade** | |
| Copy upgrade packages to managed devices before the upgrade. | You can now copy (or push) an upgrade package from the FMC to a managed device before you run the actual upgrade. This is useful because you can push during times of low bandwidth use, outside of the upgrade maintenance window.  When you push to high availability, clustered, or stacked devices, the system sends the upgrade package to the active/control/primary first, then to the standby/data/secondary.  New/modified screens: System(system gear icon) > Updates |
| **Content Updates** | |
| FMC warns of Snort restart before VDB updates. | The FMC now warns you that Vulnerability Database (VDB) updates restart the Snort process. This interrupts traffic inspection and, depending on how the managed device handles traffic, possibly interrupts traffic flow. You can cancel the install until a more convenient time, such as during a maintenance window.  These warnings can appear:   * After you download and manually install a VDB. * When you create a scheduled task to install the VDB. * When the VDB installs in the background, such as during a   previously scheduled task or as part of a software   upgrade. |
| Deprecated: Geolocation details | In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package mapping IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package containing additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. In January 2024, we stopped providing the IP package. This saves disk space and does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way. Any contextual data is now stale, and upgrading to most later versions deletes the IP package. Options to view contextual data have no effect, and are removed in later versions. |

## Network Analysis Policy Basics

*Network analysis policies* govern many traffic preprocessing options, and are invoked by advanced settings in your access control policy. Network analysis-related
preprocessing occurs after Security Intelligence matching and SSL decryption, but before intrusion or file inspection begins.

By default, the system uses the
*Balanced Security and Connectivity* network analysis policy
to preprocess all traffic handled by an access control policy. However, you can
choose a different default network analysis policy to perform this
preprocessing. For your convenience, the system provides a choice of several
non-modifiable network analysis policies, which are tuned for a specific
balance of security and connectivity by the
Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos).
You can also create a custom network analysis policy with custom preprocessing
settings.

| **Tip** | ---   System-provided intrusion and network analysis policies are similarly named but contain different configurations. For example, the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis policy and the Balanced Security and Connectivity intrusion policy work together and can both be updated in intrusion rule updates. However, the network analysis policy governs mostly preprocessing options, whereas the intrusion policy governs mostly intrusion rules. Network analysis and intrusion policies work together to examine your traffic.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can also tailor traffic preprocessing options to specific
security zones, networks, and VLANs by creating multiple custom network
analysis policies, then assigning them to preprocess different traffic. (Note
that
ASA FirePOWER
cannot restrict preprocessing by VLAN.)

## License Requirements for Network Analysis Policies

## Managing Network Analysis Policies

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays policies created in the current domain, which you can edit. It also displays
policies created in ancestor domains, which you cannot edit. To view and edit policies created in a lower domain, switch to
that domain.

### Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 3

The default network analysis policy is tuned for typical network requirements and optimal performance. Usually, the default
network analysis policy suffices most network requirements and you might not need to customize the policy. However, when you
have a specific network requirement or when you are facing performance issues, the default network analysis policy can be
customized. Note that customizing the network analysis policy is an advanced configuration that should be done only by advanced
users or Cisco support.

Network analysis policy configuration for Snort 3 is a data-driven model, which is based on JSON and JSON Schema. Schema is
based on the OpenAPI specification, and it helps you get a view of the supported inspectors, settings, settings type, and
valid values. The Snort 3 inspectors are plugins that process packets (similar to the Snort 2 preprocessor). Network analysis
policy configuration is available to download in the JSON format.

In Snort 3, the list of inspectors and settings are not in a one-to-one mapping with the Snort 2 list of preprocessors and
settings. Also, the number of inspectors and settings available in FMC is a subset of the inspectors and settings that Snort 3 supports. See <https://snort.org/snort3> for more information on Snort 3. See <https://www.cisco.com/go/snort3-inspectors> for more information on the inspectors available in FMC.

| **Note** | ---  * While upgrading the FMC to the 7.0 release, the changes that were done in the Snort 2 version of the network analysis policy are not migrated to   Snort 3 after the upgrade. * Unlike the intrusion policy, there is no option to synchronize Snort 2 network analysis policy settings to Snort 3.  --- |

#### Default Inspector Updates

Lightweight Security Package (LSP) updates may contain new inspectors or modifications to integer ranges for existing inspector
configurations. Following the installation of an LSP, new inspectors and/or updated ranges will be available under Inspectors in the Snort 3 Version of your network analysis policy.

#### Binder Inspector

Binder inspector defines the flow when a particular inspector has to be accessed and taken into consideration. When the traffic
matches the conditions defined in the binder inspector, only then the values/configurations for that inspector come into effect.
For example:

For the *imap* inspector, the binder defines the following condition when it has to be accessed. That is when:

* Service is equal to imap.
* Role is equal to any.

If these conditions are met, then use the type imap.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/455001-456000/455524.jpg)

#### Singleton Inspectors

Singleton inspectors contain a single instance. These inspectors do not support adding more instances like multiton inspectors.
Settings of singleton inspector are applied to the entire traffic and not to a specific traffic segment.

For example:

```
{
   "normalizer":{
      "enabled":true,
      "type":"singleton",
      "data":{
         "ip4":{
            "df":true
         }
      }
   }
}
```

#### Multiton Inspectors

Multiton inspectors contain multiple instances which you can configure as needed. These inspectors support configuring settings
based on specific conditions, such as network, port, and VLAN. One set of supported settings is called an instance. There
is a default instance, and you can also add additional instances based on specific conditions. If the traffic matches that
condition, the settings from that instance are applied. Otherwise, the settings from the default instance are applied. Also,
the name of the default instance is the same as the inspector's name.

For a multiton inspector, when you upload the overridden inspector configuration, you also need to include/define a matching
binder condition (conditions under when the inspector has to be accessed or used) for each instance in the JSON file, otherwise,
the upload will result in an error. You can also create new instances, but make sure that you include a binder condition for
every new instance that you create to avoid errors.

For example:

* Multiton inspector where the default instance is modified.

  ```
  {
     "http_inspect":{
        "enabled":true,
        "type":"multiton",
        "instances":[
           {
              "name":"http_inspect",
              "data":{
                 "response_depth":5000
              }
           }
        ]
     }
  }
  ```
* Multiton inspector where the default instance and default binder is modified.

  ```
  {
     "http_inspect":{
        "enabled":true,
        "type":"multiton",
        "instances":[
           {
              "name":"http_inspect",
              "data":{
                 "response_depth":5000
              }
           }
        ]
     },
     "binder":{
        "type":"binder",
        "enabled":true,
        "rules":[
           {
              "use":{
                 "type":"http_inspect"
              },
              "when":{
                 "role":"any",
                 "ports":"8080",
                 "proto":"tcp",
                 "service":"http"
              }
           }
        ]
     }
  }
  ```
* Multiton inspector where a custom instance and a custom binder is added.

  ```
  {
     "http_inspect":{
        "enabled":true,
        "type":"multiton",
        "instances":[
           {
              "name":"http_inspect1",
              "data":{
                 "response_depth":5000
              }
           }
        ]
     },
     "binder":{
        "type":"binder",
        "enabled":true,
        "rules":[
           {
              "use":{
                 "type":"http_inspect",
                 "name":"http_inspect1"
              },
              "when":{
                 "role":"any",
                 "ports":"8080",
                 "proto":"tcp",
                 "service":"http"
              }
           }
        ]
     }
  }
  ```

#### Network Analysis Policy Mapping

For network analysis policies, Cisco Talos provides mapping information, which is used to find the corresponding Snort 2 version of the policies for the Snort 3 version.

This mapping ensures that the Snort 3 version of policies has its equivalent Snort 2 version.

#### View Network Analysis Policy Mapping

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Policies > Intrusion > Network Analysis Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click NAP Mapping. |
| **Step 3** | Expand the arrow for View Mappings.  The Snort 3 network analysis policies that are automatically mapped to a Snort 2 equivalent policy are displayed. |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

---

#### Create a Network Analysis Policy

All the existing network analysis policies are available in FMC with their corresponding Snort 2 and Snort 3 versions. When you create a new network analysis policy, it is created with
both the Snort 2 version and the Snort 3 version.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Policies > Intrusion > Network Analysis Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Create Policy. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the Name and Description. |
| **Step 4** | Choose the Inspection Mode from the available choices.   * Detection * Prevention |
| **Step 5** | Select a Base Policy and click Save.   | **Note** | Configure Network Analysis Policy (NAP) in Prevention mode if you are using Snort 3 and SSL Decryption or TLS Server Identity. | | --- | --- | |

---

The new network analysis policy is created with its corresponding Snort 2 Version and Snort 3 Version.

#### Modify the Network Analysis Policy

You can modify the network analysis policy to change its name, description, or the base policy.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Policies > Intrusion > Network Analysis Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Edit to change the name, description, inspection mode, or the base policy.   | **Note** | If you edit the network analysis policy name, description, base policy, and inspection mode, the edits are applied to both the Snort 2 and Snort 3 versions. If you want to change the inspection mode for a specific version, then you can do that from within the network analysis policy page for that respective version. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | Click Save. |

---

#### Customize the Network Analysis Policy

You can customize the Snort 3 version of the network analysis policy according to your requirements.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Policies > Intrusion > Network Analysis Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Go to the Snort 3 Version of the network analysis policy. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Actions drop-down menu.  The following options are displayed: |
| **Step 4** | Click View Schema to open the schema file directly in a browser. |
| **Step 5** | You can download the schema file, sample file / template, full configuration, or overridden configuration as needed.  These options provide you an insight about the allowed values, range, and patterns, existing and default inspector configurations, and overridden inspector configurations.   1. Click to download the schema file.  The schema file validates the content that you upload or download. You can download the schema file and open it using any    third-party JSON editor. The schema file helps you to identify what parameters can be configured for inspectors with their    corresponding allowed values, range, and accepted patterns to be used.  For example, for the *arp\_spoof\_snort* inspector, you can configure the hosts. The hosts include the *mac* and *ip* address values. The schema file shows the following accepted pattern for these values.     * mac – `pattern: ^([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}[:-]){5}([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})$`    * ip – `pattern: ^([0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}(/[0-9]{1,2}){0,1})$` You must provide the values, range, patterns according to the accepted ones in the schema file to be able to successfully    override the inspector configuration, otherwise, you get an error message. 2. Click to use a pre-existing template that contains example configurations to help you with configuring the inspectors.  You can refer to the example configurations included in the sample file and make any changes that you may require. 3. Click to download the entire inspector configurations in a single JSON file.  Instead of expanding the inspectors separately, you can download the full configuration to look out for the information you    need. All information regarding the inspector configuration is available in this file. 4. Click    to download the inspector configuration that has been overridden. |
| **Step 6** | To override the existing configuration, follow the steps.  You can choose to override an inspector configuration using the following ways.   * Make inline edits for an inspector directly on the FMC. See the topic **Make Inline Edit for an Inspector to Override Configuration** in the **Getting Started with Network Analysis Policies** chapter of the *Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide*. * Continue to follow the current procedure of using the Actions drop-down menu to upload the overridden configuration file.   If you chose to make inline edits directly in the FMC, then you don't need to follow the current procedure further. Otherwise, you must follow this procedure completely.   1. Under Inspectors, expand the required inspector for which you want to override the default configuration.  The default configuration is displayed on the left column and the overridden configuration is displayed on the right column    under the inspector.  You may need to search for an inspector by entering any relevant text in in the search bar. 2. Click the Copy to clipboard icon to copy the default inspector configuration to the clipboard. 3. Create a JSON file and paste the default configuration in it. 4. Keep the inspector configuration that you want to override, and remove all the other configuration and instances from the    JSON file.  You can also use the Sample File / Template to understand how to override the default configuration. This is a sample file that includes JSON snippets explaining how    you can customize the network analysis policy for Snort 3. 5. Make changes to the inspector configuration as needed.  Validate the changes and make sure they conform to the schema file. For multiton inspectors, make sure that the binder conditions    for all instances are included in the JSON file. See *Multiton Inspectors* in the topic **Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 3** in the *Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide* for more information. 6. If you are copying any further default inspector configurations, append that inspector configuration to the existing file    that contains the overridden configuration.         | **Note** | The copied inspector configuration must comply with the JSON standards. |    | --- | --- | 7. Save the overridden configuration file to your system. |
| **Step 7** | to upload the JSON file that contains the overridden configuration.   | **Caution** | Upload only the changes that you require. You should not upload the entire configuration as it makes the overrides sticky in nature and therefore, any subsequent changes to the default configuration as part of the LSP updates would not be applied. | | --- | --- |   You can drag and drop a file or click to browse to the JSON file saved in your system that contains the overridden inspector configuration.   * Merge inspector overrides – Content in the uploaded file is merged with the existing configuration if there is no common inspector. If there are common   inspectors, then the content in the uploaded file (for common inspectors) takes precedence over the previous content, and   it replaces the previous configuration for those inspectors. * Replace inspector overrides – Removes all previous overrides and replaces them with the new content in the uploaded file.      | **Attention** | Choosing this option deletes all the previous overrides. Make an informed decision before you override the configuration using this option. |   | --- | --- |   If any error occurs while uploading the overridden inspectors, you see the error in the Upload Overridden Configuration File pop-up window. You can also download the file with the error, fix the error, and reupload the file. |
| **Step 8** | In the Upload Overridden Configuration File pop-up window, click Import to upload the overridden inspector configuration.  After you upload the overridden inspector configuration, you will see an orange icon next to the inspector that signifies that it is an overridden inspector.  Also, the Overridden Configuration column under the inspector shows the overridden value.  You can also view all the overridden inspectors using the Show Overrides Only checkbox adjacent to the Search bar.   | **Note** | Make sure that you always download the overridden configuration, open the JSON file, and append any new changes/overrides to the inspector configurations to this file. This action is needed so that you do not lose the old overridden configurations. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 9** | (Optional) Take a backup of the overridden configuration file on your system before making any new inspector configuration changes.   | **Tip** | We recommend that you take the backup from time to time as you override the inspector configuration. | | --- | --- | |

### Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 2

When you create a new network analysis policy you must give it a
unique name, specify a base policy, and choose an
*inline mode*.

The base policy defines the network analysis policy’s default
settings. Modifying a setting in the new policy overrides—but does not
change—the settings in the base policy. You can use either a system-provided or
custom policy as your base policy.

The network analysis policy’s inline mode allows preprocessors
to modify (normalize) and drop traffic to minimize the chances of attackers
evading detection. Note that in passive deployments, the system cannot affect
traffic flow regardless of the inline mode.

#### Creating a Custom Network Analysis Policy

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays policies created in the current domain, which you can edit. It also displays
policies created in ancestor domains, which you cannot edit. To view and edit policies created in a lower domain, switch to
that domain.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies.   | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Create Policy. If you have unsaved changes in another policy, click Cancel when prompted to return to the **Network Analysis Policy** page. |
| **Step 3** | Enter a unique Name.  In a multidomain deployment, policy names must be unique within the domain hierarchy. The system may identify a conflict with the name of a policy you cannot view in your current domain. |
| **Step 4** | Optionally, enter a Description. |
| **Step 5** | Choose the initial Base Policy. You can use either a system-provided or custom policy as your base policy. |
| **Step 6** | If you want to allow preprocessors to affect traffic in an inline deployment, enable Inline Mode. |
| **Step 7** | To create the policy:   * Click Create Policy to create the new policy and return to the **Network Analysis Policy** page. The new policy has the same settings as its base policy. * Click Create and Edit Policy to create the policy and open it for editing in the advanced network analysis policy editor. |

### Network Analysis Policy Management for Snort 2

On the Network Analysis Policy page (or Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies), you can view your current custom network analysis policies, along with the following information:

* the time and date the policy was last modified (in local time)
  and the user who modified it
* whether the
  Inline Mode setting is enabled, which allows
  preprocessors to affect traffic
* which access control policies and devices are using the network
  analysis policy to preprocess traffic
* whether a policy has unsaved changes, as well as information
  about who (if anyone) is currently editing the policy

In addition to custom policies that you create, the system
provides two custom policies: Initial Inline Policy and Initial Passive Policy.
These two network analysis policies use the Balanced Security and Connectivity
network analysis policy as their base. The only difference between them is
their inline mode, which allows preprocessors to affect traffic in the inline
policy and disables it in the passive policy. You can edit and use these
system-provided custom policies.

Note that you can create and edit network analysis as well as
intrusion policies if your Firepower System user account’s role is restricted
to Intrusion Policy or Modify Intrusion Policy.

#### Network Analysis Policy Settings and Cached Changes

When you create a new network analysis policy, it has the same
settings as its base policy.

When tailoring a network analysis policy, especially when
disabling preprocessors, keep in mind that some preprocessors and intrusion
rules require that traffic first be decoded or preprocessed in a certain way.
If you disable a required preprocessor, the system automatically uses it with
its current settings, although the preprocessor remains disabled in the network
analysis policy web interface.

| **Note** | ---   Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related, the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet **must** complement each other. Tailoring preprocessing, especially using multiple custom network analysis policies, is an **advanced** task.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The system caches one network analysis policy per user. While
editing a network analysis policy, if you select any menu or other path to
another page, your changes stay in the system cache even if you leave the page.

#### Editing Network Analysis Policies

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays policies created in the current domain, which you can edit. It also displays
policies created in ancestor domains, which you cannot edit. To view and edit policies created in a lower domain, switch to
that domain.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies.   | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Edit (edit icon) next to the network analysis policy you want to configure.  If View (View button) appears instead, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. |
| **Step 3** | Edit your network analysis policy:   * Change the base policy — If you want to change the base policy, choose a base policy from the Base Policy drop-down list on the Policy Information page. * Manage policy layers — If you want to manage policy layers, click Policy Layers in the navigation panel. * Modify a preprocessor — If you want to enable, disable, or edit the settings for a preprocessor, click Settings in the navigation panel. * Modify traffic — If you want to allow preprocessors to modify or drop traffic, check the  Inline Mode check box on the Policy Information page. * View settings — If you want to view the settings in the base policy, click Manage Base Policy on the Policy Information page. |
| **Step 4** | To save changes you made in this policy since the last policy commit, choose Policy Information, then click Commit Changes. If you leave the policy without committing changes, changes since the last commit are discarded if you edit a different policy. |

---

##### What to do next

* If you want a preprocessor to generate events and, in an inline deployment, drop offending packets, enable rules for the preprocessor. For more information, see [Setting Intrusion Rule States](tuning_intrusion_policies_using_rules.html#ID-2237-00000683).
* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](policy_management.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

### Preprocessor Configuration in a Network Analysis Policy for Snort 2

*Preprocessors* prepare traffic to be further inspected by
normalizing traffic and identifying protocol anomalies. Preprocessors can
generate preprocessor events when packets trigger preprocessor options that you
configure. The base policy for your network analysis policy determines which
preprocessors are enabled by default and the default configuration for each.

| **Note** | ---   In most cases, preprocessors require specific expertise to configure and typically require little or no modification. Tailoring preprocessing, especially using multiple custom network analysis policies, is an **advanced** task. Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related, the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet **must** complement each other.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Modifying a preprocessor configuration requires an understanding
of the configuration and its potential impact on your network.

Note that some advanced transport and network preprocessor
settings apply globally to all networks, zones, and VLANs where you deploy your
access control policy. You configure these advanced settings in an access
control policy rather than in a network analysis policy.

Note also that you configure the sensitive data preprocessor,
which detects sensitive data such as credit card numbers and Social Security
numbers in ASCII text, in intrusion policies.

#### Preprocessor Traffic Modification in Inline Deployments

In an inline deployment (that is, where relevant configurations
are deployed to devices using routed, switched, or transparent interfaces, or
inline interface pairs), some preprocessors can modify and block traffic. For
example:

* The inline normalization preprocessor normalizes packets to
  prepare them for analysis by other preprocessors and the intrusion rules
  engine. You can also use the preprocessor’s
  Allow These TCP Options and
  Block Unresolvable TCP Header Anomalies options to
  block certain packets.
* The system can drop packets with invalid checksums.
* The system can drop packets matching rate-based attack
  prevention settings.

For a preprocessor configured in the network analysis policy to
affect traffic, you must enable and correctly configure the preprocessor, as
well as correctly deploy managed devices inline. Finally, you must enable the
network analysis policy’s
Inline Mode setting.

#### Preprocessor Configuration in a Network Analysis Policy Notes

When you select
Settings in the navigation panel of a network
analysis policy, the policy lists its preprocessors by type. On the Settings
page, you can enable or disable preprocessors in your network analysis policy,
as well as access preprocessor configuration pages.

A preprocessor must be enabled for you to configure it. When you
enable a preprocessor, a sublink to the configuration page for the preprocessor
appears beneath the
Settings link in the navigation panel, and an
Edit link to the configuration page appears next to
the preprocessor on the Settings page.

| **Tip** | ---   To revert a preprocessor’s configuration to the settings in the base policy, click Revert to Defaults on a preprocessor configuration page. When prompted, confirm that you want to revert.   --- |
| --- | --- |

When you disable a preprocessor, the sublink and
Edit link no longer appear, but your configurations
are retained. Note that to perform their particular analysis, many
preprocessors and intrusion rules require that traffic first be decoded or
preprocessed in a certain way. If you disable a required preprocessor, the
system automatically uses it with its current settings, although the
preprocessor remains disabled in the network analysis policy web interface.

If you want to assess how your configuration would function in
an inline deployment without actually modifying traffic, you can disable inline
mode. In passive deployments or inline deployments in tap mode, the system
cannot affect traffic regardless of the inline mode setting.

| **Note** | ---   Disabling inline mode can affect intrusion event performance statistics graphs. With inline mode enabled in an inline deployment, the Intrusion Event Performance page (Overview > Summary > Intrusion Event Performance) displays graphs that represent normalized and blocked packets. If you disable inline mode, or in a passive deployment, many of the graphs display data about the traffic the system would have normalized or dropped.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   In an inline deployment, Cisco recommends that you enable inline mode and configure the inline normalization preprocessor with the Normalize TCP Payload option enabled. In a passive deployment, Cisco recommends that you use adaptive profile updates.   --- |

# Intrusion Policies

The following topics explain intrusion policies and the closely
associated network analysis policies (NAP). Intrusion policies include rules
that check traffic for threats and block traffic that appears to be an attack.
Network analysis policies control traffic preprocessing, which prepares traffic
to be further inspected by normalizing traffic and identifying protocol
anomalies.

Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related,
the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet must
complement each other.

## About Intrusion and Network Analysis Policies

Network analysis and intrusion policies work together to detect and
prevent intrusion threats.

* A network analysis policy (NAP) governs how traffic is decoded and
  preprocessed so that it can be further evaluated, especially for anomalous
  traffic that might signal an intrusion attempt.
* An intrusion policy uses intrusion and preprocessor rules, which are
  collectively known as intrusion rules, to examine the decoded packets for
  attacks based on patterns. The rules can either prevent (drop) the threatening
  traffic and generate an event, or simply detect (alert) it and generate an
  event only.

As the system analyzes traffic, the network analysis decoding and
preprocessing phase occurs before and separately from the intrusion prevention
phase. Together, network analysis and intrusion policies provide broad and deep
packet inspection. They can help you detect, alert on, and protect against
network traffic that could threaten the availability, integrity, and
confidentiality of hosts and their data.

### System-Defined Network Analysis and Intrusion Policies

The system includes several pairs of same-named network analysis and intrusion policies that complement and work with each
other. For example there are both NAP and intrusion policies named “Balanced Security and Connectivity,” which are meant to
be used together. The system-provided policies are configured by the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos). For these policies, Talos sets the intrusion and preprocessor rule states and provides the initial configurations for preprocessors and other advanced
settings.

As new vulnerabilities become known, Talos releases intrusion rule updates. These rule updates can modify any system-provided network analysis or intrusion policy,
and can provide new and updated intrusion rules and preprocessor rules, modified states for existing rules, and modified default
policy settings. Rule updates might also delete rules from system-provided policies and provide new rule categories, as well
as modify the default variable set.

You can manually update the rules database, or configure a regular
update schedule. You must deploy an update for it to take effect. For more
information on updating system databases, see
[Updating System Databases](fptd-fdm-mgmt.html#id_11511).

The following are the system-provided policies:

Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis and intrusion
policies

These policies are built for both speed and detection. Used
together, they serve as a good starting point for most networks and deployment
types. The system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis
policy as the default.

Connectivity Over Security network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where connectivity, the
ability to get to all resources, takes precedence over network infrastructure
security. The intrusion policy enables far fewer rules than those enabled in
the Security over Connectivity policy. Only the most critical rules that block
traffic are enabled.

Security Over Connectivity network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where network infrastructure
security takes precedence over user convenience. The intrusion policy enables
numerous network anomaly intrusion rules that could alert on or drop legitimate
traffic.

Maximum Detection network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where network infrastructure
security is given even more emphasis than is given by the Security Over
Connectivity policies, with the potential for even greater operational impact.
For example, the intrusion policy enables rules in a large number of threat
categories including malware, exploit kit, old and common vulnerabilities, and
known in-the-wild exploits.

### Inspection Mode: Prevention vs. Detection

By default, all intrusion policies operate in Prevention mode to implement an Intrusion
Prevention System (IPS). In the Prevention inspection mode, if a connection matches an
intrusion rule whose action is to drop traffic, the connection is actively blocked.

If you instead want to test the effect of the intrusion policy on your network, you can
change the mode to Detection, which implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In
this inspection mode, drop rules are treated like alert rules, where you are notified of
matching connections, but the action result becomes Would Have Blocked, and connections
are never in fact blocked.

You change the inspection mode per intrusion policy, so you can have a mix of prevention
and detection.

The Snort 3 network analysis policy (NAP) also has an
inspection mode. Unlike the intrusion policy, the NAP policy is global, so you must run
all NAP processing in either Prevention or Detection mode. You should use the same mode
you use for your intrusion policies. If you have a mix of Prevention and Detection
policies, select Prevention to match your most restrictive intrusion policies.

### Intrusion and Preprocessor Rules

An intrusion rule is a specified set of keywords and arguments that the
system uses to detect attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in your network. As
the system analyzes network traffic, it compares packets against the conditions
specified in each rule, and triggers the rule if the data packet meets all the
conditions specified in the rule.

The system includes the following types of rules created by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos):

* Intrusion rules, which are subdivided into shared object rules and
  standard text rules
* Preprocessor rules, which are rules associated with preprocessors
  and packet decoder detection options in the network analysis policy. Most
  preprocessor rules are disabled by default.

The following topics explain intrusion rules in more depth.

* [Intrusion Rule Attributes](#concept_C4C21B1BDF794F468738C9F836C6C87B)
* [Default Intrusion Variable Set](#concept_AF54E757E6694EE4B08030A4EA1D737C)
* [Generator Identifiers](#concept_821B9C87DA8744CB8E3C2375A1DB3C9B)

#### Intrusion Rule Attributes

When you view an intrusion policy, you see a list of all the intrusion rules available for
identifying threats.

The list of rules for each policy is the same. The difference is in the action configured for each rule. Because there are
over 30,000 rules, scrolling through the list will take time. Rules are revealed as you scroll through the list.

Following are the
attributes that define each rule:

> (Signature
Description)

Click the > button in the left column to open the signature description. The description is the actual code used by the Snort inspection
engine to match traffic against the rule. Explaining the code is out of scope for this document, but it is explained in detail
in Management Center Configuration Guide; select the book for your software version from <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html>. Look for information on intrusion rule editing.

The signatures
contain variables for certain items. For more information, see
[Default Intrusion Variable Set](#concept_AF54E757E6694EE4B08030A4EA1D737C).

GID

Generator Identifier (ID). This number indicates which system component evaluates the rule
and generates events. A 1 indicates a standard text intrusion rule, a 3
indicates a shared object intrusion rule. (The difference in these rule
types is not meaningful for a FDM user.) These are the main rules of interest when configuring an intrusion
policy. For information on the other GIDs, see [Generator Identifiers](#concept_821B9C87DA8744CB8E3C2375A1DB3C9B).

SID

Snort Identifier (ID), also called signature ID. Snort IDs lower than 1000000 were created by the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos).

Action

The state of
this rule in the selected intrusion policy. For each rule, “(Default)” is added
to the action that is the default action for the rule within this policy. To
return a rule to its default setting, you select this action. Possible actions
are:

* Alert—Create an
  event when this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the connection.
* Drop—Create an
  event when this rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection.
* Disabled—Do not
  match traffic against this rule. No events are generated.

Status

For Snort 2 rules, Status is a separate column. If you change the default
action for a rule, this column shows “Overridden.” Otherwise, the column is
empty.

For Snort 3 rules, the “Overridden” status is shown at the bottom of the
Action attribute, if you changed it.

Message

This is the name
of the rule, which also appears in events triggered by the rule. The message
typically identifies the threat that the signature matches. You can search the
Internet for more information on each threat.

#### Default Intrusion Variable Set

The intrusion rule
signatures contain variables for certain items. Following are the default
values for the variables, with $HOME\_NET and $EXTERNAL\_NET being the most
commonly used variables. Note that the protocol is specified separately from
port numbers, so port variables are numbers only.

* $DNS\_SERVERS =
  $HOME\_NET (meaning any IP address).
* $EXTERNAL\_NET =
  any IP address.
* $FILE\_DATA\_PORTS =
  $HTTP\_PORTS, 143, 110.

  $HOME\_NET (meaning any IP address).
* $TELNET\_SERVERS =
  $HOME\_NET (meaning any IP address).

#### Generator Identifiers

The generator identifier (GID) identifies the subsystem that
evaluates an intrusion rule and generates events. Standard text intrusion rules
have a generator ID of 1, and shared
object intrusion rules have a generator ID of 3. There are also several sets of
rules for various preprocessors. The following table explains the GIDs.

Table 1. Generator IDs

| ID | Component |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Standard Text Rule. |
| 2 | Tagged Packets.  (Rules for the Tag generator, which generates packets from a tagged session. ) |
| 3 | Shared Object Rule. |
| 102 | HTTP Decoder. |
| 105 | Back Orifice Detector. |
| 106 | RPC Decoder. |
| 116 | Packet Decoder. |
| 119, 120 | HTTP Inspect Preprocessor.  (GID 120 rules relate to server-specific HTTP traffic.) |
| 122 | Portscan Detector. |
| 123 | IP Defragmentor. |
| 124 | SMTP Decoder.  (Exploits against SMTP verbs.) |
| 125 | FTP Decoder. |
| 126 | Telnet Decoder. |
| 128 | SSH Preprocessor. |
| 129 | Stream Preprocessor. |
| 131 | DNS Preprocessor. |
| 133 | DCE/RPC Preprocessor. |
| 134 | Rule Latency, Packet Latency.  (Events for these rules are generated when rule latency suspends (SID 1) or re-enables (SID 2) a group of intrusion rules, or when the system stops inspecting a packet because the packet latency threshold is exceeded (SID 3).) |
| 135 | Rate-Based Attack Detector.  (Excessive connections to hosts on the network.) |
| 137 | SSL Preprocessor. |
| 138, 139 | Sensitive Data Preprocessor. |
| 140 | SIP Preprocessor. |
| 141 | IMAP Preprocessor. |
| 142 | POP Preprocessor. |
| 143 | GTP Preprocessor. |
| 144 | Modbus Preprocessor. |
| 145 | DNP3 Preprocessor. |

### Network Analysis Policies

Network analysis policies control traffic preprocessing. Preprocessors prepare traffic to be
further inspected by normalizing traffic and identifying protocol anomalies. Network
analysis-related preprocessing occurs after Security Intelligence drops and SSL
decryption, but before access control and intrusion or file inspection.

By default, the system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis
policy to preprocess all traffic handled by the access control policy. However, if
you configure an intrusion policy on any access control rule, the system uses the
network analysis policy that matches the most aggressive intrusion policy applied.
For example, if you use both Security over Connectivity and Balanced policies in
your access control rules, the system uses the Security over Connectivity NAP for
all traffic. For Snort 3 custom intrusion
policies, this assignment is done according to the base template policy assigned
to the intrusion policy.

When using Snort 3, you can select a policy explicitly and optionally customize its
settings. We recommend that you select the policy whose name matches the intrusion
policy that you use for most traffic that goes through the device, whether you use
the intrusion policy directly, or you use it as the base policy in your custom
intrusion policies. You can then change the inspection mode, or adjust specific
inspector or binder settings to account for the traffic on your network.

In addition, consider whether you have enabled preprocessor rules in the intrusion
policy. If you enable rules that require a preprocessor, ensure that you also enable
the corresponding inspector in the NAP. For each inspector, you can also adjust the
attributes for the inspector, including the ports examined (the binders), to
customize inspector behavior for your network.

| **Note** | ---   If you are using Snort 2, the system uses the same-named NAP policy as the most restrictive intrusion policy you apply in any access control rule, and you cannot edit inspector or binder settings.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## License Requirements for Intrusion Policies

You must enable the **Threat** license to apply intrusion policies in access control rules. For information on configuring licenses, see [Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

No extra license is needed for network analysis policies.

## Applying Intrusion Policies in Access Control Rules

To apply intrusion
policies to network traffic, you select the policy within an access control
rule that allows traffic. You do not directly assign intrusion policies.

You can assign
different intrusion policies to provide variable intrusion protection based on
the relative risks of the networks you are protecting. For example, you might
use the more stringent Security over Connectivity policy for traffic between
your inside network and external networks. On the other hand, you might apply
the more lenient Connectivity over Security policy for traffic between inside
networks.

You can also
simplify your configuration by using the same policy for all networks. For
example, the Balanced Security and Connectivity policy is design to provide
good protection without excessively impacting connectivity.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Either create a new rule, or edit an existing rule, that allows traffic.  If the default action is allow, you can also specify an intrusion policy in the default action.  You cannot apply intrusion policies to rules that trust or block traffic. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Intrusion Policy tab. |
| **Step 4** | Select Intrusion Policy > On and select the intrusion inspection policy to use on matching traffic. |

## Switching Between Snort 2 and Snort 3

Snort is the main inspection engine for the product. Although you can switch Snort
versions freely, some intrusion rules in Snort 2.0 might not exist in Snort 3.0, and
vice versa. If you changed the rule action for one of these rules, that change is
not preserved if you switch to Snort 3 and then back to Snort 2, or back again to
Snort 3. Your changes to rule actions for rules that exist in both versions are
preserved. Note that the mapping between rules in Snort 3 vs. Snort 2 can be
one-to-one or one-to-many, so preservation of changes is done on a best effort
basis.

If you change the Snort version, the system will perform an automatic deployment to implement the change. You can see the
progress in the Task list. The tasks are Snort Version Change and Automatic Deployment—Snort version toggle. Because of the
deployment and the fact that Snort must be stopped and restarted, all existing connections, including VPN, are dropped and
must be reestablished, which will cause a momentary traffic loss.

| **Note** | ---   If you try to switch Snort versions and the switch fails, you will have pending changes that you cannot discard, and a subsequent toggle attempt will not be allowed. If this happens, you must complete the switch using the ToggleInspectionEngine API, which you can use from the API Explorer. You must set the bypassPendingChangeValidation attribute to TRUE.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

To determine which Snort version is currently enabled, use this procedure, or choose Policies > Intrusion. Look for the Snort Version line above the
table. The current version is the first number in the complete version number. For
example, 2.9.17-95 is a Snort 2 version.

If the device is in an air-gapped network, consider manually uploading the latest
rules package for the new version before switching.

If you downgrade to 2.0, any custom intrusion policies that you created are converted
to the base policy used in the custom policy. As far as possible, rule action
overrides are retained. If more than one custom policy uses the same base policy,
the overrides of the custom policy that is used in the most access control policies
are retained, and the overrides for the other custom policies are lost. Access
control rules that used these "duplicate" policies will now use the base policy
created from your most-used custom policy. All custom policies are deleted. If you
want to preserve the custom policies so that you can import them later, after
switching back to Snort 3, use the FTD API to export the configuration.

In addition, a downgrade to 2.0 removes any NAP
customizations, and the system switches to use the most appropriate NAP based on the
intrusion policies used in access control rules.

Hostname redirect in active authentication also
requires Snort 3, and will be removed if you switch to Snort 2.

You must deploy any pending changes before you can switch Snort versions.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Device, then click View Configuration in the Updates summary.  Look at the Intrusion Rule group. The current Snort version is indicated. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Intrusion Rule group, you can change the Snort version by clicking Upgrade to Snort 3.0 or Downgrade to Snort 2.0. |
| **Step 3** | When prompted to confirm your action, select the option to get the latest intrusion rules package, then click Yes.  We recommend that you get the latest rules package. The system downloads packages for the active Snort version only, so it is unlikely that you have the latest package installed for the Snort version you are switching to.  You must wait until the task to switch versions completes before you can edit intrusion policies. |

## Configuring Syslog for Intrusion Events

You can configure an external syslog server for intrusion policies to
send intrusion events to your syslog server. You must configure the syslog
server on the intrusion policy to get intrusion events sent to the server.
Configuring a syslog server on an access rule sends connection events only to
the syslog server, not intrusion events.

If you select multiple syslog servers, events are
sent to each of the servers.

Intrusion events have the message ID 430001.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button.) to configure syslog. |
| **Step 3** | Click the + button under Send Intrusion Events To and select the server objects that define the syslog servers. If the required objects do not already exist, click Create New Syslog Server and create them. |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

---

## Configuring the Network Analysis Policy (Snort 3)

The Network Analysis Policy (NAP) is applied to all allowed connections on the
device. The NAP determines which inspectors are enabled, and the values of the
attributes used by the inspectors. The binders determine the ports and protocols
that should be associated with the various inspectors.

Coordinate the NAP with the intrusion policies you apply in access control rules:

* If you use a single intrusion policy in your access control rules, select the
  same-named NAP. Then, make adjustments to inspectors and attributes based on
  the settings in your intrusion policy. For example, if you enable intrusion
  rules for a particular inspector, such as CIP, ensure that you enable that
  inspector in the NAP.
* If you use multiple intrusion policies, select the NAP that matches the most
  strict intrusion policy that you use.
* If you use custom intrusion policies, make your NAP selection based on the
  base intrusion policy for your custom intrusion policies.
* If you do not need to customize any inspectors or binders, consider
  configuring the system to automatically select the most appropriate NAP
  based on your intrusion policy usage. This is the default option.

### Before you begin

Unless you prevent it, the system regularly downloads LSP updates to the inspection
rules. These updates can add or remove inspectors and attributes, and change default
settings for attributes. If you have made overrides to removed inspectors, these
overrides are preserved and you will see warnings that the inspector is no longer
supported. In this case, delete the inspector and make any other flagged adjustments
to ensure your NAP is completely valid.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion.  Verify that the Snort version shown above the table is 3.x. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button.). |
| **Step 3** | In Default Network Analysis Policy, select one of the following:   * Auto—Automatically select the NAP that matches   the most-used intrusion policy (or base policy for custom rules)   applied in access control rules. If you do not apply any intrusion   policies, the Balanced Security and Connectivity NAP is used. The   NAP is run in Prevention mode, and you cannot customize intrusion or   binder settings. The remainder of this procedure does not apply when   running in automatic mode. * Custom—Explicitly select the NAP that should   be used. Click the Edit link next to the   policy name to select a different policy. You can then select the   inspection mode, and customize inspector and binder settings, as   described in the following steps. |
| **Step 4** | In the Edit Network Analysis Policy dialog box, select the policy and configure its settings.   1. In Network Analysis Policy, select the policy    that should apply globally to all allowed connections. 2. Select the Inspection Mode.  The inspection mode determines how non-compliant traffic is handled.    Use the same inspection mode as you use in your intrusion policies    for optimal results.     * Prevention—Block any decoder,      normalization, or protocol anomalies based on the settings      in the policy. You must use this option if you enable the      SSL Decryption policy, or if you enable the TLS      Server Identity Discovery option in the      access control policy settings.    * Detection—Simply issue alerts for      decoder, normalization, or protocol anomalies. Do not block      any traffic. 3. (Optional.) Configure and manage overrides to the inspectors and    binders:     * To edit overrides, see [Configuring Inspector and Binder Overrides](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_e6960060-5b51-419d-ac09-fb55545850b3).    * To download the schema or overrides, see [Downloading Overrides and the Schema](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_6d5ef939-3834-4b06-acdf-dff2d647758c).    * To upload overrides, see [Uploading Overrides](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_e447172f-a47e-4032-8776-549b10eb8c6a).    * To reset all the overrides, click the Reset      Inspector/Binder Overrides link above the      NAP file. You are asked to confirm the reset. The deletion      is limited to inspectors or binders, as indicated in the      command name. For example, deleting all binder overrides      leaves your inspector overrides unchanged.    * To reverse all changes to the selected inspector, click      Reset Inspector to      Defaults.    * To filter the view so you see only those inspectors that have      overrides, click Show Only Overrides.      Click Show All Inspectors to remove      the filter. 4. Click OK. |

### Configuring Inspector and Binder Overrides

When you select a base NAP, you are selecting inspector settings contained in that
baseline policy. In most cases, these are the appropriate settings.

However, you can override the settings in the selected NAP. For example, you can
enable or disable individual inspectors, or change the value for an attribute or a
binder.

The following procedure explains how to configure overrides directly. Alternatively,
you can download the schema, make changes offline, then upload your overrides. You
can also upload the overrides you downloaded from another device.

#### Before you begin

Explaining each inspector, binder, and attribute is beyond the scope of this
document. For detailed information, including examples, see Snort 3 Inspector
Reference at <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/snort3-inspectors/snort-3-inspector-reference.html>.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion, click the  Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button. ), select Custom for the NAP settings, then click the Edit link next to the policy name. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab that contains the setting you want to change:   * Inspectors—The inspectors examine specific   types of traffic, such as FTP, for protocol anomalies. * Binders—The Binder inspector determines when a   service inspector needs to be used to inspect traffic. The   configurations in the binder inspector include the ports, hosts,   CIDRs, and services that define when another inspector in the   network analysis policy needs to inspect traffic. |
| **Step 3** | Edit the settings as needed.   * Use the following to control the view in the JSON editor:    + Use the Filter edit box to do a     full-text search of the JSON file.   + Click the Expand All Fields button     (Expand all fields) to open all of the folders in the JSON file.   + Click the Collapse All Fields (Collapse all fields) button to close all folders in the JSON file.   + Click the Undo Last Action (Undo last action) button to reverse your most recent change.   + Click the Redo (Redo) button to redo your last reversed change.   + Select Tree to see a formatted view of     the JSON file, which includes action menus, error flags, and     other features to guide your edits.   + Select Code to see the raw JSON file. * In Tree view, click the Menu (JSON menu) button to manipulate the contents of the file. You can:    + Insert attributes. Use Auto to have     the editor determine the appropriate data type. Otherwise,     add an Array, Object, or String. If you add an invalid     attribute, the system will mark the inspector or binder as     having a problem that you must resolve.   + Append attributes. This action does     the same as Insert, but puts the attribute at the end of the     section.   + Duplicate the selected attribute.   + Remove (delete) the selected     attribute. When editing an attribute, a popup message might     also provide a Delete command. * To enable an inspector that is currently disabled, or change the   setting of any Boolean attribute, click the checkbox in front of the   attribute value. For example, to enable an inspector, change the   enabled : false attribute to:    Enabled set to true. * To change the value of a string or numeric attribute, click in the   attribute and edit the value as needed. If your entry violates the   rules for the field, error messages explain the discrepancy. For   example, a numeric value indicates the valid range of values if you   enter a value outside the range. * To reset overrides:    + Click Reset Inspector/Binder Overrides     to remove all of your changes to all inspectors or binders     and return to default values. The deletion is limited to     inspectors or binders, as indicated in the command name. For     example, deleting all binder overrides leaves your inspector     overrides unchanged.   + Click Reset Inspector to     Defaults to reverse all changes to the     selected inspector only. * To filter the view so you see only those inspectors that have   overrides, click Show Only Overrides. Click   Show All Inspectors to remove the filter. * If an inspector is no longer supported, the inspector is flagged with   a message. Click the Delete Inspector link in   the message to remove the inspector. |
| **Step 4** | Click OK when finished. |

---

### Downloading Overrides and the Schema

You can download the NAP schema, or download the overrides you have configured for
the policy.

Downloading overrides is recommended whenever you change the base NAP, in case you
want to go back to your previous settings. In addition, you could use the JSON
editor on one device to implement the overrides you want to use on all devices,
download the overrides, then upload that override file to other devices.

Downloading the schema is useful if you want to edit the file offline, then upload
your overrides to this device or to multiple devices. You should copy/paste just the
sections you need to change, rather than upload the entire file, to ensure only
those changes you make are considered overrides.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion, click the  Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button. ), select Custom for the NAP settings, then click the Edit link next to the policy name. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do one of the following:   * To download the schema for the currently-select NAP, click the gear   icon (Gear/Settings button.) and select Download > Policy Schema. * To download the saved set of overrides, as they existed prior to the   current editing session, click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) and select Download > Last Saved Overrides. The file includes overridden attributes plus their   containing objects. * To download the overrides you have created in the current editing   session, click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) and select Download > Current Unsaved Overrides. The file includes overridden attributes plus their   containing objects. |

---

### Uploading Overrides

Rather than editing attributes using the embedded JSON editor, you can download the
NAP policy schema, edit the file offline, then upload the file. Any overrides
configured in the uploaded file are then applied to the selected NAP.

You can also upload a file you downloaded after configuring overrides on another
device.

By uploading your overrides, you can upload the same file to multiple devices and
easily apply the same overrides.

#### Before you begin

For overriding an inspector configuration in the network analysis policy, you should
upload only the changes that you require. You should not upload the entire
configuration because it makes the overrides sticky in nature and therefore, any
subsequent changes to the default values or configuration as part of the LSP updates
would not be applied. Ensure that your uploaded overrides are tightly focused on
just those attributes you want to change.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion, click the  Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button. ), select Custom for the NAP settings, then click the Edit link next to the policy name. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) and select Upload > Overrides. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional.) Click one of the Download links to save a copy of your existing overrides.  You can either download the last saved overrides (those made before the current editing session) or the current unsaved overrides (those made during the current editing session). |
| **Step 4** | Click Yes on the Confirm Upload Overrides dialog box to confirm you want to continue. |
| **Step 5** | Click Browse, or drag and drop, to select the JSON file that contains your overrides, and click OK. |

## Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 3)

When you use Snort 3 as the inspection engine, you can create your own intrusion
policies and customize them for your purposes. The system comes with pre-defined
policies that are based on the same-named Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos)-defined policies. Although you can edit these policies, a better practice is to
create your own policy based on the underlying Talos policy and change that if you need to adjust rule actions.

Each of these pre-defined policies includes the same list of intrusion rules (also
known as signatures), but they differ in the actions taken for each rule. For
example, a rule might be enabled in one policy, but disabled in another policy.

If you find that a particular rule is giving you too many false positives, where the
rule is blocking traffic that you do not want blocked, you can disable the rule
without needing to switch to a less-secure intrusion policy. You could alternatively
change it to alert on matches without dropping traffic.

Conversely, if you know you need to protect against a specific attack, but the
related rule is disabled in your chosen intrusion policy, you can enable the rule
without changing to a more secure policy.

Use the intrusion related dashboards, and the Event Viewer (both on the
Monitoring page), to evaluate how intrusion rules are
impacting traffic. Keep in mind that you will see intrusion events and intrusion
data only for traffic that matches intrusion rules set to alert or drop; disabled
rules are not evaluated.

| **Note** | ---   If you switch to Snort 2, you cannot create custom policies, and the use of intrusion policies differs slightly. Instead of this topic, see [Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 2)](#concept_C0EB1AB846C945C38FE3940BBC8803F7).   --- |

### Configuring a Custom Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)

You can create new intrusion policies to customize rule behavior if the pre-defined
policies do not fit your needs. In general, it is good practice to create custom
policies based on the pre-defined policies rather than to alter those policies. This
ensures you can easily implement one of the Cisco Talos defined policies if you find
that your customizations do not deliver the results that you need.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do one of the following:   * To create a new policy, click +. * To edit an existing policy, click the edit icon (edit icon) for the policy. When you are shown the policy details, click the   Edit link in the policy properties   section at the top of the page. |
| **Step 3** | Enter a Name, and optionally, a description for the policy. |
| **Step 4** | Configure the Inspection Mode for the policy.   * Prevention—Intrusion rule actions are always   applied. Connections that match a drop rule are blocked. * Detection—Intrusion rules generate alerts   only. A connection that matches a drop rule will generate alert   messages, but the connection will not be blocked. |
| **Step 5** | Select the Base Template for the policy.  The base templates are provided by Cisco Talos. Click the info icon for each to see more information about the policies. Note that policy names can change, and new policies appear, when a new rules package gets installed.   * Maximum Detection (Cisco Talos)—This policy   places all emphasis on security. Network connectivity and throughput   is not guaranteed and false positives are likely. This policy should   only be used for high security areas and security monitors must be   prepared to investigate alerts to determine their validity. * Security Over Connectivity (Cisco Talos)—This   policy places an emphasis on security, at the possible expense of   network connectivity and throughput. Traffic is inspected more   deeply, more rules are evaluated, and both false positives and   increased latency are expected but within reason. * Balanced Security and Connectivity (Cisco   Talos)—(Default.) This policy attempts to strike the   delicate balance between network connectivity and throughput and the   needs of security. While not as strict as Security Over   Connectivity, this policy attempts to keep users secure while being   less obtrusive about normal traffic. * Connectivity Over Security (Cisco Talos)—This   policy places an emphasis on network connectivity and throughput, at   the possible expense of security. Traffic is inspected less deeply,   and fewer rules are evaluated. * No Rules Active (Cisco Talos)—This policy is a   basic policy that configures typical preprocessor settings but does   not have any rules or built-in alerts enabled. Use this policy as a   base if you want to ensure that only those policies you want to   apply are enabled. |
| **Step 6** | Click OK.  You are returned to the intrusion policy list. You can now view the new policy and adjust rule actions as needed. |

### Viewing or Editing Intrusion Policy Properties (Snort 3)

The Intrusion Policy page shows a list of the policies, including both pre-defined
and user-defined policies, and their descriptions. To edit a policy, you must first
view the policy's properties.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  The policy contains the following sections:   * Policy Name drop-down list.    + You can easily switch to a different policy by selecting it     from the drop-down list, or return to the list of policies     by clicking the back button (Go Back to Virtual Routers arrow.).   + You can delete this policy by clicking the delete icon next     to the policy name (delete icon). * General properties. This section shows the   intrusion mode, base policy, and description. Click   Edit to change these properties or the   policy name. * Rule Group table of contents. This list   displays all the rule groups that have active rules in the policy.   The groups have a hierarchy, with parent groups containing child   groups that organize subsets of rules within the larger parent   group. Each group is a logical collection of rules, and a given rule   can appear in more than one group.    + To add a group that currently has no active rules in the     policy, click + > Add Existing Rule Group and select the group. See [Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_2d4f4706-b442-4ed1-8d9f-73abb005f21a).   + To change the security level of a group, select the child     group in the list. The rule list changes to show the     security level at the top, with the rules in the group     listed below. Click the Edit link     next to the security level and select a new level. Click     View Description when editing to     get information about each security level. Note that     changing the level can change which rules are active, and     also the action for a given rule, with more secure levels     tending to have more active rules and more rules with the     Drop action. Click OK to confirm the     change. (Security Level     does not apply to custom rule groups.)      Changing the security level for an existing rule group.   + To remove all the rules in a group, select the child group in     the list. Then, click the Exclude     link to the far right of the group name and confirm that you     want to exclude the group. Excluding the group simply     disables all the rules in the group. It does not delete the     group.  However, if the group includes rules that are shared with     other groups that are enabled, the shared rules retain     whatever actions are applied by the still-active group. In     all cases, we retain your most aggressive setting for an     individual rule, regardless of group membership.   + To add a new custom rule group of custom rules, click + > Upload Custom Rules. For details, see [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864).   + To change the name or description of a custom rule group,     click Edit.   + To delete a custom rule group, click     Delete. For more information, see     [Managing Custom Intrusion Rules and Rule Groups](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_1704f9a7-4642-48db-a5db-1938d5494c4b).   + To add a new custom rule in a custom rule group, click     + above the rule table. See [Configuring Individual Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_75af97a5-8671-4f83-9924-e48860433a3e).   + To edit, duplicate, delete, or manage group membership for a     custom rule, mouse over the right of the rule and click the     appropriate button or command. For more information, see     [Configuring Individual Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_75af97a5-8671-4f83-9924-e48860433a3e). * List of rules. You can use the search field to   help you find rules using full-text search. You can also select   filtering items to search on any combination of GID or SID, show only user defined rules   (those you added), or   simply show rules based on their actions (disabled, alert, drop).   The rules are lazy-loaded, so it will take quite a bit of time to   scroll through the entire unfiltered list. When filtering the list,   click the refresh button to reload the filtered view.    + To change the action for a rule, click the     Action cell for the rule and     select the new action, to Alert only,     to Block matching traffic, or to     Disable the rule. The default     action for each rule is indicated.   + To change the action for more than one rule at a time, click     the check box in the left column of the rules you want to     change, then select the new action from the     Action drop-down list above the     rules table. Click the check box in the GID:SID header to     select all the rules in the list. You can change up to 5000     rules at a time.   + To update the rules within a custom rule group, click     Upload Rule File. For more     information, see [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864).   + To get more information about a rule, click the link in the     GID:SID cell. The link takes you     to Snort.org.   + To change the rules listed, you can click a child group from     the rule group table of contents (not a parent group). You     can return to the all-rules list by clicking ALL     RULES at the top of the rule group list.   + To change the sorting order, click the table header for a     column. The default sorting for the rules is overridden     rules first, then drop rules, then alert rules.   + To see what changes where made in an intrusion rule (LSP)     update, select LSP Update in the     filter field, then select the updates whose changes you want     to see, and specify whether you want to see all changes, or     just additions or changes to the rules. |

### Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)

Intrusion rules are organized in local groups. There is a hierarchy to the groups,
with parent groups containing related child groups. The rules themselves appear in
child groups only: parent groups are simply an organizational construct. A given
rule can appear in more than one group.

Any custom rule groups you create are in the User
Defined Groups folder. Custom rule groups do not have a hierarchy.

The easiest way to add or remove rules in an intrusion policy is to add or remove
groups. Because the rules in a group are logically related, it is highly likely that
you will want to use most if not all rules within a given group.

The following procedure explains how to add groups and change the group’s security
level.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for the policy you want to change. |
| **Step 3** | (Adding groups.) If the group is not shown in the list of rule groups, click + > Add Existing Rule Group and do the following:   1. Find the child group.     * A check mark next to a parent group name indicates that all      child groups in the parent group are already selected.    * A minus mark next to a parent group name indicates that one      or more child group has no enabled rules for this policy.      These are the groups you can add.    * A check mark next to a child group name indicates the group      is already selected. 2. Select the group you want to add (that is, check its check box). 3. (Optional, does not apply to custom    rule groups.) Each group has a default security level depending    on the base policy used for the custom policy. If you want to change it,    click the security level icon, select a new level, and click    OK.  Level 1 is the least secure posture, emphasizing connectivity over    security, whereas level 4 is the most aggressive, providing maximum    security. You can click View Description to    see an explanation of each level as you select it.     Changing security level while adding a rule group. 4. Continue selecting (or deselecting) groups until you have made all of    your changes. 5. Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | (Removing groups.) If you want to disable all the rules within a group, you can use any of the following methods:   * Select the group, then click the Exclude link   to the far right of the group name, above the list of rules. * Use the method for adding a group, but instead, deselect the unwanted   group (that is, uncheck its check box), and click   OK. * You can delete a custom rule group to remove it entirely from the   system and from all intrusion policies that use it. Select the   group, then click Delete. |

### Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 3)

Each intrusion policy has the same rules. The difference is the action taken for each
rule can be different from policy to policy.

By changing the rule action, you can disable rules that are giving you too many false
positives, or you can change whether the rule alerts on or drops matching traffic.
You can also enable disabled rules to alert or drop matching traffic.

The easiest method to change rule actions is to change the security level of a rule
group. When you change a group's security level, the action of the rules within the
group change. This can mean that some rules become enabled (or disabled), or the
action can change between alert and drop, based on the security posture you select.
However, you can change an individual rule action if that is what you need.

| **Note** | ---   The default action for a given rule is based on the overall selection of group and severity. Changing the severity of the group, or excluding the group, can change the default action for the rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Custom rule groups do not have security levels. You cannot use the security level
technique to change rule actions for custom rules.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the view icon (View configuration button.) for the policy whose rule actions you want to change. |
| **Step 3** | (Recommended method.) Change the security level for a rule group.   1. Click the child rule group in the rule group list. 2. Above the list of rules, click Edit next to the    security level for the group.     Changing the security level for an existing rule group.        | **Note** | If you want to disable all the rules in the group, do not click Edit. Instead, click Exclude and confirm that you want to exclude the group. The group is not deleted, its rules are simply disabled. Skip the remaining steps. |    | --- | --- | 3. Select the new level for the group. Click View    Description to see an explanation of each level as you    pick it.  Level 1 is the least secure posture, emphasizing connectivity over    security, whereas level 4 is the most aggressive, providing maximum    security. 4. Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | (Manual method.) Change the action for one or more rule.   1. Find the rule whose action you want to change.  Use the Search/Filter box to search on strings    within the rule information. You can also select filtering items to    search on any combination of GID or SID, or simply show rules based    on their actions (disabled, alert, drop). The rules are lazy-loaded,    so it will take quite a bit of time to scroll through the entire    unfiltered list. When filtering the list, click the refresh button    to reload the filtered view.  Ideally, you can get the Snort identifier (SID) and generator    identifier (GID) from an event or from Cisco Technical Support, if    you are working with them on an issue. You can then search precisely    for the rule. 2. To change the action, do one of the following:     * Change one rule at a time—Click the      Action column for the rule and      select the required action:       + Alert—Create an event when        this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the        connection.      + Drop—Create an event when this        rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection.      + Disabled—Do not match traffic        against this rule. No events are generated.    * Change multiple rules at one time—Click the check boxes for      the rules you want to change, then click the      Bulk drop-down above the table      and pick the desired action. Click the check box in the      GID:SID header to select all the rules in the list. You can      change up to 5000 rules at a time. |

---

### Managing Custom Intrusion Rules and Rule Groups

The system comes with thousands of intrusion rules defined by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos). If you know of additional attacks, you can create and upload custom intrusion
rules to screen for those attacks, and either alert or drop them. You can also
create, edit, and delete rules one at a time.

For uploaded rules, you create the rules offline using a text editor. We recommend
that you include a group of custom rules in each text file you upload. You can then
easily upload changes to your rules, and either merge new rules into your custom
rule groups, or replace your rules with new, edited copies.

Explaining how to create these rules is outside the scope of this document. For
detailed information on how to write intrusion rules for Snort, including how to
convert Snort 2 rules to Snort 3 format, see the guides on <https://snort.org/documents>. For
example, Rules Authors Introduction to Writing Snort 3 Rules at <https://snort.org/documents/rules-writers-guide-to-snort-3-rules>.

#### Before you begin

You create custom rule groups during the process of uploading custom rules, as
described in [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864), or when creating individual rules or
managing rule membership. After you create the group, you can manage the group and
its contents.

Note that custom groups are available for all intrusion policies, not just the policy
you were editing when you created the group. Thus, changes you make to a group are
made for all policies. For example, if you delete a custom rule group, it is deleted
from all policies and is no longer available for any of them.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  We recommend that you add custom rules to a custom intrusion policy rather than one of the built-in policies. |
| **Step 3** | Do any of the following:   * To create a group, click + > Upload Custom Rules. See [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864). * To edit a group’s name or description, select the group in the group   table of contents in the User Defined Groups folder. You can then   click Edit and make your changes. * To exclude the group and its rules from the policy, select the group   in the group table of contents in the User Defined Groups folder.   You can then click Exclude to remove the   group. * To delete the group from the system and all policies that use it,   select the group in the group table of contents in the User Defined   Groups folder. Then click Delete. Note that   if a rule exists only in the deleted group, it is also deleted from   the system. However, if a rule also exists in other custom rule   groups that you are not deleting, the rule will remain in those   groups. * To replace or update the rules in a group in bulk, select the group   in the group table of contents in the User Defined Groups folder.   Then, click Upload Rule File next to the   Action drop-down list above the group’s rule table. The process is   the same as that described in [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864). * To create and manage individual rules, and their assignment to rule   groups, see [Configuring Individual Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_75af97a5-8671-4f83-9924-e48860433a3e). |

#### Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules

If you know of attacks that are not currently covered by other rules, you can create
and upload custom intrusion rules to screen for those attacks, and either alert or
drop them. The action of the imported rules must be either alert or drop, and the
default action for the rule is defined by the action in the imported file. Once
imported, you can change a rule action and disable a rule if necessary.

You must create these rules offline. In the FDM, you are simply uploading a rules file, you are not configuring the rules directly. The rules file should be a text file.
You can use line returns to format the rules to be readable, or put a rule on a single line, and empty lines are allowed.
Rule format is explained at snort.org.

For example, an upload file of three rules could look like the following:

```

alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (
   msg: "My Custom Rule: EXPLOIT-KIT Styx exploit kit landing page request";
   flow:to_server,established;
   http_raw_uri;
   bufferlen:>100;
   http_uri;
   content:"/i.html?",depth 8; pcre:"/\/i\.html\?[a-z0-9]+\=[a-zA-Z0-9]{25}/";
   flowbits:set,styx_landing;
   metadata: copied from talos sid 29452;
   service:http;
   classtype:trojan-activity;
   gid:1;
   sid:1000000;
   rev:1;
)

alert tcp $HOME_NET 8811 -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (
   msg:"My Custom rule: MALWARE-BACKDOOR fear1.5/aciddrop1.0 runtime detection - initial connection";
   flow:to_client,established;
   flowbits:isset,Fear15_conn.2;
   content:"Drive",nocase;
   metadata:copied from talos sid 7710;
   classtype:trojan-activity;
   gid:1;
   sid:1000001;
   rev:1;
)

alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $FILE_DATA_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (
   msg:"My Custom Rule: INDICATOR-COMPROMISE download of a Office document with embedded PowerShell";
   flow:to_client,established;
   flowbits:isset,file.doc;
   file_data;
   content:"powershell.exe",fast_pattern,nocase;
   metadata:copied from talos sid 37244;
   classtype:trojan-activity;
   gid:1;
   sid:1000002;
   rev:1;
)
```

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  We recommend that you add custom rules to a custom intrusion policy rather than one of the built-in policies. |
| **Step 3** | Do one of the following:   * Above the list of groups, click + > Upload Custom Rules. * If you are uploading rules into a custom rule group that you already   created, you can select the custom rule group, then click   Upload Rule File next to the   Action drop-down list above the group’s   rule table. |
| **Step 4** | Click Browse and select your custom rule file, or drag and drop the file into the Upload File dialog box.  Wait for the upload to complete. |
| **Step 5** | Select how you want to handle conflicts:  A conflict occurs when a rule you are adding is the same as one already in the system. This should happen only if you are uploading the same rules or edited versions of rules that you previously uploaded.  Select one of these options:   | **Note** | Merge and Replace are basically the same thing. Uploaded rules must have higher revision numbers than the ones you already uploaded for any changes to be made to the existing rules. The only difference is that if the upload file is missing rules that are in the targeted custom rule group, the Replace option will delete those rules from the rule group. The Merge option will leave those "missing" rules in place. | | --- | --- |  * Merge—Any changed rules in the uploaded file   that also exist in the selected group will have those changes   merged, if the rule in the uploaded file has a higher revision   number. Any unchanged rules, or rules in the group that do not have   corresponding rules in the upload, will be left unchanged. Any new   rules in the upload will be added. This is the default option. * Replace—The rules in the uploaded file will   replace the rules in the selected group, if the revision number on   the uploaded rule is higher. Any existing rules not in the uploaded   file will be deleted from the group. Existing rules whose uploaded   version has a revision number that is the same or lower will be left   unchanged. Any new rules in the upload will be added. |
| **Step 6** | Click + and select the custom rule group for the uploaded rules.  If the custom rule group you want to use does not yet exist, click Create New Group and create it now. The new group needs a name and optionally, a description. Then, you can select the new group.  If you are replacing rules, you can select a single group only. If you are merging them, you can select multiple groups. |
| **Step 7** | Click OK.  The files are uploaded and placed in the new group. You should see a summary of how many rules were uploaded, and how many rules were updated, deleted, or ignored.  If there are errors in the file, the upload will fail. You can click the Download Error File link to get more information on the errors.  The group is automatically activated in this intrusion policy. The group and new rules are available to be added to other policies, but the group and rules are not automatically enabled in any other policy. For information on adding groups to other policies, see [Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_2d4f4706-b442-4ed1-8d9f-73abb005f21a). |

#### Configuring Individual Custom Intrusion Rules

You can configure custom intrusion rules one at a time rather than in bulk through
file uploads. This method works well when you need to make a quick adjustment to a
rule, or you need to create or modify just a few rules at a time.

When configuring intrusion rules, keep the following in mind:

* The GID for all custom rules should be 1.
* The SID for a rule must be unique across all rules in the system. It also
  must be one million (1000000) or higher.
* If you edit a rule, you must change the rule version. Normally, you increment
  the version number by 1.
* You can duplicate a Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
  (Talos) rule to create your own version of the rule, but you still must change
  the SID of the duplicate to make it unique.

The system will do some validity checking to ensure the rule is well formed, and you
will see error messages about any problems. However, the system cannot determine
whether the rule is sensible.

For detailed information on how to write intrusion rules for Snort, including how to
convert Snort 2 rules to Snort 3 format, see the guides on <https://snort.org/documents>. For
example, Rules Authors Introduction to Writing Snort 3 Rules at <https://snort.org/documents/rules-writers-guide-to-snort-3-rules>.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  We recommend that you add custom rules to a custom intrusion policy rather than one of the built-in policies. |
| **Step 3** | Do one of the following:   * To add an intrusion rule, click the Add New Intrusion   Rule button (+) above the   rule table. When adding a rule, you must select one or more custom   rule groups to contain the new rule. You can create new groups while   adding the rule if necessary. * To add a rule by duplicating and editing an existing rule, mouse over   the right end of the rule and click the Duplicate (Copy connection summary to clipboard button.) button. The button appears only on mouse-over. For custom rules,   the Duplicate command is under the more   options (...) button. * To edit a custom rule, find the rule in a custom rule group and click   the edit (edit icon) button for the rule. Your edits apply across all groups in which   the rule resides. Make sure you increment the rule version number by   at least 1 when making changes. * To delete a custom rule, click the delete (delete icon) button for the rule. The rule is deleted from all rule groups   that contain it. If you just want to remove a rule from a group, use   the Manage Group Assignments option instead   of deleting the rule. * To change which groups contain the rule, click the more options   (...) button and select Manage   Group Assignments. You can then add or remove   groups. Your changes simply affect group membership, it does not   change the rule or delete it. |
| **Step 4** | For new rules and groups, add the rule to the policy.  When you create a new group when creating a new rule, or editing an existing rule, that group is not added to your policy automatically, nor is the rule enabled automatically. You are prompted to add the group to the policy you are editing. If you do not add the group while adding or editing the rule, you can add the group later using the following process:   1. Click + > Add Existing Rule Group above the group table of contents. 2. Find the group under the User Defined Groups folder, select it, and    click OK. 3. Select the group in the table of contents and verify that the new rule    is in the group and has the desired action. |

## Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 2)

You can apply any of the pre-defined intrusion policies. Each of these policies includes the same
list of intrusion rules (also known as signatures), but they differ in the actions taken
for each rule. For example, a rule might be active in one policy, but disabled in
another policy.

If you find that a
particular rule is giving you too many false positives, where the rule is
blocking traffic that you do not want blocked, you can disable the rule without
needing to switch to a less-secure intrusion policy. You could alternatively
change it to alert on matches without dropping traffic.

Conversely, if you know you need to protect against a specific attack, but the related rule is disabled in your chosen intrusion
policy, you can enable the rule without changing to a more secure policy.

Use the intrusion
related dashboards, and the Event Viewer (both on the
Monitoring page), to evaluate how intrusion rules
are impacting traffic. Keep in mind that you will see intrusion events and
intrusion data only for traffic that matches intrusion rules set to alert or
drop; disabled rules are not evaluated.

The following topics
explain intrusion policies and rule tuning in more detail.

* [Configure the Inspection Mode for an Intrusion Policy (Snort 2)](#id_121662)
* [Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)](#task_4D5DD40DDCE0426C8846E5684287E63B)

### Configure the Inspection Mode for an Intrusion Policy (Snort 2)

By default, all intrusion policies operate in Prevention mode to implement an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). In the Prevention
inspection mode, if a connection matches an intrusion rule whose action is to drop traffic, the connection is actively blocked.

If you instead want to test the effect of the intrusion policy on your network, you can change the mode to Detection, which
implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In this inspection mode, drop rules are treat like alert rules, where you
are notified of matching connections, but the action result becomes Would Have Blocked, and connections are never in fact
blocked.

You change the inspection mode per intrusion policy, so you can have a mix of prevention and detection.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab for the intrusion policy whose inspection mode you want to change.  The Inspection Mode is indicated above the rules table. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Edit link next to the inspection mode, change the mode for the policy, and click OK.  The options are:   * Prevention—Intrusion rule actions are always applied. Connections that match a drop rule are blocked. * Detection—Intrusion rules generate alerts only. A connection that matches a drop rule will generate alert messages, but the connection   will not be blocked. |

---

### Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)

Each pre-defined
intrusion policy has the same rules. The difference is the action taken for
each rule can be different from policy to policy.

By changing the rule action, you can disable rules that are giving you too many false positives, or you can change whether
the rule alerts on or drops matching traffic. You can also enable disabled rules to alert or drop matching traffic.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab for the intrusion policy whose rule actions you want to change.  The pre-defined policies are:   * Connectivity   over Security * Balanced   Security and Connectivity * Security   over Connectivity * Maximum   Detection |
| **Step 3** | Find the rule whose action you want to change.  The rules are sorted with the overridden ones listed first, and sorted by action within the group of overridden rules. Otherwise, the rules are sorted by GID, then SID.  Use the search box to locate the rule you want to change. Ideally, you can get the Snort identifier (SID) and generator identifier (GID) from an event or from Cisco Technical Support, if you are working with them on an issue.  For detailed information about the elements of each rule, see [Intrusion Rule Attributes](#concept_C4C21B1BDF794F468738C9F836C6C87B).  To search the list:   1. Click in the    Search box to open the search attributes dialog box. 2. Enter a    combination of Generator ID (GID), Snort ID (SID), or rule    Action, and click    Search.  For example,    you could select    Action = Drop to see all the rules in the policy    that will drop matching connections. The text beside the search box indicates    how many rules match your criteria, for example, “8937 of 9416 rules found.”  To clear a    search criteria, click the x for the criteria in the search box. |
| **Step 4** | Click the Action column for the rule and select the required action:   * Alert—Create an   event when this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the connection. * Drop—Create an   event when this rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection. * Disabled—Do not   match traffic against this rule. No events are generated.   The default action for the rule is indicated by “(Default)” added to the action. If you change the default, the status column indicates “Overridden” for that rule. |

## Monitoring Intrusion Policies

You can find intrusion
policy statistics on the
Attackers and
Targets dashboards on the
Monitoring page. You must apply an intrusion policy
to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
See
[Monitoring Traffic and System Dashboards](fptd-fdm-monitor.html#id_10212).

To see intrusion
events, select
Monitoring > Events, then click the
Intrusion tab. You can hover over an event and
click the
View Details link to get more information. From
the details page, you can click the
View IPS Rule to go to the rule in the relevant
intrusion policy, where you can change the rule action. This can help you
reduce the impact of false positives, where a rule is blocking too many good
connections, by changing the action from drop to alert. Conversely, you can
change an alert rule into a drop rule if you are seeing a lot of attack traffic
for a rule.

If you configure a syslog server for the intrusion policy, intrusion events have the message ID 430001.

## Network Analysis Policy Basics

*Network analysis policies* govern many traffic preprocessing options, and are invoked by advanced settings in your access control policy. Network analysis-related
preprocessing occurs after Security Intelligence matching and SSL decryption, but before intrusion or file inspection begins.

By default, the system uses the
*Balanced Security and Connectivity* network analysis policy
to preprocess all traffic handled by an access control policy. However, you can
choose a different default network analysis policy to perform this
preprocessing. For your convenience, the system provides a choice of several
non-modifiable network analysis policies, which are tuned for a specific
balance of security and connectivity by the
Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos).
You can also create a custom network analysis policy with custom preprocessing
settings.

| **Tip** | ---   System-provided intrusion and network analysis policies are similarly named but contain different configurations. For example, the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis policy and the Balanced Security and Connectivity intrusion policy work together and can both be updated in intrusion rule updates. However, the network analysis policy governs mostly preprocessing options, whereas the intrusion policy governs mostly intrusion rules. Network analysis and intrusion policies work together to examine your traffic.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can also tailor traffic preprocessing options to specific
security zones, networks, and VLANs by creating multiple custom network
analysis policies, then assigning them to preprocess different traffic. (Note
that
ASA FirePOWER
cannot restrict preprocessing by VLAN.)

## Managing Network Analysis Policies

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays policies created in the current domain, which you can edit. It also displays
policies created in ancestor domains, which you cannot edit. To view and edit policies created in a lower domain, switch to
that domain.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies.   | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Manage your network analysis policy:   * Compare—Click Compare Policies; see [Comparing Policies](policy_management.html#task_ABA1FE48DBBB44BC9FF40243FCC58BF6). * Create — If you want to create a new network analysis policy, click Create Policy.  Two versions of the network analysis policy are created, a Snort 2 Version and a Snort 3 Version.    + For the Snort 2 version, proceed as described in [Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 2](#ID-2245-00000053).   + For the Snort 3 version, proceed as described in . * Delete — If you want to delete a network analysis policy, click Delete (delete icon), then confirm that you want to delete the policy. You cannot delete a network analysis policy if an access control policy   references it.  If the controls are dimmed, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the   configuration. * Deploy—Choose Deploy > Deployment; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](policy_management.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B). * Edit — If you want to edit an existing network analysis policy, click Edit (edit icon) and proceed as described in [Network Analysis Policy Settings and Cached Changes](#ID-2245-000000e0).  If View (View button) appears instead, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. * Report—Click Report (Report icon) ; see [Generating Current Policy Reports](policy_management.html#task_CCED983433824793AF09203FDAD1AF53). |

### Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 3

The default network analysis policy is tuned for typical network requirements and optimal performance. Usually, the default
network analysis policy suffices most network requirements and you might not need to customize the policy. However, when you
have a specific network requirement or when you are facing performance issues, the default network analysis policy can be
customized. Note that customizing the network analysis policy is an advanced configuration that should be done only by advanced
users or Cisco support.

Network analysis policy configuration for Snort 3 is a data-driven model, which is based on JSON and JSON Schema. Schema is
based on the OpenAPI specification, and it helps you get a view of the supported inspectors, settings, settings type, and
valid values. The Snort 3 inspectors are plugins that process packets (similar to the Snort 2 preprocessor). Network analysis
policy configuration is available to download in the JSON format.

In Snort 3, the list of inspectors and settings are not in a one-to-one mapping with the Snort 2 list of preprocessors and
settings. Also, the number of inspectors and settings available in FMC is a subset of the inspectors and settings that Snort 3 supports. See <https://snort.org/snort3> for more information on Snort 3. See <https://www.cisco.com/go/snort3-inspectors> for more information on the inspectors available in FMC.

| **Note** | ---  * While upgrading the FMC to the 7.0 release, the changes that were done in the Snort 2 version of the network analysis policy are not migrated to   Snort 3 after the upgrade. * Unlike the intrusion policy, there is no option to synchronize Snort 2 network analysis policy settings to Snort 3.  --- |

#### Default Inspector Updates

Lightweight Security Package (LSP) updates may contain new inspectors or modifications to integer ranges for existing inspector
configurations. Following the installation of an LSP, new inspectors and/or updated ranges will be available under Inspectors in the Snort 3 Version of your network analysis policy.

#### Binder Inspector

Binder inspector defines the flow when a particular inspector has to be accessed and taken into consideration. When the traffic
matches the conditions defined in the binder inspector, only then the values/configurations for that inspector come into effect.
For example:

For the *imap* inspector, the binder defines the following condition when it has to be accessed. That is when:

* Service is equal to imap.
* Role is equal to any.

If these conditions are met, then use the type imap.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/455001-456000/455524.jpg)

#### Singleton Inspectors

Singleton inspectors contain a single instance. These inspectors do not support adding more instances like multiton inspectors.
Settings of singleton inspector are applied to the entire traffic and not to a specific traffic segment.

For example:

```
{
   "normalizer":{
      "enabled":true,
      "type":"singleton",
      "data":{
         "ip4":{
            "df":true
         }
      }
   }
}
```

#### Multiton Inspectors

Multiton inspectors contain multiple instances which you can configure as needed. These inspectors support configuring settings
based on specific conditions, such as network, port, and VLAN. One set of supported settings is called an instance. There
is a default instance, and you can also add additional instances based on specific conditions. If the traffic matches that
condition, the settings from that instance are applied. Otherwise, the settings from the default instance are applied. Also,
the name of the default instance is the same as the inspector's name.

For a multiton inspector, when you upload the overridden inspector configuration, you also need to include/define a matching
binder condition (conditions under when the inspector has to be accessed or used) for each instance in the JSON file, otherwise,
the upload will result in an error. You can also create new instances, but make sure that you include a binder condition for
every new instance that you create to avoid errors.

For example:

* Multiton inspector where the default instance is modified.

  ```
  {
     "http_inspect":{
        "enabled":true,
        "type":"multiton",
        "instances":[
           {
              "name":"http_inspect",
              "data":{
                 "response_depth":5000
              }
           }
        ]
     }
  }
  ```
* Multiton inspector where the default instance and default binder is modified.

  ```
  {
     "http_inspect":{
        "enabled":true,
        "type":"multiton",
        "instances":[
           {
              "name":"http_inspect",
              "data":{
                 "response_depth":5000
              }
           }
        ]
     },
     "binder":{
        "type":"binder",
        "enabled":true,
        "rules":[
           {
              "use":{
                 "type":"http_inspect"
              },
              "when":{
                 "role":"any",
                 "ports":"8080",
                 "proto":"tcp",
                 "service":"http"
              }
           }
        ]
     }
  }
  ```
* Multiton inspector where a custom instance and a custom binder is added.

  ```
  {
     "http_inspect":{
        "enabled":true,
        "type":"multiton",
        "instances":[
           {
              "name":"http_inspect1",
              "data":{
                 "response_depth":5000
              }
           }
        ]
     },
     "binder":{
        "type":"binder",
        "enabled":true,
        "rules":[
           {
              "use":{
                 "type":"http_inspect",
                 "name":"http_inspect1"

#### Network Analysis Policy Mapping

For network analysis policies, Cisco Talos provides mapping information, which is used to find the corresponding Snort 2 version of the policies for the Snort 3 version.

This mapping ensures that the Snort 3 version of policies has its equivalent Snort 2 version.

#### View Network Analysis Policy Mapping

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Policies > Intrusion > Network Analysis Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click NAP Mapping. |
| **Step 3** | Expand the arrow for View Mappings.  The Snort 3 network analysis policies that are automatically mapped to a Snort 2 equivalent policy are displayed. |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

---

#### Create a Network Analysis Policy

All the existing network analysis policies are available in FMC with their corresponding Snort 2 and Snort 3 versions. When you create a new network analysis policy, it is created with
both the Snort 2 version and the Snort 3 version.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Policies > Intrusion > Network Analysis Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Create Policy. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the Name and Description. |
| **Step 4** | Choose the Inspection Mode from the available choices.   * Detection * Prevention |
| **Step 5** | Select a Base Policy and click Save.   | **Note** | Configure Network Analysis Policy (NAP) in Prevention mode if you are using Snort 3 and SSL Decryption or TLS Server Identity. | | --- | --- | |

---

The new network analysis policy is created with its corresponding Snort 2 Version and Snort 3 Version.

#### Modify the Network Analysis Policy

You can modify the network analysis policy to change its name, description, or the base policy.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Policies > Intrusion > Network Analysis Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Edit to change the name, description, inspection mode, or the base policy.   | **Note** | If you edit the network analysis policy name, description, base policy, and inspection mode, the edits are applied to both the Snort 2 and Snort 3 versions. If you want to change the inspection mode for a specific version, then you can do that from within the network analysis policy page for that respective version. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | Click Save. |

---

#### Customize the Network Analysis Policy

You can customize the Snort 3 version of the network analysis policy according to your requirements.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Policies > Intrusion > Network Analysis Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Go to the Snort 3 Version of the network analysis policy. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Actions drop-down menu.  The following options are displayed: |
| **Step 4** | Click View Schema to open the schema file directly in a browser. |
| **Step 5** | You can download the schema file, sample file / template, full configuration, or overridden configuration as needed.  These options provide you an insight about the allowed values, range, and patterns, existing and default inspector configurations, and overridden inspector configurations.   1. Click to download the schema file.  The schema file validates the content that you upload or download. You can download the schema file and open it using any    third-party JSON editor. The schema file helps you to identify what parameters can be configured for inspectors with their    corresponding allowed values, range, and accepted patterns to be used.  For example, for the *arp\_spoof\_snort* inspector, you can configure the hosts. The hosts include the *mac* and *ip* address values. The schema file shows the following accepted pattern for these values.     * mac – `pattern: ^([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}[:-]){5}([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})$`    * ip – `pattern: ^([0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}(/[0-9]{1,2}){0,1})$` You must provide the values, range, patterns according to the accepted ones in the schema file to be able to successfully    override the inspector configuration, otherwise, you get an error message. 2. Click to use a pre-existing template that contains example configurations to help you with configuring the inspectors.  You can refer to the example configurations included in the sample file and make any changes that you may require. 3. Click to download the entire inspector configurations in a single JSON file.  Instead of expanding the inspectors separately, you can download the full configuration to look out for the information you    need. All information regarding the inspector configuration is available in this file. 4. Click    to download the inspector configuration that has been overridden. |
| **Step 6** | To override the existing configuration, follow the steps.  You can choose to override an inspector configuration using the following ways.   * Make inline edits for an inspector directly on the FMC. See the topic **Make Inline Edit for an Inspector to Override Configuration** in the **Getting Started with Network Analysis Policies** chapter of the *Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide*. * Continue to follow the current procedure of using the Actions drop-down menu to upload the overridden configuration file.   If you chose to make inline edits directly in the FMC, then you don't need to follow the current procedure further. Otherwise, you must follow this procedure completely.   1. Under Inspectors, expand the required inspector for which you want to override the default configuration.  The default configuration is displayed on the left column and the overridden configuration is displayed on the right column    under the inspector.  You may need to search for an inspector by entering any relevant text in in the search bar. 2. Click the Copy to clipboard icon to copy the default inspector configuration to the clipboard. 3. Create a JSON file and paste the default configuration in it. 4. Keep the inspector configuration that you want to override, and remove all the other configuration and instances from the    JSON file.  You can also use the Sample File / Template to understand how to override the default configuration. This is a sample file that includes JSON snippets explaining how    you can customize the network analysis policy for Snort 3. 5. Make changes to the inspector configuration as needed.  Validate the changes and make sure they conform to the schema file. For multiton inspectors, make sure that the binder conditions    for all instances are included in the JSON file. See *Multiton Inspectors* in the topic **Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 3** in the *Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide* for more information. 6. If you are copying any further default inspector configurations, append that inspector configuration to the existing file    that contains the overridden configuration.         | **Note** | The copied inspector configuration must comply with the JSON standards. |    | --- | --- | 7. Save the overridden configuration file to your system. |
| **Step 7** | to upload the JSON file that contains the overridden configuration.   | **Caution** | Upload only the changes that you require. You should not upload the entire configuration as it makes the overrides sticky in nature and therefore, any subsequent changes to the default configuration as part of the LSP updates would not be applied. | | --- | --- |   You can drag and drop a file or click to browse to the JSON file saved in your system that contains the overridden inspector configuration.   * Merge inspector overrides – Content in the uploaded file is merged with the existing configuration if there is no common inspector. If there are common   inspectors, then the content in the uploaded file (for common inspectors) takes precedence over the previous content, and   it replaces the previous configuration for those inspectors. * Replace inspector overrides – Removes all previous overrides and replaces them with the new content in the uploaded file.      | **Attention** | Choosing this option deletes all the previous overrides. Make an informed decision before you override the configuration using this option. |   | --- | --- |   If any error occurs while uploading the overridden inspectors, you see the error in the Upload Overridden Configuration File pop-up window. You can also download the file with the error, fix the error, and reupload the file. |
| **Step 8** | In the Upload Overridden Configuration File pop-up window, click Import to upload the overridden inspector configuration.  After you upload the overridden inspector configuration, you will see an orange icon next to the inspector that signifies that it is an overridden inspector.  Also, the Overridden Configuration column under the inspector shows the overridden value.  You can also view all the overridden inspectors using the Show Overrides Only checkbox adjacent to the Search bar.   | **Note** | Make sure that you always download the overridden configuration, open the JSON file, and append any new changes/overrides to the inspector configurations to this file. This action is needed so that you do not lose the old overridden configurations. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 9** | (Optional) Take a backup of the overridden configuration file on your system before making any new inspector configuration changes.   | **Tip** | We recommend that you take the backup from time to time as you override the inspector configuration. | | --- | --- | |

### Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 2

When you create a new network analysis policy you must give it a
unique name, specify a base policy, and choose an
*inline mode*.

The base policy defines the network analysis policy’s default
settings. Modifying a setting in the new policy overrides—but does not
change—the settings in the base policy. You can use either a system-provided or
custom policy as your base policy.

The network analysis policy’s inline mode allows preprocessors
to modify (normalize) and drop traffic to minimize the chances of attackers
evading detection. Note that in passive deployments, the system cannot affect
traffic flow regardless of the inline mode.

#### Creating a Custom Network Analysis Policy

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays policies created in the current domain, which you can edit. It also displays
policies created in ancestor domains, which you cannot edit. To view and edit policies created in a lower domain, switch to
that domain.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies.   | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Create Policy. If you have unsaved changes in another policy, click Cancel when prompted to return to the **Network Analysis Policy** page. |
| **Step 3** | Enter a unique Name.  In a multidomain deployment, policy names must be unique within the domain hierarchy. The system may identify a conflict with the name of a policy you cannot view in your current domain. |
| **Step 4** | Optionally, enter a Description. |
| **Step 5** | Choose the initial Base Policy. You can use either a system-provided or custom policy as your base policy. |
| **Step 6** | If you want to allow preprocessors to affect traffic in an inline deployment, enable Inline Mode. |
| **Step 7** | To create the policy:   * Click Create Policy to create the new policy and return to the **Network Analysis Policy** page. The new policy has the same settings as its base policy. * Click Create and Edit Policy to create the policy and open it for editing in the advanced network analysis policy editor. |

### Network Analysis Policy Management for Snort 2

On the Network Analysis Policy page (or Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies), you can view your current custom network analysis policies, along with the following information:

* the time and date the policy was last modified (in local time)
  and the user who modified it
* whether the
  Inline Mode setting is enabled, which allows
  preprocessors to affect traffic
* which access control policies and devices are using the network
  analysis policy to preprocess traffic
* whether a policy has unsaved changes, as well as information
  about who (if anyone) is currently editing the policy

In addition to custom policies that you create, the system
provides two custom policies: Initial Inline Policy and Initial Passive Policy.
These two network analysis policies use the Balanced Security and Connectivity
network analysis policy as their base. The only difference between them is
their inline mode, which allows preprocessors to affect traffic in the inline
policy and disables it in the passive policy. You can edit and use these
system-provided custom policies.

Note that you can create and edit network analysis as well as
intrusion policies if your Firepower System user account’s role is restricted
to Intrusion Policy or Modify Intrusion Policy.

#### Network Analysis Policy Settings and Cached Changes

When you create a new network analysis policy, it has the same
settings as its base policy.

When tailoring a network analysis policy, especially when
disabling preprocessors, keep in mind that some preprocessors and intrusion
rules require that traffic first be decoded or preprocessed in a certain way.
If you disable a required preprocessor, the system automatically uses it with
its current settings, although the preprocessor remains disabled in the network
analysis policy web interface.

| **Note** | ---   Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related, the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet **must** complement each other. Tailoring preprocessing, especially using multiple custom network analysis policies, is an **advanced** task.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The system caches one network analysis policy per user. While
editing a network analysis policy, if you select any menu or other path to
another page, your changes stay in the system cache even if you leave the page.

#### Editing Network Analysis Policies

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays policies created in the current domain, which you can edit. It also displays
policies created in ancestor domains, which you cannot edit. To view and edit policies created in a lower domain, switch to
that domain.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies.   | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Edit (edit icon) next to the network analysis policy you want to configure.  If View (View button) appears instead, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. |
| **Step 3** | Edit your network analysis policy:   * Change the base policy — If you want to change the base policy, choose a base policy from the Base Policy drop-down list on the Policy Information page. * Manage policy layers — If you want to manage policy layers, click Policy Layers in the navigation panel. * Modify a preprocessor — If you want to enable, disable, or edit the settings for a preprocessor, click Settings in the navigation panel. * Modify traffic — If you want to allow preprocessors to modify or drop traffic, check the  Inline Mode check box on the Policy Information page. * View settings — If you want to view the settings in the base policy, click Manage Base Policy on the Policy Information page. |
| **Step 4** | To save changes you made in this policy since the last policy commit, choose Policy Information, then click Commit Changes. If you leave the policy without committing changes, changes since the last commit are discarded if you edit a different policy. |

---

##### What to do next

* If you want a preprocessor to generate events and, in an inline deployment, drop offending packets, enable rules for the preprocessor. For more information, see [Setting Intrusion Rule States](tuning_intrusion_policies_using_rules.html#ID-2237-00000683).
* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](policy_management.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

### Preprocessor Configuration in a Network Analysis Policy for Snort 2

*Preprocessors* prepare traffic to be further inspected by
normalizing traffic and identifying protocol anomalies. Preprocessors can
generate preprocessor events when packets trigger preprocessor options that you
configure. The base policy for your network analysis policy determines which
preprocessors are enabled by default and the default configuration for each.

| **Note** | ---   In most cases, preprocessors require specific expertise to configure and typically require little or no modification. Tailoring preprocessing, especially using multiple custom network analysis policies, is an **advanced** task. Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related, the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet **must** complement each other.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Modifying a preprocessor configuration requires an understanding
of the configuration and its potential impact on your network.

Note that some advanced transport and network preprocessor
settings apply globally to all networks, zones, and VLANs where you deploy your
access control policy. You configure these advanced settings in an access
control policy rather than in a network analysis policy.

Note also that you configure the sensitive data preprocessor,
which detects sensitive data such as credit card numbers and Social Security
numbers in ASCII text, in intrusion policies.

#### Preprocessor Traffic Modification in Inline Deployments

In an inline deployment (that is, where relevant configurations
are deployed to devices using routed, switched, or transparent interfaces, or
inline interface pairs), some preprocessors can modify and block traffic. For
example:

* The inline normalization preprocessor normalizes packets to
  prepare them for analysis by other preprocessors and the intrusion rules
  engine. You can also use the preprocessor’s
  Allow These TCP Options and
  Block Unresolvable TCP Header Anomalies options to
  block certain packets.
* The system can drop packets with invalid checksums.
* The system can drop packets matching rate-based attack
  prevention settings.

For a preprocessor configured in the network analysis policy to
affect traffic, you must enable and correctly configure the preprocessor, as
well as correctly deploy managed devices inline. Finally, you must enable the
network analysis policy’s
Inline Mode setting.

#### Preprocessor Configuration in a Network Analysis Policy Notes

When you select
Settings in the navigation panel of a network
analysis policy, the policy lists its preprocessors by type. On the Settings
page, you can enable or disable preprocessors in your network analysis policy,
as well as access preprocessor configuration pages.

A preprocessor must be enabled for you to configure it. When you
enable a preprocessor, a sublink to the configuration page for the preprocessor
appears beneath the
Settings link in the navigation panel, and an
Edit link to the configuration page appears next to
the preprocessor on the Settings page.

| **Tip** | ---   To revert a preprocessor’s configuration to the settings in the base policy, click Revert to Defaults on a preprocessor configuration page. When prompted, confirm that you want to revert.   --- |
| --- | --- |

When you disable a preprocessor, the sublink and
Edit link no longer appear, but your configurations
are retained. Note that to perform their particular analysis, many
preprocessors and intrusion rules require that traffic first be decoded or
preprocessed in a certain way. If you disable a required preprocessor, the
system automatically uses it with its current settings, although the
preprocessor remains disabled in the network analysis policy web interface.

If you want to assess how your configuration would function in
an inline deployment without actually modifying traffic, you can disable inline
mode. In passive deployments or inline deployments in tap mode, the system
cannot affect traffic regardless of the inline mode setting.

| **Note** | ---   Disabling inline mode can affect intrusion event performance statistics graphs. With inline mode enabled in an inline deployment, the Intrusion Event Performance page (Overview > Summary > Intrusion Event Performance) displays graphs that represent normalized and blocked packets. If you disable inline mode, or in a passive deployment, many of the graphs display data about the traffic the system would have normalized or dropped.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   In an inline deployment, Cisco recommends that you enable inline mode and configure the inline normalization preprocessor with the Normalize TCP Payload option enabled. In a passive deployment, Cisco recommends that you use adaptive profile updates.   --- |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability is due to an integer overflow while processing Modbus traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Modbus traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort process to hang, causing traffic inspection to stop.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-dos-9D3hJLuj>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects all open source Snort project releases earlier than Release 2.9.19 and Release 3.1.11.0. For more information, see the Snort [website](https://www.snort.org/).  This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco software:    + Cyber Vision Software   + FirePOWER Services Software - All platforms   + Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software - All platforms   + Meraki MX Series Software **Note**: For FTD Software, Modbus inspection is enabled by default for the Security Over Connectivity and Max Detect Network Analysis Policies (NAP). For Cyber Vision Software and Meraki MX Series Software, Modbus inspection is enabled by default.  This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release earlier than the first fixed release of Cisco Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Snort Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software or Cisco UTD Engine for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software:    + 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + Catalyst 8000V Edge Software   + Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8500L Series Edge Platforms   + Cloud Services Routers 1000V   + Integrated Services Virtual Routers (ISRv) **Note**: UTD is not installed on these devices by default.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether UTD is Enabled To determine whether UTD is enabled on a device, issue the **show utd engine standard status** command and check for a **Yes** under **Running**. The following output shows a device with UTD enabled:  ```   Router# show utd engine standard status Engine version       : 1.0.19_SV2.9.16.1_XE17.3Profile              : Cloud-LowSystem memory        :             Usage  : 6.00 %             Status : GreenNumber of engines    : 1   ```   ```   Engine        Running    Health     Reason    ===========================================Engine(#1):   Yes        Green      None=======================================================   ...   ```  If there is no output after issuing the command, the device is not affected. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software  Details  * For the Meraki MX series devices, exploitation of this vulnerability results in the bypass of inspection services. This could result in malicious traffic not generating alerts and in turn reaching devices that are located behind the MX series device. For this reason, the Security Impact Rating (SIR) for Meraki MX devices is Medium.  For Cyber Vision, exploitation of this vulnerability results in the bypass of Snort intrusion detection (IDS) services. This could result in malicious traffic not generating alerts. Deep packet inspection (DPI) and anomaly detection services are not impacted. For this reason, the SIR for Cyber Vision software is Medium.  Workarounds  * While there are no workarounds that address this vulnerability, for FTD Software that is managed by Firepower Management Center (FMC) the Modbus preprocessor can be disabled to mitigate the attack vector for this vulnerability.  To disable a preprocessor in an FTD NAP for a device running Snort 2, see [Preprocessor Configuration in a Network Analysis Policy Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/getting_started_with_network_analysis_policies.html#ID-2245-000001d4).  To disable an inspector in an FTD NAP for a device running Snort 3, see [Custom Network Analysis Policy Creation for Snort 3](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/getting_started_with_network_analysis_policies.html#Cisco_Concept.dita_a05cb5f4-3dc2-47f2-8aa1-b928ed67a410_snort3).  For an FTD device managed by Firepower Device Manager (FDM), the device must be running Snort 3. For more information, see [Configuring the Network Analysis Policy (Snort 3)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/710/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-710/fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_49189b70-682c-4336-9620-fe104df820f6).  If you need assistance implementing this mitigation, contact the [Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC)](https://www.cisco.com/go/tac/).  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.5 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.5 |
