  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to the usage of a shared reference for a Vibrator when passed to a worker thread. The implicit capture from thread lambdas caused an issue.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect shared resource handling in multithreaded environment.",
      "Implicit capture of variables in lambdas causing concurrency issues."
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploiting the improper handling of the Vibrator shared reference when passed to a worker thread.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to trigger the specific code path where the shared vibrator is used in a worker thread, thus exploiting the improper handling of the shared reference."
