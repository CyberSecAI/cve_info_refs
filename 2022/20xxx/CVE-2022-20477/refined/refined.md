  "CVE-2022-20477": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows a malicious application to hijack tasks by using the `android:allowTaskReparenting` attribute. This can lead to UI spoofing or spying on user's activities. The vulnerability is present when `android:allowTaskReparenting` is applied and the activity's affinity is the same as the target task.",
    "root_cause": "Improper restriction on task reparenting when `android:allowTaskReparenting` is enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure task reparenting mechanism",
      "Insufficient checks on activity affinity during task reparenting"
    ],
    "impact": "UI spoofing, spying on user activities by hijacking tasks.",
    "attack_vectors": "Malicious application leveraging the `android:allowTaskReparenting` attribute.",
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious application needs to have the same affinity as the target task and the `android:allowTaskReparenting` enabled."
