Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2022-20949:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because access to HTTPS endpoints on Cisco FTD software is not properly restricted. This allows an attacker to bypass intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper access control on HTTPS endpoints within the management web server of Cisco FTD Software.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with high privileges to execute configuration commands on an affected system. This would permit the attacker to perform configuration changes on the FTD system, which should only be done through the Cisco FMC. This can lead to a privilege escalation by performing unauthorized configurations on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker sends specific messages to the vulnerable HTTPS handler.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have:
1.  Network access to the affected HTTPS management server.
2.  Credentials to authenticate with high privileges on the FTD device.
3. The ability to send crafted messages to the affected HTTPS handler from an IP address permitted by the HTTP ACL.

**Additional notes:**
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco FTD software managed by Cisco FMC and having HTTPS access enabled.
*   The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
