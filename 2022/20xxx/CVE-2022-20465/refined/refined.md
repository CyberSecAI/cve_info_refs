  "CVE-2022-20465": {
    "description": "After PUK unlock, multiple calls to KeyguardSecurityContainerController#dismiss() were being called from the KeyguardSimPukViewController, which begins the transition to the next security screen, if any. At the same time, other parts of the system, also listening to SIM events, recognize the PUK unlock and call KeyguardSecurityContainer#showSecurityScreen, which updates which security method comes next. After boot, this should be one of PIN, Password, Pattern, assuming they have a security method. If one of the first dismiss() calls comes AFTER the security method changes, this is incorrectly recognized by the code as a successful PIN/pattern/password unlock. This causes the keyguard to be marked as done, causing screen flickers and incorrect system state.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises due to a race condition where multiple calls to dismiss the keyguard occur concurrently with the system's attempt to update the next security method after a PUK unlock. This leads to the system incorrectly recognizing a successful PIN/pattern/password unlock.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Incorrect state management",
       "Improper handling of security method changes."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to screen flickering and an incorrect system state due to the keyguard being marked as 'done' prematurely.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation after SIM PUK unlock.",
    "required_capabilities": "No additional execution privileges needed. An attacker would need to perform a SIM PUK unlock on a vulnerable device."
