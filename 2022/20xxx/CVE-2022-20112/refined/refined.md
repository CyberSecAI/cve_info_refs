  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-20112",
      "root_cause": "The issue is caused by the use of `BitmapRegionDecoder` which can allocate a large amount of native heap memory during processing, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Resource exhaustion",
        "Denial of service vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "A denial-of-service vulnerability. The device can become unresponsive or crash due to the excessive memory consumption during the decoding process, which prevents normal use of the device. This is caused by `BitmapRegionDecoder` which consumes too much native heap memory during the process.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could craft a specific image that, when processed by the `BitmapRegionDecoder`, would consume a large amount of native heap memory.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to trigger the image decoding process. No special privileges are needed other than the ability to cause the system to process a crafted image using the `BitmapRegionDecoder`."
