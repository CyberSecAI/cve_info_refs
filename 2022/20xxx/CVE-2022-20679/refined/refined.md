Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-20679:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer exhaustion issue within the IPSec decryption routine of Cisco IOS XE Software. This occurs when processing traffic on a configured IPsec tunnel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Exhaustion:** The core weakness is the insufficient buffer management in the IPSec decryption process. When a device receives IPsec traffic with a large MTU, the decryption routine may attempt to write more data into the buffer than it can hold, leading to exhaustion.
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The software does not properly validate the size of the incoming packets, allowing an attacker to trigger the buffer exhaustion by sending oversized packets

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the affected device reloading, causing a denial-of-service condition. This means the device will be temporarily unavailable to process network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **IPsec Tunnel:** The attack is achieved by sending traffic to an affected device on a configured IPsec tunnel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the trusted network where the affected Cisco device resides. They must be able to send specific packets to be processed by the device.
- **MTU Support:** All network devices between the attacker and the affected device must support a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of 1800 bytes or greater.
- **IPsec Configuration:** The targeted Cisco device must have a configured IPsec VPN connection. Specifically, it must have either a crypto map configured for at least one interface or IPsec virtual tunnel interfaces (VTIs) configured. The MTU of the interface used for encryption must also be set to 1800 bytes or more.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Cisco IOS XE Software and does not affect Cisco IOS Software, IOS XR Software, Meraki products, or NX-OS Software.
*   A workaround exists: Lower the MTU to less than 1800 bytes on all IPsec-enabled interfaces. This requires corresponding MTU changes on all peers of the IPsec connection.
