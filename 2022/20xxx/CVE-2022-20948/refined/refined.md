    "summary": "The provided documents describe a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Hosted Thin Receptionist, identified as CVE-2022-20948. The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation and can be exploited by persuading a user to click a crafted link, leading to the execution of arbitrary script code or access to sensitive browser-based information.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation in the web management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Hosted Thin Receptionist.",
      "vulnerabilities": "The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface.",
      "impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted links that, when clicked by a user of the web management interface, trigger the execution of malicious scripts.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to persuade a user of the interface to click a crafted link. The attacker is assumed to be remote and authenticated. No workarounds are available, which makes exploitation potentially easier if the patch has not been applied."
