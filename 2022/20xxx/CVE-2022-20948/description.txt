A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco&nbsp;BroadWorks Hosted Thin Receptionist could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.
This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
