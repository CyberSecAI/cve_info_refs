    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-399",
      "CVSS_v3.1_Base_Score": "8.6",
      "CVSS_v3.1_Vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H",
        "Description": "A vulnerability in the RADIUS feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing RADIUS packets.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to a network or a service where the access server is using Cisco ISE as the RADIUS server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco ISE to stop processing RADIUS requests, causing authentication/authorization timeouts, which would then result in legitimate requests being denied access."

    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Improper handling of certain RADIUS requests.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of RADIUS requests"
      ],
      "Impact": "A successful exploit could cause Cisco ISE to stop processing RADIUS requests, resulting in authentication/authorization timeouts and denial of access for legitimate users.",
      "Attack Vectors": "Remote, network-based attacks.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.",
      "Affected Products": "Cisco ISE configured with RADIUS authentication services"
    },
    "Additional Information": {
      "Recovery": "A manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) is required to recover the ability to process RADIUS packets.",
      "Workarounds": "No workarounds are available.",
       "Indicators of Compromise": "RADIUS Authentication Failed\" messages in the live logs where the failure reason is due to the EAP session limit being reached.  If the Failure Reason shows \"5443 RADIUS request dropped due to reaching EAP sessions limit,\" then this vulnerability has been potentially exploited."
