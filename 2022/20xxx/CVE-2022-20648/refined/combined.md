## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed).

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Redundancy Configuration Manager -
Configuration and Administration
Guide, Release 2021.01

First  Published: January 29, 2021

Last  Updated: January  29, 2021

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
Overview

Overview

The Redundancy  Configuration Manager (RCM) is a Cisco proprietary node/network  function (NF) that provides
redundancy  of StarOS-based UP/UPFs.  The RCM provides N:M redundancy  of UP/UPFs wherein  “N” is number
of Active UP/UPFs and is less than 10, and “M” is the number of Standby UP/UPF in the redundancy group.

The RCM is developed using the Subscriber Microservices Infrastructure (SMI), a Cloud Native (CN) application.
The RCM is delivered both as VM-based and CN-based image. For 4G, the RCM VM image is collocated with
UPs and deployed as a VM. For 5G, the RCM is deployed as CN application leveraging the SMI Cluster
Manager.

For details about RCM integration with SMI Cluster Manager, refer the RCM and SMI Cluster Manager
Integration chapter.

The RCM supports the following functions:

•

Redundancy Management

o  Monitors the health of each active UP/UPF

o  Selects a standby UP/UPF  to become active when an active UP/UPF becomes unreachable
o  Stores session checkpoint information from active UPs/UPFs

o  Sends session checkpoints to new  active UP/UPF during switchover

•  Configuration  Management

o  Decides the role of a UP/UPF;  Active or Standby
o  Stores the configuration data that is sent to a UP/UPF

o  Provides the configuration data to a new UP/UPF (includes Day-0 to Day-N):

  Day-0:  Configuration required on UP/UPF with local context, management  IP, and other static

configurations other than ECS,  APN and host-specific configurations (for example, bulkstats,
thresholds, and so on.)

  Day-0.5 (RCM Context configurations): Configuration required  to connect  to UP/UPF.

Note: Day-0 and Day-0.5 configuration is outside the scope of RCM and must be configured in
UP/UPF using ESC/CM/NSO/CFP.  Contact your Cisco Account representative for more details.

o  Determines the Control Planes (CPs)/Session Management  Functions (SMFs) that register with the

UPs/UPFs.

Components

The following diagram illustrates the components of RCM.

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
Overview

The RCM comprises of the following components which runs as pods in the RCM VM:

•  Controller:  It communicates event-specific decisions with all the other pods in RCM.

•

BFD  Manager (BFDMgr):  It uses the BFD protocol to identify the state of data plane.

•  Configuration  Manager (ConfigMgr):  It loads the requested configuration to the UPs.

•

Redundancy Manager  (RedMgr): It is also called the Checkpoint Manager;  it stores and sends the
checkpoint data to a standby UP.

•  Keepalived: It communicates between  Active and Standby RCM using VRRP.

Minimum Requirements

2.  Create the cloud-locald rcm-seed image from the user_data file using the following command. The

coomand can be executed  from any local server or a jump server from where  the deployment is carried
out:

cloud-localds -H rcm rcm-seed.img user_data.yaml

Where:

o  cloud-localds: Creates a disk for cloud-init to utilize nocloud.
o  -H: Specifies the host name.
Usage/Syntax:

cloud-localds [ options ] output user-data [ meta-data ]

3.  Attach the rcm-seed.img as CDROM to the VM.

4.  After the VM is up:

a.  Ensure  the hostname of RCM VM is added to /etc/hosts

For example:  127.0.1.1 rcm rcm
Where  rcm is the hostname.

b.  Ensure  that the kubeadm_init, kubelet, calico_init, helm, and init_cluster services are running.  You can

verify by executing the following command:

systemctl status kubelet/helm/init_cluster/calico_init

NOTE: Allow additional time (approximately 15 minutes) for Ops Center  to come up on first boot. The extra time
is required for the system startup to run  certain hardening scripts that makes the system more secure.

You can  check the following system service status. Excluding kubelet and helm,  for which the status will display
as Active (Running),  status for all other services will display as Active (Exited):

o  systemctl status kubelet

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
Overview

o  systemctl status kubeadm_init
o  systemctl status calico_init
o  systemctl status hardening
o  systemctl status helm
o  systemctl status init_cluster

The Ops Center pods comes up after the status of all the services are Active.

c.  For kubectl commands to work for a non-root user, please execute  the following (this example assumes

the user is called "luser"):

mkdir ~luser/.kube

sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ~luser/.kube/config

sudo chown luser:luser ~luser/.kube/config

d.  Setup the helm using:

helm init --client-only --kubeconfig /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf --
stable-repo-url http://10.42.1.1:9000

NOTE: The “http://10.42.1.1” is the location of docker images for RCM which is used by Helm. It is a local
URL inside the VM.

e.  RCM ops-center pods can be seen  in the RCM namespace:

kubectl get pods -n rcm

f.  Configure the UP username  and password, in Ops Center,  that are passed to ConfigMgr. For details, see

Configuring UPF Credentials section.

NOTE: Without configuring the UPF credentials, the ConfigMgr pod will not be in running state.

5.  Configure the Ops Center  to bring up the RCM component pods:

a.  Get ops-center pod name by executing below command

kubectl get pods -n rcm_namespace | grep ops-center

b.  Reset the password of the Ops Center using the following command:

kubectl exec -ti ops_center_pod reset-admin -n rcm
For example:  kubectl exec -ti ops-center-rcm-ops-center-d6d9cf976-jmght
reset-admin -n rcm

c.  Access the Ops Center  using the password created in Step 5b.

d.  Access the Ops Center  CLI using ops-center service IP:

kubectl get svc -n rcm
ssh -p 2024 admin@svc_ip
For example: ops-center-rcm-ops-center ClusterIP 10.43.213.124<none>
8008/TCP,8080/TCP,2024/TCP,2022/TCP,7681/TCP 39h

6.  After Ops Center CLI is configured, run RCM components using the following command in Global

Configuration mode:

system mode running
To remove RCM components: system mode shutdown

RCM Deployment Architecture

The following diagram illustrates a typical RCM deployment model.

It is co-located with all the UPs it manages;  RCM can manage multiple independent UP groups.

Note that the  UP groups in 1:1 redundancy  mode is through ICSR and are not controlled by RCM.

It has a high-performance  network between  itself and its UPs (SR-IOV or equivalent). Same  is the case
with Keepalive (VRRP) network between  RCM HA instances.

It monitors its UPs for failures and initiates failover to a standby UP.

It quickly detects a UP failure using the multi-hop BFD protocol.

It pre-configures (excluding CP and UPs Day-0 and Day-0.5 configuration as they are part of RCM)
standby UPs with all the active host-specific configuration.

Its user interface (UI) displays the state or health of a UP, stats, historical events (logs), and triggers a
manual failover. In addition to monitoring, the UI supports the addition and removal of UPs and/or UP
groups.

If an RCM is configured without a redundant  RCM, then the UPs under its control continue  to run and
provide services (not redundantly).

If RCM restarts and connects to UPs, then the RCM re-learns  or audit state from the existing UPs without
disrupting services.

How it Works

This section describes how the RCM functions work:

•

Redundancy  Management

•  Configuration Management

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

Redundancy Management

N:M redundancy  using RCM, where  N > 1 and M is at least 1, is a mechanism  that is required to store all the
required information at a common location. This common information is properly segregated based on “N” User
Planes (UPs)/User Plane Functions (UPFs), and each UP/UPF  contains “x” Session Managers (SessMgrs). On a
switchover trigger, one of the “M” UPs/UPFs available as standby is selected to receive the appropriate data
from the common location. This functionality is achieved  through RCM.

To support N:M UP redundancy,  the RCM provides the following functionality:

•

Procedure  to acquire the dynamic configuration based on the configuration changes.  The Configuration
Manager performs this procedure and pushes the configuration according to the state of the UP (active or
standby).

•  Method to store and retrieve the checkpoint data. It stores the checkpoint data because  the exact standby

for each active UP is not pre-allocated. When an active UP fail, the Redundancy  Manager (RedMgr) pods
send the stored checkpoint data to the newly selected UP from the available pool of standby UPs.

•  Mechanism to detect the failure of a UP. A Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Manager  (BFDMgr)

pod monitors the UP/UPFs and detects failures.

•

Enables the RCM Controller pod to take decisions and instruct the other pods depending on the UP
discovery or failure. Based on number of events, the Controller also controls the actions of the three
managers: Configuration Manager,  Redundancy  Manager,  and BFD Manager.

•  Maintain information about the IP pool.

Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the logical network layout for a single VM RCM.

The RCM node is built on Subscriber Management  Infrastructure (SMI). SMI provides the Kubernetes  (K8s)
infrastructure, which is used to bring all the required pods to support the redundancy  for UPs.

The Ubuntu cloud image supports cloud-init based configuration (https://cloud-init.io). You must use cloud-init
to configure local user accounts (ssh key or password-based) and network configuration.

RCM services (rcm-controller, ConfigMgr, RedMgr) are prepopulated in the disk image. An RCM-specific Ops
Center  provides the user interface to RCM. The RCM services are started on bootup and monitored via K8s
liveliness.

8

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

In RCM, the VM requires multiple network interfaces. One interface for "management" connectivity (Ubuntu
SSH daemon and Ops Center  access), and another interface is for "service" connectivity (session state over
this interface). The "management" interface has low throughput requirement  and so, paravirtual NICs can be
used. The "service" interface needs to be high speed and so, a SRIOV type interface  is required.  One optional
"VNFM" interface can  be used as pingable interface for ESC. Cloud-init is used to configure these NICs. Cloud-
init configuration and NIC naming can vary depending on the environment

For deployment information, refer RCM Deployment section.

Redundancy with Cloud Native

The N:M redundancy  with Cloud Native support involves:

•  A procedure  to acquire the dynamic configuration based on the configuration changes.

This is performed by the ConfigMgr. It pushes the configuration according to the state of the UP (Active or
Standby).

•  A way to store and retrieve the checkpoint data. It stores the data as the exact Standby for each  Active is
not pre-allocated. On Active failure, the checkpoint data is pushed to the newly-selected  Active from the
available pool of Standby.

This is performed by the RedMgr (CheckPointMgr) pods.

•  A mechanism to detect the failure of UP. A BFDMgr pod monitors all the UPs and detects failure.

•  A Controller pod determines and instructs action mechanism  to other pods based on UP discovery and

failure. Controller also controls the actions of all the three managers on several events.

Upgrade Process

All the required RCM images are bundled as offline tar images and can  be downloaded from the software
repository. You can perform the rolling upgrades through Common Execution Environment (CEE)  Ops Center.

For details, refer the Upgrading CEE  Products section in the UCC SMI Common Execution  Environment
Configuration and Administration Guide.

For VM-based application, rolling upgrade of components is currently not supported. Any updates to Ubuntu
packages or RCM components are delivered through a new disk image. You must delete the current RCM
instance, spawn a new RCM instance based on the new disk image, and then configure the new instance.

For upgrade/downgrade  of RCM in HA, see RCM Upgrade and Downgrade Procedure in HA.

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

N:M Redundancy Architecture

In 4G networks, UPs and CPs communicate over the Sx interface. In 5G, the UPFs and SMFs communicate over
N4 interface.  The UP is user plane which could be a PGW-U, SGW-U,  SAEGW-U, or UP(F). A group of UPs that
are deployed to support the same configuration are  said to be a part of same UP group (UPG). Therefore,  for an
N:M redundancy  configuration, the UP group is comprised of (N+M) UPs that are of the same capacity and
capability.

The UP transfers the checkpoint data to Redundancy  Manager  pods on the RCM. These pods receive  the
checkpoint data, store them, and segregate them properly so that each  checkpoint is retrieved or modified
properly. The  checkpoint data reuses the same mechanism  of Service  Redundancy  Protocol (SRP) on the UP to
transfer the  data to achieve the redundancy.

During switchover, the RCM Controller indicates to all the Redundancy  Manager  pods to push the data of the
failed UP to a new UP. First, the Controller pushes the pool-chunk information to the newly selected UP.
Secondly,  the call records for all the subscribers are pushed to the corresponding Session Managers. Lastly,
the Controller itself pushes the route modifier and IP pool information to the new UP. On receiving all the
required data, the new  UP becomes active and services new  calls along with the existing calls.

To ensure  faster data retrieval, it’s stored in memory. The checkpoint data that the Redundancy  Manager
receives is stored in the RAM. After careful segregation based on UP, session, and call, the checkpoint data is
pushed to the new active UP after a switchover from the RAM.

The BFD Manager detects the failure of a UP and informs the controller about the failure.  Then, the Controller
selects a new UP from the available pool of ‘m’ standby. The Controller also instructs all the Redundancy
Managers to transfer the checkpoint data to the new active UP. It also handles the synchronization of data from
various Redundancy  Managers to the new UP.

The RCM supports multiple UP groups and segregates based on the UP group. If there is any failure
notification, the Controller also identifies the UP. The Session Manager of the UP connects and stores the

10

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

checkpoint data in the same Redundancy  Manager pod. To achieve  this result, the Redundancy  Manager pod
maintains the same IP and port even after a pod reboot.

UP Registration Call Flow

The following call flow illustrates the registration of UP.

Operational Flow

Boot-up Sequence of Pods

On configuring redundancy,  the Subscriber Microservices Infrastructure (SMI) brings up the following pods (not
in any particular order):

•  Configuration Manager Pod

•

•

Redundancy  Manager  Pods: These are a set of Redundancy  Managers based on the UP group and number
of Sessions Managers tasks that need support. Ideally this indicates the number of Session Managers tasks
in each  UP.

BFD Manager Pod: This is a UP/UPF monitoring pod that monitors all the available UP/UPFs in a
redundancy  group.

•  Controller Pod: This pod also comes up about the same time as all other pods.

11

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

Meanwhile,  each  UP comes up independently.  Only the endpoint address of the RCM is configured for each
UP.

When each  pod comes up, the Controller is notified about the existence of each  pod. The Configuration
Manager indicates to the Controller about its presence.  The Configuration Manager  also indicates the readiness
to push the configuration, on UP registration. When the Redundancy  Manager  pods come up, their presence  is
notified to the Controller. The Controller establishes a communication mechanism  with all the Redundancy
Manager pods. After the UP starts sending the checkpoint information to each  Redundancy  Manager,  it updates
the Controller about the hosting of the checkpoint data and the Session Manager instance.  The BFD Manager
also establishes the connection with the Controller and exchanges  a handshake  with the Controller.

UP Bootup Sequence

The following is the UP bootup sequence  when the RCM is used:

1.  The UP sends Init state to the RCM Controller.

2.  The RCM Controller determines to make it Active or Standby and sets the state as PendActive or

PendStandby in its data structures (The PendStandby is not available for switchover selection).

3.  The RCM Controller sends State (Active or Standby), Host ID (Host string), and Route Modifier to the UP.

4.  The UP responds to the RCM Controller acknowledging the State and Host ID.

5.  The UP stores or updates its State and Host ID in Shared/System  Configuration Task (SCT).

SCT is a StarOS task for configuring system parameters, retrieving information, and notifying system
components of configuration changes.

6.  The RCM Controller sends the UP’s Endpoint, State, and Host ID notification to its Configuration Manager

service.

7.  The RCM Controller also sends the UP’s Endpoint and State to its Redundancy  Manager service.

8.  The RCM Configuration Manager  pushes the Active or Standby configuration to the UP.

9.  The UP stores the “Config Pushed” flag in its SCT (vpnmgr) subsystem.

10.  The UP sends a “Config Push Complete” notification to the RCM Controller through vpnmgr.

11.  The RCM Controller marks PendActive or PendStandby as full Active or Standby. (The Standby state is now

available for switchover).

12.  The RCM Controller sends the “Config Push Complete” message its Configuration Manager service for

reconfirmation.

UP Switchover Sequence

The following is the UP switchover sequence  when  the RCM is used:

1.  The RCM Controller detects the failure of the UP.

2.  The RCM Controller changes the mapping of UP’s Endpoint to Host ID, and assigns the failed active UP’s

Host ID to a new active UP that was selected from the Standby list.

3.  The RCM Controller notifies its Configuration Manager service about switchover notification.

4.  The RCM Configuration Manager  activates the host-config of old active (by negating others), and changes

the mapping of Host ID to new active UP.

5.  The RCM Controller pushes the IP pool checkpoints to the new Active UP.

12

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

6.  The RCM Controller notifies the Redundancy  Manager service to push all the checkpoint data.

7.  The RCM Controller sends State (Active) and Host ID to new Active UP.

8.  The new Active UP receives the negate  of config and control group association.

9.  The new Active UP notifies the RCM Controller about the “Config Push Complete”.

10.  The RCM Controller receives the “Config Pushed” flag from new  Active and updates its data with State,

Host ID, and pushed flag.

11.  The RCM Controller notifies the Configuration Manager  service about the “Config Push Complete” for

validation.

RCM Controller Restart

Upon RCM Controller restart, the UP will detect connection failure and they will reattempt. Once RCM Controller
is back, the UP will reconnect.  The UPs that are in new state may have to wait for approximately five minutes
before successful registration.

VPNMgr Restart

Upon restart of the UP’s VPNMgr, the VPNMgr reconnects with RCM Controller and ensures that both are in
sync.

Switchover and Recovery

Pl anned Switchover

Planned switchovers can be done in the following ways:

•  When a UP is manually rebooted/reloaded during a maintenance  window wherein  the UP indicates to the

RCM about the event of going down.

•  When switchover is triggered from the RCM by either the Controller, Configmgr, or BFDMgr using the CLI.

For information about the CLI command, refer the Performing Planned Switchover section.

The following images illustrate the call flows for planned switchover.

How it Works

14

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

Unplanned Switchover

Unplanned  switchovers occur due to issues in the UP and it gets rebooted without manual intervention. When
unplanned  switchover happens,  the BFD monitor Pod detects that the  UP has gone down and triggers the RCM
Controller to start switchover mechanism.  The RCM controller chooses a Standby UP and the Redundancy
Manager Pods to start pushing configuration and checkpoints to the new  UP.

The following image illustrates the call flow for an unplanned  switchover.

15

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

Failover  Time  Optimization for Unplanned Switchover

The minimum time taken by the new UP to become Active and process traffic is determined  by the following
factors:

•

Failure detection of the Active UP

•  Configuration/IP Pool Flush from RCM

•  Checkpoints Flush from RCM

•  Active State transition and Route Convergence

As part of this functionality, a new CLI command (switchover allow-checkpoint-processing-
active) is introduced that allows Active state to be pushed immediately after the “Config Push Complete”,
and checkpoints are processed even after the chassis moves into Active state. This results in reducing the
overall Failover time.

NOTE:

•

•

If the “Config Pushed” time is more than the “Checkpoint Flush” time, this optimization will not yield the
expected Failover time reduction.

Failure Detection time optimization is currently not supported.

16

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
How it Works

For information about the CLI command, refer the Configuring Failover Time Optimization for Unplanned
Switchover section.

Configuration Management

Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) module is required irrespective of whether  redundancy  is enabled or not. It
is responsible to load the requested configuration for UPF. The functionality involves:

•  On successful registration of UP with the RCM,  the Controller provides the Management  IP of the UP. For

details, see UP Registration Call Flow.

•  ConfigMgr receives  the information of all Management  IPs from the Controller.

•  ConfigMgr pushes the UP Day-1 configuration to UP through SSH connection.

•  Configmgr communicates with Controller over the gRPC link and exchanges  the information.

The following figure depicts how the configuration works when RCM is used.

The ConfigMgr Pod is used to take the user input (configuration) from the Ops Center CLI and convert it into
the corresponding StarOS CLI. The converted CLI is then pushed to the registered UP/UPF over SSH.

NOTE: The ConfigMgr Pod comes up only after the required  CLI commands are configured in the Ops Center.
Similarly, the UP/UPF  node must have  the appropriate CLI commands configured for it to connect to the
ConfigMgr Pod. In the absence  of the CLI commands, the UP/UPF node will not attempt to connect to the
ConfigMgr for registration.

The following is the sequence  of distributing UP/UPF-specific configuration to all the registered UP/UPFs.

1.  The required configuration is applied in the Ops Center  to bring up the ConfigMgr Pod. For details, see  the

Configuring the ConfigMgr Pod section.

2.  The policy-charging related configuration is applied to generate  the respective configuration maps. This is

required for the ConfigMgr Pod to come up.

3.  The UP/UPF node is configured with the required  CLI commands to start the registration process with the

ConfigMgr. For details, see Configuring UP with Day-0 Configuration section.

17

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01

4.  On successful registration, the UP/UPF receives the configured CLIs (configured as part of Step 2) over

SSH.

Configuring the RCM

•  node-name node_name: Specifies the node name  of the UP to send the Configuration Manager

endpoint. node_name is the UP node name.

•  peer bfd_peer_ip_address: The bfd_peer_ip_address must already be configured as a

multihop BFD peer  session with RCM BFD Manager  pod in the context context_name.
bfd_peer_ip_address IP address can  be different from the RCM Controller Pod IP address.

•  group group_number: [Optional] Configure to track multiple BGP peers under same monitor group.

group_number must be in the range  of 1 through 10.

If group is not specified, monitor will act as an individual monitor.
If previously configured, use no monitor bgp context context_name peer-ip CLI command to
remove the BGP monitor in RCM.

UP/UPF informs RCM to trigger UP/UPF switchover under  following scenarios:

o  When a monitor, configured without group number,  fails.
o  When all the monitors, configured under  single group number, fails.

•  peer bfd_ip_address: The bfd_ip_address should already be configured as a multi-hop BFD
peer session with RCM Bfdmgr pod in context context_name. This IP address can be different than
the RCM Controller Pod IP address.
If previously configured, use no monitor bfd peer bfd_ip_address CLI command to remove the
BFD monitor in RCM.

Configuring BFD monitor in RCM provide the following functionality:

o  Switchover Scenario 1: The UP/UPF tears down TCP connection with RCM controller if BFD monitor

goes down. It waits for both BFD monitor with RCM BFDMgr and TCP connection with RCM Controller
to come up per configured CLI.

o  Switchover Scenario 2: If UP/UPF  is not in Init state and receives Init state from Controller, the UP/UPF

reboots itself.

At initial boot time, UP/UPF does not initiate TCP connection with RCM Controller if BFD monitor is down.

•  switchover allow-early-active-transition: Allows early transition to active during

switchover. Traffic is processed along with the pre-allocation of other calls.

•  store-checkpoint { enable | disable }: Enable  or disable storing of checkpoints until the end

of checkpoint flushing from RCM.

•  enable: Enable storing of checkpoints and defer call pre-allocation until end of flushing.
•  disable: Disable storing of checkpoints and allow call pre-allocation during flushing.
•  bfd multihop-peer: Specifies the time interval within which RCM must detect failure by using a

protocol such as multi-hop BFD.

•  reload_interval_seconds: Specifies the time interval, zero (0) seconds to 30 days (in seconds), for

chassis reload after BFD with RCM goes down. Default is no reload.

•  switchover allow-checkpoint-processing-active { true | false }:

o  When set to true, RCM does not wait for the completion of checkpoint flush before sending Active

state and lower Route Modifier to new Active UP.

o  When set to false, RCM waits for the completion of checkpoint flush before sending Active state and

lower Route Modifier to new Active UP.

o  By default, the CLI command is set to false.

NOTES:

•

By default, the configuration is disabled.

•  When this CLI command is configured under RCM context in UP, it accepts and processes checkpoints in
Active state. This is done only for the Unplanned  switchover initiated by the RCM. The checkpoints are

RCM High Availability

Feature Description

The Redundancy  and Configuration Management (RCM) provides a High Availability (HA) solution for User
Planes (UPs). RCM enables support for N:M redundancy  which minimizes the number of redundant data UPs
required for your deployment. To prevent UP session loss resulting from unplanned  RCM outages, the RCM can
be deployed in HA mode.

Architecture

RCM HA is achieved by deploying two instances of the RCM. The RCM instances run in active and standby
mode. The external IPs for each instance are configured as Virtual IPs (VIP addresses) each  running the Virtual
Router Redundancy  Protocol (VRRP).

Depending on the Primary RCM node (e.g. the Primary VRRP),  one of the RCM instances assumes the active
role and the other RCM instance assumes the Standby role.

When the active RCM is unavailable, then  the VRRP selects the standby RCM as Primary and this instance
becomes the new active RCM. The  UP automatically connects to the new RCM (as the IP address moves to
new RCM). All UPs connected  to the previously active RCM experience  connection resets and, upon retry, they
get connected  to the new RCM.

The following image illustrates the RCM HA architecture.

29

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM High Availability

RCM HA deployments require the installation of two RCM instances instead of one. To achieve high-speed
communication between  the UPs and RCM, and to ensure  that the UP switchover time is as minimal as
possible, both RCM should be deployed in the same datacenter as the UPs for which  they are providing
redundancy.

How it Works

RCM HA support is based on VRRP.  VRRP dynamically determines which RCM instance serves as the Primary
(active) or standby (Backup) based on the assignment of the default route address.

VRRP selects the RCM instance  that receives the IP address based on several factors, such as the host priority,
first to be active, instance interface state (for example, “Up”), and so on. VRRP  provides many options for
customizing the rules for determining the Primary and Backup role for the RCM instance.

The RCM architecture is based on UP-to–RCM communication using UDP (BFD) and TCP (Controller,
Checkpoint Manager) connections. The UPs are configured with BFD, Controller, and CheckpointMgr IP
addresses. The UPs use these IP addresses to communicate with the RCM.

When the RCMs are deployed with HA, BFD, Controller, and Checkpoint IP addresses are configured as one IP
address. This IP address, also known as external IP address, is then configured as a VIP in RCM. The VIP is
managed by VRRP  which determines the RCM that owns the VIP. All UPs use VIP address to communicate with
the RCM. The RCM instance which owns the VIP becomes active and the other RCM instance becomes
Standby.

When the active RCM reboots or relinquishes its Primary role, the VIP moves to the standby instance  resulting
in the standby RCM becoming active and the UPs reconnecting  to newly active RCM.

The RCM’s Controller Pod learns the state of the  UPs and communicates the same to the Configmgr. The
Controller Pod ensures consistency of operation and decides when/if to reboot a UP to restore the system to a
healthy state. UP reboots are reserved  for rare,  corner case scenarios.

For double-fault scenarios, (for example,  when  the switchover process is left in hung state and UP reboots
itself after detecting it’s in hung  state), the Controller sends a START_SWITCHOVER message to the UP and
starts the rest of switchover process after getting an Ack from UP.

Keepalived

Keepalived is a software implementation of VRRP on Linux that runs as a pod on the RCM VM. VRRP uses the
concept of a VIP. One or more hosts (routers, servers, and so on) participates in an election to determine the
host that will control the VIP. Only one host (Primary) controls the VIP at a time. If the Primary host fails, the
VRRP provides mechanisms for detecting that failure and quickly failing over to a Standby host.

The following flow diagram illustrates how RCM achieves  HA using Keepalived.

30

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM High Availability

After the Keepalived pod is up and running on both the VMs, one of the RCM VMs comes up as Primary and
another as Backup.  Keepalived leverages the following files for proper operation:

1.  keeplived.conf—This is the Keeplalived service configuration file. It contains various Keepalived keywords

to tune the service and to track VRRP  (using track_file and track_script options) and notify script
(keepalived_notify.sh) to run when  VRRP instance changes  the State. VIP details are part of the
configuration applied through the RCM Ops Center.

2.  keepalived_notify.sh—This  is specified using the notify_script keyword mentioned in keepalived.conf file.
This script takes actions when the RCM VM changes  any state. For example, it specifies what action must
be taken when the RCM VM transitions from Primary to a Fault State.

Both keepalived.conf and keepalived_notify.sh are a part of the Keepalived container inside the Keepalived
pod. Keepalived also tracks a file using track_file option to keep a check on overall system health.  When BFD
detects all UPs are down, the RCM controller notifies Keepalived through track_file, the RCM is then deemed
unhealthy  using keepalived mechanism, and an RCM switchover occurs.

There  is a possibility for events other than what is explicitly specified as part of track_file to occur (such as, VM
reboot, interface going down, and so on). During such unspecified events,  an RCM switchover event  is
triggered.

31

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM High Availability

The following figure illustrates the States that the VRRP instance in RCM VM can transition to.

After the Keepalived pod is up and running,  one of the RCM VM instances comes up as Primary and the other
as Backup.  When Keepalived health monitoring fails on Primary, it transitions to Fault state first and then  to
Backup state. At the same time, Backup  transitions to Primary role. Whenever  the state transitions to Fault
state, the VM is rebooted. This action is done by keepalived_notify script.

RCM  Upgrade and Downgrade Procedure in HA

In the old RCM VM:

•

•

Take a backup of the running configuration.

Take a backup of the configuration folders—master, host, svc-type—from /var/rcm/scripts/config

In the new  RCM VM:

To upgrade the RCM image in case of qcow2, delete the old vol-image, create a new image, and restart the
VM.

•  Configure the back-up ops-center configuration

•  Copy the backed-up contents of master/host/svc-type folders to their respective folders

•

Perform system mode running

Prerequisites and Assumptions

RCM HA operation is based on the following prerequisites/assumptions:

•

•

•

The Operator must reconfigure any delta configurations that was done on one RCM while the other RCM
was in rebooting state.

The Operator must configure both RCM instances in an identical way for updates.

The Operator need  not track which RCM instance is Active and which one is Standby.

•  Only one VIP is configured per RCM.  This VIP serves as IP for Controller, BFD,  and Checkpoint Manager.

•  All VRRP requirements,  as specified in RFC3768, are needed  to implement RCM HA solution. It includes:

32

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM High Availability

o  The interface on which the VIP is defined for both RCM instances are part of same L2 domain.

o  The L2 switch to which the VIP interfaces are connected are  multicast enabled.

The UP is configured with five minutes BFD timeout by default. If the UP does not find RCM within the
timeout period, the UP gets rebooted.

The VRRP protocol ensures  that RCM does not end up in active-active state. RCM Backup-Backup  state is
possible if both VIP interfaces are down.

•

•

•  A new  or rebooted UP may have  to wait up to five minutes before getting registered with the RCM. This is

expected during initial RCM bring-up and during RCM switchover.

•

RCM HA does not support hot-standby wherein  checkpoints are synchronized between  RCM instances.
RCM HA supports cold-standby. That is, upon switchover, new  RCM re-learns checkpoints from the UPs.

RCM HA deployments do not assume the availability of external persistent storage.

Operational Flow

This section describes the scenarios and operation of RCM HA solution.

RCM HA Deployment

The following points describe the operational flow within RCM HA deployments:

1.  The Operator brings up the RCM VMs and applies the required configurations (common and host-specific).

NOTE: The Operator reconfigures the RCM whenever  it reboots.

2.  One of the RCM VMs becomes active because the VRRP  selects that RCM instance as Primary for the

following reasons:

o  The RCM instance that comes up first becomes the Primary (provided VIP interface is up) and the other

RCM that comes up later becomes Backup, OR

o

If both RCM instances come up simultaneously, then  the VRRP uses a tie-breaker algorithm to select
one of the RCM instances to be the Primary.

3.  The active RCM starts receiving connection  requests (e.g.  BFD messages, Controller Request,  etc.) from

the UPs.

4.  All UPs start registering with the active RCM.

5.  After registration is complete, the active RCM starts assigning active/standby roles to the UPs and

configures them based on their role.

6.  Active UPs start the checkpoint operation with the active RCM, and the active RCM starts managing the

standby UPs.

7.  When the active RCM crashes  or relinquishes its role as Primary, the Backup RCM becomes active. The old

active RCM either reboots or restarts the Controller Pod.

Should an RCM switchover occur,  the UP detects a BFD failure and brings down the TCP connection with
the Controller and Checkpoint Manager.

NOTE: The RCM switchover is triggered by moving the VIP. For UPs, the switchover is merely detected as
connection failure and UPs retry the connection.

8.  The UPs initiate BFD sessions with the newly active RCM and re-establish the controller TCP connection

with it.

9.  The UPs share information with the newly active RCM:

33

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM High Availability

o  Their role (for example,  Active or Standby)

o  The host-ID allocated to it (in case it was active)
o  Their configuration state (for example, whether  a UP received  the configuration or not)

10.  The newly active RCM builds the state information with the information supplied by the UPs.

11.  The newly active RCM resumes operation based on state information:

o  For active UPs, the it starts a full checkpoint operation.
o  For registering UPs, it determines the role and host configuration.

o  For UPs that did not receive the full configuration, it reconfigures the UP and it determines the role for

new RCM.

RCM Switchover During UPs Registration/Configuration

While UP registration/Day-1 configuration is in progress, one or more of State, Host ID, and “Config Pushed”
flag might not be updated on the UP. As such, the UP publishes the saved State, Host ID, and “Config Pushed”
flag to the new  Active RCM:

•

•

•

•

•

If the State is Active, the Host ID is not null, and the Pushed  flag is true —> The RCM Controller accepts the
information and updates the Database. It notifies the Configuration Manager service with this information
and the Redundancy  Manager about the state.

If the State is active, the Host ID is not null, and the Pushed flag is false —> The RCM Controller accepts the
State of the UP and informs the Configuration Manager  to push the configuration again.

If the State is Active and the Host ID is null —> The RCM Controller informs the UP to reboot.

If the State is Standby and the Pushed  flag is true —> The RCM Controller accepts the information and
updates the database. (For Standby, the Host ID is ignored, and the Standby cannot represent  an Active
host configuration.) It then  notifies the Configuration Manager  and the Redundancy  Manager about the
State.

If the State is Standby and the Pushed  flag is false —> The RCM Controller either informs the Configuration
Manager to push the configuration to the UP again or reboots the UP.

RCM Switchover During UP Switchover

1.  Active UP failure is detected but switchover is not initiated: This is a scenario wherein  the Active RCM

detects the UP failure, however, before the UP switchover can be initiated, the Active RCM fails. In such
scenarios, the new Active RCM receives Init request from the  failed UP (after it reboots), and the new
Active RCM assigns the appropriate role.

NOTE: Loss of sessions are expected  in this scenario as the failed UP could not be switched over to
standby UP.

2.  Active UP failure is detected, and switchover is initiated: This is a scenario wherein  the Active RCM detects
the UP failure and it starts the switchover. However, Active RCM fails before switchover is complete. In
such scenarios, the new Active RCM receives Init request from failed UP (after it reboots), and the new
Active RCM assigns the appropriate role to the UP. However, the standby UP which received  partial
checkpoints eventually detects that it’s in hung state and so, it reboots. Upon completion of reboot, it
registers with new  Active RCM and the new Active RCM assigns appropriate role to the UP.

NOTE: Total loss of sessions is expected for the failed UP as switchover is not completed.

RCM High Availability

RCM Switchover During Provisioning of UP

Scaling up and scaling down of UPs is not supported for RCM.

RCM Switchover During Decommissioning of UP

Scaling up and scaling down of UPs is not supported for RCM.

Reboot of both RCMs

When both the RCMs are unavailable, the BFD restart timers on the UPs reset to a value such that UPs can
continue serving until one of the RCMs is available.

RCM Switchover during Loss of Connectivity to Active UP

The Active UP loses connectivity to the RCM before the RCM switchover, the UP switchover completes, and
the old Active UP reconnects  to new  Active RCM. The new Active UP and old Active UP have the same Host ID.
The new Active RCM chooses to keep the UP with lower Route Modifier as Active and reboots the UP with
higher Route Modifier.

RCM Switchover during Route Modifier Wraparound

If an Active UP registration is received  with lowest Route Modifier, the RCM waits for five minutes (UP self-
reboot time):

•

•

If the time period is exceeded,  the Route Modifier is wrapped around.

If within the time period, another Active UP registration is received with same Host ID (but with higher
Route Modifier), then the reboot is performed on the UP with the higher Route Modifier. The Route Modifier
wraparound procedure is then started for the lowest Route Modifier UP.

Limitations

UP switchover is not supported within five minutes of RCMs switchover. If there  is any switchover within this
time, it is considered as double-failure and Session Recovery  is not possible.

RCM IPSec

Feature Description

Security is very crucial aspect of any solution that meets vital customer requirements  on security-related
issues. RCM provides a secure  computing environment and is part of a stable solution. RCM addresses both
internal and external security aspects by protecting traffic between  RCM and UP using IP Security (IPSec).

IPSec is a suite of protocols that interact with one another to provide secure private communications across IP
networks. These protocols allow the system to establish and maintain secure  tunnels with peer security
gateways. IPSec provides confidentiality, data integrity, access control, and data source authentication to IP
datagrams.

Architecture

The following diagram depicts the overall architecture  of the RCM IPSec  solution.

There  is one IPSec  (L3) tunnel between  RCM and each  UP. This node-level L3 tunnel between  RCM and UP
guarantees  full protection of information exchanged  between  RCM and UP.

At a high-level, the RCM IPSec  solution provides the following functionality:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

RCM supports multiple IPSec  tunnels.

RCM functions with or without IPSec.

RCM supports OpsCenter CLI using which IPSec can be enabled  and IPSec-related  information can be
configured.

Show CLI commands display details of the IPSec tunnel  and IPSec  data exchanged.

RCM generates SNMP traps when  the tunnel is established, released,  re-established, and so on.

Supports configuration of strongSwan with a static routing table.

RCM HA supports reestablishment of UP with IPSec tunnel  during switchover scenario.

How it Works

A single IPSec  tunnel is established between  RCM and UP. This tunnel carries checkpoint traffic, configuration
files, VPNMGR traffic towards RCM, and so on. Since configuration from RCM uses SSH, there is no need to
use IPSec for SSH traffic.

To support IPSec  operation, the following pod is introduced:

•

strongSwan:  Establishes the IPSec tunnel (that is, the Control Plane of IPSec)

The strongSwan runs as a pod with Host mode networking and as a Deamon process. When  you enable  the
IPSec using OpsCenter, then strongSwan pod gets created.  IPSec tunnel initiation always happens from UP.
The strongSwan handles the IPSec tunnel creation aspect. And, once the IPsec tunnel parameters are
determined, it configures the host kernel  for the IPSec data plane. The host kernel performs the
encryption/decryption of IPSec  traffic. When  host kernel receives the encrypted packet, it decrypts the packet
and punts it to the application listening on specific IPs. The strongSwan maintains the tunnel state between  the
RCM and the UP.

RCM IPSec

The following illustration depicts the system architecture of RCM VM.

When RCM is deployed on bare metal, the RCM VM layer does not exist, and packet flow involves host kernel.

NOTE: Additional hardware for RCM is required  as few cores must be dedicated for strongSwan.

RCM  IPSec Tunnel Establishment

The following illustration depicts how IPSec tunnel is established between  RCM and UP, and the packet flow.

The following steps explain how IPSec tunnel is established between  RCM and UP:

39

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM IPSec

3.  UP initiates IPSec tunnel establishment using IPSec control protocol such as IKEV1 or IKEV2. You may opt

to choose only IKEV2.

4.  Host kernel  receives the packet.

5.  The host kernel sends the packet to strongSwan.

The above steps are repeated  between  UP and RCM till IPSec tunnel establishment concludes.

6.  After the tunnel is established, strongSwan configures the host kernel  with IPSec data plane parameters.

7.  Host kernel  is now ready to encrypt/decrypt IPSec  packet towards the UP, and strongSwan is ready to

maintain the IPSec  tunnels between host kernel  and UP.

NOTE: Above sequence  of operation is executed  whenever  UP establishes an IPSec tunnel.

Checkpoint Data Transfer

The following illustration depicts the checkpoint data transfer and packet flow.

The following steps explain the sequence  of checkpoint data transfer and packet flow:

8.  SessMgr of UP sends checkpoint over IPSec  tunnel (note that all packet between  RCM and UP uses the

same tunnel, and there is one tunnel between  UP and RCM).

9.  Host kernel  receives the packet and decrypts it.

10.  The host kernel sends the packet to desired checkpoint manager  (essentially, this happens  through

Kubernetes  networking).

11.  Checkpoint manager processes the packet and generates a response (for example,  TCP ACK).

12.  The response packet is sent to the host kernel.

13.  Host kernel  encrypts and egresses the packet.

14.  The strongSwan maintains the tunnel state between  RCM and UP and also keeps count of the tunnels idle-

state and count of encrypted/decrypted  packets.

RCM IPSec

RCM  IPSec during Switchover

During RCM switchover, Standby RCM becomes Active. During this time, UPs try reconnecting  with the new
RCM. However, the reconnection  fails as the new  RCM does not have an IPSec tunnel.  To resolve this
reconnection  failure, IPSec  keepalive timer must be configured. IPSec  keepalive timer expires as new  RCM
does not send keepalive messages. When this happens,  UP triggers the establishment of new  IPSec tunnel.
After the IPSec tunnel  is established, all UP connections toward new RCM becomes operational, and IPSec
data is exchanged.

Limitations and Restrictions

The following are the known limitations/restrictions of RCM IPSec  feature:

•  Dynamic change  of IPSec mode is not supported.

Configuring strongSwan with static routing table is supported. Dynamic routing table update is not

RCM and SMI Cluster Manager  Integration

RCM and SMI Cluster Manager Integration

Feature Description

The Subscriber Microservices Infrastructure (SMI) Kubernetes  (K8s) Cluster Manager allows you to deploy 5G
Network Functions (NFs) which are developed based on SMI. SMI Cluster Manager  (SMI CM) can also deploy
UPF that is based on StarOS image.

The Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) core function pack (CFP) prepares the configuration that is required
to deploy all NFs including RCM, SMF, and UPF.

StarOS Network Element Drivers (NEDs) in the NSO is used to configure the UPF. The NED prepares the StarOS
CLI from the configurations that are done through the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) on NSO and
pushes them to the UPFs. The RCM is configured using NSO through the NETCONF  client on port 2022.

The K8s worker is a cluster of nodes managed by an instance of Kubernetes.  However, for RCM, the K8s
cluster is a single node.

How it Works

The SMI CM provisions the K8s clusters. Each K8s cluster deploys a particular NF. The RCM, a Cisco
proprietary NF for UPFs that provides N:M redundancy,  is allocated to one of the K8s worker clusters. The RCM
must be a single-node K8s cluster. When RCM HA is used, the SMI CM brings up two RCM K8s clusters in
separate nodes. These RCM clusters must be collocated in the same rack as the UPFs. The SMI CM brings up
RCM pods like it does for other 5G NF components.

1.  Once the SMI CM provisions the RCM pods in a K8s cluster, the rcm-ops-center starts running on that

single-node RCM cluster.

2.  NSO configures the Day-1 RCM configuration on each of the RCMs (Active and Standby).

The Day-1 configuration consists:

45

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM and SMI Cluster Manager  Integration

o  Endpoint information: rcm-controller, rcm-bfdmgr, rcm-configmgr, replicas of rcm-checkppointmgr,

rcm-keepalived and, optionally, rcm-snmp-trapper and rcm-ipsec nodes.

o

IP addresses, BFD timers, and other operational parameters for logging levels, and so on.

3.  When VIP is configured for rcm-keepalived pod on both RCM clusters, VRRP  connection on both clusters is

established. One of them is selected as master/primary and other as backup.

4.  Once the required functional pods of RCM on each cluster is up and running,  the NSO configures the

required UPs Day-1 configuration on each  RCM. For details about configuration, see the Configuring RCM
and UPF for Redundancy  section.

5.  The SMI CM provisions the UPF on a VM. Once the UPF boots, it is configured with RCM context. Using the
details on RCM endpoint IP in rcm-context configuration, the UPF establishes connection with the Active
RCM.

6.  The Day-1 UPF configuration is pushed by RCM/NSO  based on the configuration mode.

The cee-ops-center  in SMI CM monitors all the K8s clusters. It has pods for collecting various diagnostic
information from each cluster, such as Prometheus, alert managers,  log retrievers, and so on. The cee-ops-
center  on the SMI CM collects information from both the cluster of RCMs and displays collective information on
its dashboard.

Call Flows

UPFs Configured by RCM

The following call flow illustrates bringing up of RCM using SMI CM and NSO core function pack (CFP) if the
RCM configures the UPFs.

46

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM and SMI Cluster Manager  Integration

UPFs Configured by NSO

The following call flow illustrates bringing up of RCM when  NSO configures the UPFs, and RCM needs  only the
host-specific configuration from NSO where  it uses that configuration during switchover.

Provisioning RCM

All the RCM components can be deployed as pods using the helm charts. Each  individual pod in RCM is built on
SMI application infrastructure like other cloud native NFs. The  RCM product is bundled as tar images.

SMI CM can only provision one RCM per single-node K8s cluster. The  RCM BFDMgr runs in host networking
mode. There is a possibility for port conflict if other running applications use the same port as RCM pods. Since
RCM is specifically customized for StarOS UP/UPFs,  we recommend isolating the RCM pods from other NFs.

RCM  HA in SMI CM

The SMI CM deploys two RCMs as two separate single node K8s clusters. Both the RCMs communicate over
VRRP to determine Master/Backup  roles. The SMI CM is unaware  of the redundancy  that is achieved  by the two
RCM K8s clusters using the rcm-keepalived.

When rcm-keepalived pods come up after configuring with VRRP parameters, they communicate and
determine the Master/Primary. The Master/Primary RCM serves all the UPFs to provide redundancy.

The health monitoring script in each  RCM cluster runs periodically to check the status of the current  cluster. If
any issue is detected, the entire namespace  must be redeployed. To trigger the RCM namespace  reload, a

47

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
RCM and SMI Cluster Manager  Integration

script is provisioned on the node that communicates with the rcm-keepalived.  Redeploying only the RCM
namespace  avoids unnecessary  reload of non-RCM NFs if they are deployed in the same cluster.

Configuring RCM and UPF for Redundancy

The NSO is leveraged  for configuring various NFs, including RCM. The NSO configures RCM, required  to
support redundancy,  using the NETCONF interface.

When configuration of UPF is done through RCM, the NSO provides the configuration required for UPFs in a
format that is interpreted by the RCM.

The common configuration that must be configured by NSO for UPF, through RCM, is in the following syntax:

configure
   redundancy-group group_number
      common line_number “staros_cli_string”
      end

The host configuration that must be configured by NSO for UPF, through RCM, is in the following syntax:

configure

   svc-type { upinterface | sxsvc | upsvc | gtpusvc | cpgrp | li }
      redundancy-group group_number
         host line_number “staros_cli_string”

         end

Configuring UPF Credentials in SMI CM

For details about the configuring UPF credentials, see Configuring UPF Credentials. It is also possible to
configure the default credentials for each  redundancy  group, wherein  you need  not configure the credentials
for each UPF. If credentials are not explicitly configured for any UPF, the default credentials are used.

Monitoring and Troubleshooting

This section provides information about the functionality available to monitor and/or troubleshoot RCM in SMI
CM.

Log Forwarding and Gather TAC

The SMI CM leverages journalD service—a  Linux system service for collecting and storing log data—running  on
the node and uses the log-forwarder to forward the logs to the configured server on the CEE.

The Gather TAC functionality, developed to fetch the cores and logs, is reused by SMI CM to fetch cores and
logs from RCM cluster like any other NFs.

For details, refer the Log Forwarding and Gather TAC sections in the UCC SMI Common Execution Environment
Configuration and Administration Guide.

M etrics and Alerts

The metrics for each RCM pod is defined per Prometheus.  The metrics are incremented/decremented  using the
APIs provided by the SMI App-infra.

The metrics from each RCM POD is exposed at port 8081:

prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'

prometheus.io/port: "8081"

The 8081 port is exposed in each pod’s service.

- name: metrics

  port: 8081

NOTE:

•  A label for a metric must be defined in metrics/metric-labels.go

•  Add the defined label to the SMI App-infra using GetPrometheusLabelss  “Add” method.

•

Register the added metric using the “RegisterCounter_V1”/“RegisterGauge_V1”

method.

•  All available APIs to be used on counters can be found in GIT repository.

•  All the Alerts that are part of SMI App-infra of the RCM pods is available at cee-ops-center.

•

For details about the counters/metrics that are added for RCM pods, see the Appendix G:  RCM Metrics
section.

Grafana

Grafana is an open-source data visualization tool used for displaying application metrics in interactive
dashboards. A separate dashboard is created  to monitor the metrics exposed by the RCM pods.

For details about Grafana,  refer the Grafana section in the UCC SMI Common Execution  Environment
Configuration and Administration Guide.

Appendix A: Deployment Parameters

CAUTION: This section provides sizing parameters and recommendations based on typical deployment
setup, and its solely for your reference.

Typical Deployment

Typical deployment consists of:

•

10 Active UPs per RCM

•  One or multiple redundancy group with total of 10 Active UPs across all redundancy  groups

•

•

Each  UP with 10 SessMgrs

Total UP capacity with 200k (approx.) sessions and per session size of 38 KB (approx.)

o  Approx. 7.2 GB for 200k sessions (Approx. 1.8 GB with compression)

Parameters

For a typical deployment, consider the following sizing parameters:

•  Memory

•  CPU

•  Network

•  Hard Disk

The required resources differ with:

•

•

•

The number of UPs registered with RCM

The number of SessMgrs in each UP

The number of sessions in each  SessMgr of an UP

•  Call Events Per Second (CEPS)

M emory Sizing

For a Typical Deployment example given above:

•  All checkpoints are stored in RAM

•  Memory required for checkpoints for each  UP is 2 GB (approx.)

•  Application garbage collector takes time to free up old checkpoints

•  Checkpoints are  continuous (Added/Modified/Deleted)

•

•

Based on CEPS

Typically requires 4 GB for one UP with 200k sessions excluding operational overhead of minimum 10 GB.

To support 10 UPs with 200k sessions each and 500 CEPS, recommended  size of RAM is minimum of 50 GB.

50

Redundancy Configuration Manager - Configuration and Administration Guide, Release 2021.01
Appendix A: Deployment Parameters

CPU Sizing

The following parameters must be considered for CPU sizing:

•

The number of Checkpoint Managers (ChkpointMgrs)/Redundancy Managers (RedMgrs) should be equal to
the number of SessMgrs in each  UP.

•  All UP has same number  of SessMgrs.

•  During switchover, all the ChkpointMgrs work parallelly to flush checkpoints from RCM to new Active UP:

o  To achieve true parallelism, it is recommended  to have as many cores as the number of ChkpointMgrs.
o  Additionally, two cores for operations involving other pods.

Note: You can try with lesser number of cores if the total number of sessions are less.

Network Sizing

The following parameters must be considered for network sizing:

•

Requires two interfaces:

o  RCM service interface where  checkpoints are transferred

o  Management  interface where  SSH and SFTP of configurations can  be performed

You can  use RCM interface and configure in RCM context of UP. However, its recommended to keep
them separate.

•  Additionally, operational interface  to login to the Ops Center  and for NETCONF communication to configure
the Ops Center.  Operations interface is also used to collect logs, diagnose, alert, and so on. This interface
can be same as Management  interface.

•

•

For RCM High Availability (HA), an additional L2-level network for VRRP  is required.

Speed:

o  Minimum of 25Gbps link for RCM interface  for checkpoints

(Low latency as BFD runs on this interface.)

o  A basic 1Gbps link for management  interface

Hard Disk Sizing

The following parameters must be considered for hard disk sizing:

•  Disk space required for logging, docker images, and so on.

•

•

•

It is recommended to have at least 40 GB of disk space.

If resource crunch  occurs, the pods are evicted.

Some persistent storage to preserve  data across reboots.

The following table is a typical recommendation.

Appendix E: P2P/ADC Plugin Configuration and Update
Procedure

This section provides information about P2P/ADC Plugin configuration and update procedure.

The following steps are required in all the UPs.

3.  Copy the patch to /flash of all the UPs.

4.  To patch the plugin, execute  the following CLI command:

patch plugin p2p /flash/libp2p-<plugin_filename>

5.  To install the plugin, execute  the following CLI command:

install plugin p2p patch_libp2p-<plugin_filename>

6.  Configure the P2P module and upgrade it through RCM for all the UPs (Active and Standby in one step):

configure
   plugin plugin_name
      module priority number version plugin_version
      end
update module plugin_name

To roll back the P2P/ADC plugin in all UPs, execute  the following CLI command in Exec  mode:

rollback module plugin_name

NOTES:

•

You must load, patch,  and install the plugin on all the UPs individually.

•  Configurations in Step 4 is loaded in the RCM configuration file using the Modify script. For details, see

Modifying Host Configuration section.

•

Ensure  to save the plugin at CP and UP.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2022-20649: Cisco RCM Debug Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in Cisco RCM for Cisco StarOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform remote code execution on the application with *root*-level privileges in the context of the configured container.  This vulnerability exists because the debug mode is incorrectly enabled for specific services. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the device and navigating to the service with debug mode enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the *root* user.  The attacker would need to perform detailed reconnaissance to allow for unauthenticated access. The vulnerability can also be exploited by an authenticated attacker.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.0 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.1 |
