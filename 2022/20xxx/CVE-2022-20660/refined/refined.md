  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-20660",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the information storage architecture of several Cisco IP Phone models could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to obtain confidential information from an affected device. This vulnerability is due to unencrypted storage of confidential information on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by physically extracting and accessing one of the flash memory chips. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain confidential information from the device, which could be used for subsequent attacks.",
    "affected_products": [
      "IP Conference Phone 7832",
      "IP Conference Phone 8832",
      "IP Phones 7811, 7821, 7841, and 7861",
      "IP Phones 8811, 8841, 8845, 8851, 8861, and 8865",

      "Unified SIP Phone 3905",
      "Wireless IP Phones 8821 and 8821-EX"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the unencrypted storage of the phone password within the flash memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cleartext storage of sensitive information"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could obtain the phone's administrative password, potentially enabling further attacks by using this information.",
    "attack_vector": "Physical access to the device is required. The attacker needs to extract and analyze flash memory contents.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to physically access the phone, desolder the memory, and read its content. Basic knowledge of analyzing memory dumps using tools like 'strings' is necessary."
