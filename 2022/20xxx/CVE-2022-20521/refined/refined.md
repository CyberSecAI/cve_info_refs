Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20521:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of `msg_id` and `thread_type` parameters before they are concatenated in `MmsSmsProvider#query`. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Unvalidated input parameters (`msg_id` and `thread_type`) are directly used in constructing an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided text states the impact is DoS. An attacker could craft malicious input that leads to a denial of service. While SQL Injection could have other impacts (like data exfiltration), based on the provided texts, the identified impact is only DoS.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted SMS/MMS messages:** An attacker could send a specially crafted SMS or MMS message that includes malicious values in `msg_id` or `thread_type`. The vulnerable code processes this message, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to send SMS/MMS messages:** The attacker must have the ability to send messages to the target device. This could be an attacker on the same network or someone with a phone number that can message the target device.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves checking the values of `msg_id` and `thread_type` before concatenating them into an SQL query.
- The vulnerability exists in the `MmsSmsProvider#query` function.
