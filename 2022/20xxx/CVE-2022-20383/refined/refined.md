  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the camera component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector is not detailed but the vulnerability resides in the camera component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be in a position to exploit a vulnerability within the camera component. Specific capabilities required are not stated, however, given it's an EoP vulnerability, the attacker would need to have some level of access or control over a vulnerable process or data that the camera component handles."
