  "CVE-2022-20412": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A comparison warning in `fdt_offset_ptr()` within the libfdt library.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect comparison logic in `fdt_offset_ptr()` which can lead to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local Elevation of Privilege (EoP)",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access, likely through a crafted device tree.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to influence the device tree passed to libfdt. This would likely require local access with system privileges, possibly through a malicious or compromised system process."
