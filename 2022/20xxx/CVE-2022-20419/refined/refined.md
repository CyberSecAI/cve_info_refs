Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way shared-element transitions are handled in Android. Specifically, the `ActivityOptions` object, which is used to pass data between activities during transitions, was not properly sanitized before being sent to another application. This object could contain sensitive information, such as a `RemoteTransition` object, which, when passed to an unrelated app, could expose that information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive data within the `ActivityOptions` object, intended only for the calling activity, is being sent to unrelated apps during shared-element transitions.
- Inadequate Sanitization: The Activity Manager did not properly strip sensitive data from the `ActivityOptions` before passing it on.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could gain access to sensitive information passed within the `ActivityOptions` object, including data present in the `RemoteTransition` object. This information leak can potentially lead to further attacks if the leaked data contains credentials, identifiers or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during a shared-element transition between activities. A malicious application could initiate a transition with a target activity in another application, causing sensitive data to be leaked to the target app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to start an activity transition with shared elements, which can be achieved by having a malicious app installed on the device that can trigger a transition with a vulnerable app.
- No special privileges are required for the exploit, other than the ability to initiate an activity transition.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix involves stripping sensitive information from the `ActivityOptions` before sending it to another application. This ensures that only relevant transition parameters are passed during a transition.
- The vulnerability is marked as "Critical" in the Android Security Bulletin for the 2022-10-01 patch level.
- The vulnerability is present in Android 12L and 13.
- The patch for this vulnerability is available in AOSP under commit `e5dd8be748c76c11615050c610dfc1fae73ad4a4`
