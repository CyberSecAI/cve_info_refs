Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20124:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content indicates this CVE is related to an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability in the Android Framework.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to a flaw that allows non-admin users to potentially uninstall or downgrade system applications. It is related to the logic of the isDataOrObbPath check when accessing Android/data or Android/obb directories via FUSE, and the lack of proper restrictions on non-admin users uninstalling system applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect access check for FUSE paths:** The `isDataOrObbPath` check had an issue where it would prematurely return if an app tried to access another directory within Android/data or Android/obb on secondary volumes, preventing further checks.
- **Insufficient restrictions on system app uninstallation:** Non-admin users were able to uninstall or downgrade system apps, which should not be possible without specific permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially elevate their privileges by exploiting the weaknesses, such as uninstalling system applications.  
- The incorrect access check for FUSE paths could be leveraged to bypass permission checks related to data access.
- Non-admin users could impact system stability and functionality by removing or downgrading critical system components.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local exploitation:**  A malicious app installed on the device could exploit the FUSE access check and the system app uninstallation flaws locally.
- This vulnerability could affect users who have non-admin users on a device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- **Non-admin user**: The attacker could be a non-admin user of the system trying to uninstall or downgrade a system app.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commits (`ae313d6d4082089798d067f318eb068cfb6bd15d` and `0a6bf309f0106fdd2981088fde3f9712856ae783`) resolve issues related to incorrect `isDataOrObbPath` checks and ensure proper access restrictions on non-admin user operations.
- The fix prevents non-admin users from uninstalling/downgrading system apps unless `DELETE_SYSTEM_APP` is specified.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Android versions 10, 11, 12, 12L, and 13.
