Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-20778:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** within the web-based interface of the authentication component of Cisco Webex Meetings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input before using it within the web interface. This lack of validation is the direct cause of the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful attack could enable the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the vulnerable web interface.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** Exploiting this vulnerability could allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information (e.g., cookies, session tokens, etc).
*   **Potential Account Hijacking:** By obtaining session cookies, an attacker could potentially hijack a user's session and take over the account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Link:** The attacker crafts a special URL containing malicious script code, and persuades a user to click on it.
*   **Web-Based Interface:** The attack is targeted at the web-based interface of the Cisco Webex Meetings authentication component.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can conduct this attack remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:**  The attacker doesn't require any prior authentication to exploit this flaw. They only need to lure a user to click the malicious URL.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to employ social engineering tactics to convince the victim to click the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**

*   **No Workarounds:** Cisco states that there are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. No user action is required because Webex Meetings is a cloud based service.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 6.1 (Medium severity).
