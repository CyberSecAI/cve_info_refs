{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A slab-out-of-bounds access occurs in the packet_recvmsg() function when an AF_PACKET socket uses PACKET_COPY_THRESH and mmap operations, leading to a copy of data from a skb with garbage into user space.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read/write"
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege due to possible memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by using AF_PACKET socket with PACKET_COPY_THRESH and mmap operations.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create and use AF_PACKET sockets and perform mmap operations."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "technical_details": "The syzbot found that when an AF_PACKET socket is using PACKET_COPY_THRESH and mmap operations, tpacket_rcv() is queueing skbs with garbage in skb->cb[], triggering a too big copy. There is a stack-out-of-bounds in memcpy.",
     "affected_function": "packet_recvmsg() and memcpy()",
     "memory_corruption": "The vulnerability can lead to stack-out-of-bounds write in the memcpy() function",
     "mitigation": "The fix involves clearing 12 bytes that might be copied to user space later to avoid the out-of-bounds access."
