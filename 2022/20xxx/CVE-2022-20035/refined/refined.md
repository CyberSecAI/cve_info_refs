- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free in the vcu driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to local escalation of privilege, where an attacker with some system execution privileges can gain elevated privileges on the system. The vulnerability can also lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some level of access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs System execution privileges to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is not required.
