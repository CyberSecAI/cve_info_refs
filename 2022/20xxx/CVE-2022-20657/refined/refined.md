Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20657:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM). Specifically, the interface does not properly validate user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit enables the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected web interface.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive browser-based information, including cookies and session tokens.
*  **Content Manipulation**: The attacker could modify the content of the HTML page

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker relies on persuading a user of the affected interface to click on a crafted link to trigger the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Links:** The attacker needs to be able to create a link containing malicious code.
*  **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must convince a user to click the crafted link to trigger the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM).
*  Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The advisory mentions that proof-of-concept exploit code is available.
