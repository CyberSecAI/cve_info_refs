  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an improper check in the code function that manages the verification of the digital signatures of system image files during the initial boot process.",
      "weaknesses": "Improper check in the code function that manages the verification of the digital signatures of system image files during the initial boot process.",
      "impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification check part of the boot process of the affected device.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software on an affected device.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs either unauthenticated physical access to the device or privileged access to the root shell on the device. Note: In Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and later, root shell access is protected by the Consent Token mechanism. However, an attacker with level-15 privileges could easily downgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software running on a device to a release where root shell access is more readily available."
