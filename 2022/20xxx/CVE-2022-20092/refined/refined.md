- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in alac decoder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing bounds check, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires no additional execution privileges and no user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable alac decoder.
