# Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Compatibility Guide

This guide provides software and hardware compatibility for Cisco Secure
Firewall Threat Defense. For related compatibility guides, see the following table.

| **Note** | ---   Not all software versions, especially patches, apply to all platforms. A quick way to tell if a version is supported is that its upgrade/installation packages are posted on the Cisco Support & Download site. If the site is "missing" an upgrade or installation package, that version is not supported. You can also check the release notes and [End-of-Life Announcements](#id_85448). If you feel a version is missing in error, contact Cisco TAC.   --- |

## Suggested Release: Version 7.4.2

To take advantage of new features and resolved issues, we recommend you upgrade all
eligible appliances to at least the suggested release, including the latest patch.
On the Cisco Support & Download
site, the suggested release is marked with a gold star. In Version 7.2.6+/7.4.1+, the
management center notifies you when a new suggested release is available, and
indicates suggested releases on its product upgrades page.

### Suggested Releases for Older Appliances

If an appliance is too old to run the suggested release and you do not plan to
refresh the hardware right now, choose a major version then patch as far as
possible. Some major versions are designated *long-term* or *extra
long-term*, so consider one of those. For an explanation of these terms, see
[Cisco NGFW Product Line Software
Release and Sustaining Bulletin](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/firewalls/bulletin-c25-743178.html).

If you are interested in a hardware refresh, contact your Cisco representative or
partner contact.

## Threat Defense Platform Summary

These tables summarize the supported devices and on-prem (customer-deployed)
management methods for threat
defense.

| **Note** | ---   The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center can manage threat defense 7.0.3 to 7.6.0 (except 7.1). For Security Cloud Control with device manager, you must be running at least threat defense 6.4.   --- |

## Threat Defense Hardware

### Firepower 1000/2100 Series

Firepower 1000/2100 series devices use the FXOS operating
system. Upgrading threat defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled
FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425). These devices can also run ASA instead of threat defense; see [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

### Secure Firewall 1200 Series

Secure Firewall 1200 series devices use the FXOS operating system. Upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled FXOS versions, see
[Bundled Components](#id_67425). These devices can also run ASA instead of threat defense; see
[Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

Table 5. Secure Firewall 1200 Series Compatibility

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 1210**  **Secure Firewall 1220** |
| --- | --- |
| 7.6 | **YES** |

### Secure Firewall 3100/4200 Series

Secure Firewall 3100/4200 series devices use the FXOS operating system. How FXOS is upgraded depends on
whether the device is in application mode or multi-instance mode. These devices can
also run ASA instead of threat defense; see [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

#### Application Mode

In application mode, upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Table 6. Secure Firewall 3100/4200 Series Application Mode Compatibility

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 4215**  **Secure Firewall 4225**  **Secure Firewall 4245** | **Secure Firewall 3105** | **Secure Firewall 3110**  **Secure Firewall 3120**  **Secure Firewall 3130**  **Secure Firewall 3140** |

| 7.3 | — | **YES** | **YES** |
| 7.2 | — | — | **YES** |
| 7.1 | — | — | **YES** |

#### Multi-Instance Mode

In multi-instance mode, you upgrade the chassis (FXOS and firmware) and threat
defense separately. However, one package contains both components. It is possible to
have a chassis-only upgrade or a threat defense-only upgrade. For information on
bundled FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Although you can run older threat defense instances on a newer
FXOS, new features and resolved issues
often require a full upgrade.

Table 7. Secure Firewall 3100/4200 Series Multi-Instance Mode Compatibility

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 4215**  **Secure Firewall 4225**  **Secure Firewall 4245** | **Secure Firewall 3110**  **Secure Firewall 3120**  **Secure Firewall 3130**  **Secure Firewall 3140** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7.6 | **YES** | **YES** |
| 7.4.1–7.4.x | — | **YES** |

### Firepower 4100/9300

For the Firepower 4100/9300, major threat
defense versions have a specially qualified and recommended companion FXOS version,
listed below in **bold**. Use these combinations whenever possible, because we
perform enhanced testing for them. Note that the table lists the minimum build for
each FXOS version, but in most cases we recommend the latest. For more information,
see the [Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS Release
Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-9000-series/products-release-notes-list.html).

| **Note** | ---   Although we document that FXOS 2.14.1.163+ is required for threat defense 7.4.x, this is for reimaging to 7.4.2+. If you are already running an earlier FXOS 2.14.1 build, you can successfully upgrade to 7.4.2+ without upgrading FXOS ([CSCwf64429](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf64429)).   --- |
| --- | --- |

These devices can also run ASA instead of threat
defense. With ASA 9.12+ and threat
defense 6.4.0+, you can run both ASA and threat
defense on separate modules in the same Firepower 9300 chassis. For more information, see
[Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/compatibility/fxos-compatibility.html).

### ASA 5500-X Series and ISA 3000

ASA 5500-X series and ISA 3000 devices use the ASA operating
system. Upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades ASA. For information on the bundled ASA versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Version 7.0 is the last major threat
defense release that supports ASA 5500-X series devices.

## Threat Defense High Availability and Clustering

These tables list threat defense support for high availability and clustering. For
threat defense hardware, support differs depending on whether you are using
standalone devices (also called native instances or application mode) or container
instances (also called multi-instance mode). Threat defense virtual does not support
container instances.

### Standalone Devices

This table lists threat defense hardware support for high availability and clustering
with standalone devices. In management center deployments, all threat defense
hardware supports high availability. For device manager, high availability support
begins in Version 6.3 and clustering is not supported.

Threat Defense Management

## On-Prem Management Center

All devices support remote management with a customer-deployed (*on-prem*)
management center.

Versions are major (A.x), maintenance (A.x.y), or patch (A.x.y.z). The management
center should run the same or newer version as its devices. New features and
resolved issues often require the latest version on both the management center and its devices, including patches. Upgrade the management center first—you will still be able to manage older devices, usually a few major
versions
back

| **Note** | ---   You cannot upgrade a device past the management center to a newer major or maintenance version. Although a patched device (fourth-digit) can be managed with an unpatched management center, fully patched deployments undergo enhanced testing.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Note
that in most cases you can upgrade an older device directly to the management center's major or maintenance version. However, sometimes you can manage an older
device that you cannot directly upgrade, even though the target version is
supported on the device. And rarely, there are issues with specific management center-device combinations. For release-specific requirements, see the release
notes.

## Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center

The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center can manage threat
defense devices running **Version 7.0.3 to 7.6.0 (except Version 7.1)**.

You can co-manage a cloud-managed device with a Version 7.2+ on-prem management center for event logging and analytics purposes only. Or, you can send security events
to the Cisco cloud with Security
Analytics and Logging (SaaS).

### Co-managing Devices with an Analytics Management Center

The cloud-delivered Firewall
Management Center supports a wider range of managed device versions than on-prem management
centers. This can cause issues if you use an on-prem management center for
analytics because devices can be "too old" or "too new" to co-manage.

You can be prevented from:

* Registering newer devices to the analytics management center because
  older devices are blocking the required management center upgrade.
* Upgrading co-managed devices to the latest release, because the analytics
  management center is "stuck" at an older release.
* Reverting device upgrade, if revert would take the device out of
  compatibility with the analytics management center.

For example, consider a scenario where you want to add co-managed Version 7.6.0
devices to a deployment that currently includes co-managed Version 7.0.x
devices. The cloud-delivered Firewall
Management Center can manage this full range of devices, but the on-prem analytics management
center cannot.

In order of preference, you can:

* Upgrade the Version 7.0.x devices to at least Version 7.2.0, upgrade the
  analytics management center to Version 7.6.0, then add the Version 7.6.0
  devices to both management centers.
* Remove the Version 7.0.x devices from the analytics management center,
  upgrade the analytics management center to Version 7.6.0, then add the
  Version 7.6.0 devices to both management centers.
* Leave the analytics management center as it is and do not add your
  Version 7.6.0 devices.

That is, your choices are:

* To get events from all devices, upgrade (or replace) the analytics
  management center and your older devices.
* To forgo events from older devices, upgrade (or replace) the analytics
  management center only.
* To forgo events from newer devices, leave the analytics management center
  at an older release.

## Device Manager

You can use device
manager to locally manage a single threat
defense device. Most models suppport local management.

Optionally, add Cisco Security Cloud Control to remotely manage multiple threat
defense devices, as an alternative to the management center. Although some configurations still require device
manager, Security Cloud Control allows you to establish and maintain consistent security policies across your threat
defense deployment.

## Bundled Components

These tables list the versions of various
components bundled with threat
defense. Use this information to identify open or resolved bugs in bundled components
that may affect your deployment.

Note that sometimes we release updated builds for select releases. If bundled
components change from build to build, we list the components in the *latest*
build. (In most cases, only the latest build is available for
download.)
For details on new builds and the issues they resolve, see the release notes for
your version.

### Operating Systems

ASA 5500-X series and ISA 3000 devices use the ASA operating system. Firepower
1000/2100, Secure Firewall 1200, and Secure Firewall 3100/4200 series devices use
the FXOS operating system. For the Firepower 4100/9300, see [Firepower 4100/9300](#reference_6DF211D8F60F423387D0316000333539).

### System Databases

The vulnerability database (VDB) is a database of known vulnerabilities to which
hosts may be susceptible, as well as fingerprints for operating systems, clients,
and applications. The system uses the VDB to help determine whether a particular
host increases your risk of compromise.

The geolocation database (GeoDB) is a database that you can leverage to view and
filter traffic based on geographical location.

## Integrated Products

The Cisco products listed below may have other compatibility requirements, for
example, they may need to run on specific hardware, or on a specific operating
system. For that information, see the documentation for the appropriate
product.

| **Note** | ---   Whenever possible, we recommend you use the latest (newest) compatible version of each integrated product. This ensures that you have the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Identity Services and User Control

Note that with:

* Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC: We list the versions of ISE and ISE-PIC for which we
  provide enhanced compatibility testing, although other combinations may
  work.
* Cisco Firepower User Agent: Version 6.6 is the last management center release to support the user agent software as an identity source; this
  blocks upgrade to Version 6.7+.

  You can instead use the Passive Identity Agent with Microsoft Active Directory. For more information, see [User Control With the Passive Identity Agent](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/management-center/device-config/760/management-center-device-config-76/passive-identity-agent.html).
* Cisco TS Agent: Versions 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer available.

### Threat Defense Remote Access VPN

Remote access virtual private network (RA VPN) allows individual users to connect to
your network from a remote location using a computer or supported mobile device.
Keep in mind that newer threat defense features can require newer versions of the
client.

For more information, see the [Cisco Secure Client/AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
configuration guides](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

## Browser Requirements

### Browsers

We test with the latest versions of these popular browsers, running on currently
supported versions of macOS and Microsoft Windows:

Table 24. Browsers

| Browser | Device Manager Version |
| --- | --- |
| Google Chrome | Any |
| Mozilla Firefox | Any |
| Microsoft Edge (Windows only) | Version 6.7+ |
| Apple Safari | Not extensively tested. Feedback welcome. |

If you encounter issues with any other browser, or are running an operating system
that has reached end of life, we ask that you switch or upgrade. If you continue to
encounter issues or have feedback, contact Cisco TAC.

### Browser Settings and Extensions

Regardless of browser, keep JavaScript and
cookies enabled.
If you are using Microsoft Edge, do *not* enable IE mode.

Note that some browser extensions can prevent you from saving values in fields like
the certificate and key in PKI objects. These extensions include, but are not
limited to, Grammarly and Whatfix Editor. This happens because these extensions
insert characters (such as HTML) in the fields, which causes the system to see them
invalid. We recommend you disable these extensions while you’re logged into our
products.

### Screen Resolution

Table 25. Screen Resolution

| **Interface** | **Minimum Resolution** |
| --- | --- |
| Device manager | 1024 x 768 |
| Chassis manager for the Firepower 4100/9300 | 1024 x 768 |

### Securing Communications

When you first log in, the system uses a self-signed digital certificate to secure
web communications. Your browser should display an untrusted authority warning, but
also should allow you to add the certificate to the trust store. Although this will
allow you to continue, we do recommend that you replace the self-signed certificate
with a certificate signed by a globally known or internally trusted certificate
authority (CA).

To begin replacing the self-signed certificate on device manager, click
Device, then the System Settings > Management Access link, then the Management Web Server tab.
For detailed procedures, see the online help or the [Cisco
Secure Firewall Device Manager Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-ngfw/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

| **Note** | ---   If you do not replace the self-signed certificate:   * Google Chrome does not cache static content, such as images, CSS, or   JavaScript. Especially in low bandwidth environments, this can extend   page load times. * Mozilla Firefox can stop trusting the self-signed certificate when the   browser updates. If this happens, you can refresh Firefox, keeping in   mind that you will lose some settings; see Mozilla's *[Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings)* support   page.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Browsing from a Monitored Network

Many browsers use Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3 by default. If you are using an
SSL policy to handle encrypted traffic, and people in your monitored network use
browsers with TLS v1.3 enabled, websites that support TLS v1.3 may fail to load.

| **Note** | ---   In Version 6.2.3 and earlier, websites that support TLS v1.3 always fail to load. As a workaround, you can configure managed devices to remove extension 43 (TLS 1.3) from ClientHello negotiation; see the software advisory titled: [*Failures loading websites using TLS 1.3 with SSL inspection enabled*](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/SA/SW_Advisory_CSCvh22181.html). In Version 6.2.3.7+, you can specify when to downgrade; see the system support  commands in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense.html) after consulting with Cisco TAC.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## End-of-Life Announcements

The following tables provide end-of-life details. Dates that have passed
are in **bold**.

### Snort

If you are still using the Snort 2 inspection engine with threat defense, switch to Snort 3
now for improved detection and performance. It is available starting in threat defense
Version 6.7+ (with device manager) and Version 7.0+ (with management center). Snort 2 will
be deprecated in a future release. You will eventually be unable to upgrade
Snort 2 devices.

In management center deployments, upgrading to threat defense Version
7.2+ also upgrades eligible Snort 2 devices to Snort
3.
For devices that are ineligible because they use custom intrusion or network analysis
policies, manually upgrade Snort. See Migrate from Snort 2 to Snort 3 in the
[Cisco Secure Firewall
Management Center Snort 3 Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/go/fmc-snort3).

In device manager deployments, manually upgrade Snort. See Intrusion Policies
in the [Cisco
Secure Firewall Device Manager Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-ngfw/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

These software versions on still-supported branches have been removed
from the Cisco Support & Download
site.

| **Note** | ---   In Version 6.2.3+, uninstalling a patch (fourth-digit release) results in an appliance running the version you upgraded from. This means that you can end up running a deprecated version simply by uninstalling a later patch. Unless otherwise stated, do *not* remain at a deprecated version. Instead, we recommend you upgrade. If upgrade is impossible, uninstall the deprecated patch.   --- |

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.

"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Server Message Block Version 2 (SMB2) processor of the Snort detection engine on multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to improper management of system resources when the Snort detection engine is processing SMB2 traffic. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a high rate of certain types of SMB2 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the Snort process, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNote: When the snort preserve-connection option is enabled for the Snort detection engine, a successful exploit could also allow the attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network. The snort preserve-connection setting is enabled by default. See the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory for more information.\r\n\r\nNote: Only products that have Snort 3 configured are affected. Products that are configured with Snort 2 are not affected.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-smb-3nfhJtr [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-wsa-unauth-devreset\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.

"text": "snort preserve-connection Settings\r\nThe impact of these vulnerabilities can be twofold, depending on whether the snort preserve-connection setting is enabled or disabled and whether a traffic flow began before the Snort process went down or began while the Snort process was down.\r\n\r\nThe behavior for traffic flows that were established before the Snort process went down is configuration dependent. The behavior for traffic flows that begin while the Snort process is down is not configuration dependent and always results in a DoS condition. For details on the snort preserve-connection setting, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command\_ref/b\_Command\_Reference\_for\_Firepower\_Threat\_Defense/c\_3.html#wp1594004510\"] and the Snort Restart Traffic Behavior [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/policy\_management.html#concept\_uc1\_gtq\_ty\"] section of the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide.\r\n snort preserve-connection Is Enabled\r\nWhen the snort preserve-connection option is enabled for the Snort detection engine, existing traffic flow are not dropped when the Snort process goes down. Instead, existing traffic flows bypass the Snort detection engine. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network. Traffic flows that begin while the Snort process is down are dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score for existing traffic flows is as follows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score for new traffic flows is as follows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L\r\n snort preserve-connection Is Disabled\r\nWhen the snort preserve-connection option is disabled for the Snort detection engine, existing traffic flows are dropped. A successful exploit could result in a DoS condition. Traffic flows that begin while the Snort process is down are also dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score is the same for both new and existing traffic flows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L\r\n Determine the Cisco FTD Software Configuration\r\nThe snort preserve-connection setting is enabled by default. To view the current setting, log in to the Cisco FTD Software CLI and use the show running-config | include snort command. There are no GUI options for viewing the setting.\r\n\r\nIf the command produces the following output, snort preserve-connection is enabled on the device:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show running-config | include snort\r\nsnort preserve-connection\r\n>\r\n\r\nIf the command produces the following output, snort preserve-connection is disabled on the device:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show running-config | include snort\r\nno snort preserve-connection\r\n>"

"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "There is a workaround that addresses these vulnerabilities. To remove the attack vector for these vulnerabilities for Cisco FMC Software-managed devices and Cisco Defense Orchestrator-managed devices, configure a fastpath prefilter rule to bypass the Snort detection engine. To remove the attack vector for these vulnerabilities for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM)-managed devices, configure an access control rule to bypass the Snort detection engine.\r\n Workaround for Cisco FMC Software-Managed Devices\r\nTo configure a fastpath prefilter rule for SMB traffic for Cisco FMC Software-managed devices, do the following:\r\n\r\nLog in to the FMC web interface.\r\nFrom the Policies menu, under the Access Control section, choose Prefilter.\r\nChoose New Policy.\r\nEnter the Name and Description and click Save.\r\nIn the resulting window, ensure that Default Action: Tunnel Traffic is set to Analyze all tunnel traffic.\r\nClick Add Prefilter Rule.\r\nIn the resulting window, enter a rule Name and ensure the Enabled box is checked.\r\nFrom the Action drop-down menu, choose Fastpath.\r\nConfigure the policy under the Interfaces, Networks, and Vlan Tags tabs for SMB traffic on the affected network.\r\nClick the Port tab.\r\nEnter the following destination ports for SMB traffic: TCP (6):138, TCP (6):139, TCP (6):445 and UDP (17):137.\r\nClick Add to add the policy.\r\nClick Save to save the policy.\r\n\r\nTo associate the SMB prefilter policy with the access control policy deployed on Cisco FMC Software-managed devices, do the following:\r\n\r\nFrom the Policies menu, under the Access Control section, choose Access Control.\r\nFind the policy of interest.\r\nClick the Edit icon.\r\nClick the name next to Prefilter Policy.\r\nChoose the name of the newly created SMB prefilter policy from the drop-down menu.\r\nClick OK.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Prefiltering and Prefilter Policies [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/management-center/device-config/710/management-center-device-config-71/access-prefilter.html\"] chapter of the Firepower Management Center Device Configuration Guide.\r\n Workaround for Cisco FDM-Managed Devices\r\nFastpath is not supported on Cisco FDM-managed devices. Instead, set an access control policy with an action of trust for the appropriate ports.\r\n\r\nTo configure an access control policy to bypass SMB traffic for Cisco FDM-managed devices, do the following:\r\n\r\nLog in to the Cisco FDM web interface.\r\nFrom the Policies menu, choose Access Control.\r\nCreate a new policy by clicking the plus (+) sign.\r\nEnter a name and under the Action drop-down menu, choose Trust.\r\nIn the Port section, click the plus (+) sign.\r\nSelect Create new Port.\r\nEnter a name, protocol type, and port number for each of the following ports: TCP (6):138, TCP (6):139, TCP (6):445, and UDP (17):137.\r\nOnce the ports have been created, select the four ports to be added to the rule by selecting their names.\r\nClick OK when done.\r\nClick OK to add the policy.\r\nDeploy changes to Cisco FTD Software.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Access Control Chapter [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/710/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-710/fptd-fdm-access.html\"] of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager.\r\n Workaround for Cisco Defense Orchestrator-Managed Devices\r\nTo configure a fastpath prefilter rule for SMB traffic for Cisco Defense Orchestrator-managed devices, do the following:\r\n\r\nLog in to the Cisco Defense Orchestrator web interface.\r\nFrom the Policies menu, choose FTD Policies.\r\nFrom the Policies menu, under the Access Control section, choose Prefilter.\r\nClick New Policy.\r\nEnter the Name and Description and click Save.\r\nIn the resulting window, ensure that Default Action: Tunnel Traffic is set to Analyze all tunnel traffic.\r\nClick Add Prefilter Rule.\r\nIn the resulting window, enter a rule Name and ensure the Enabled box is checked.\r\nFrom the Action drop-down menu, select Fastpath.\r\nConfigure the policy under the Interfaces, Networks, and Vlan Tags tabs for SMB traffic on the affected network.\r\nClick the Port tab.\r\nEnter the following destination ports for SMB traffic: TCP (6):138, TCP (6):139, TCP (6):445, and UDP (17):137.\r\nClick Add to add the policy.\r\nClick Save to save the policy.\r\n\r\nTo associate the SMB prefilter policy with the access control policy deployed on Cisco Defense Orchestrator-managed devices, do the following:\r\n\r\nFrom the Policies menu, under the Access Control section, choose Access Control.\r\nFind the policy of interest.\r\nClick the Edit icon.\r\nClick the name next to Prefilter Policy.\r\nChoose the name of the newly created SMB prefilter policy from the drop-down menu.\r\nClick OK.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Cisco Defense Orchestrator website [\"https://docs.defenseorchestrator.com/\"].\r\n\r\nWhile this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment."

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

cluster enable
command.

cluster
enable

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

For the first unit enabled, a master unit election occurs.
Because the first unit should be the only member of the cluster so far, it will
become the master unit. Do not perform any configuration changes during this
period.

## Examples

The following example enables clustering on a unit:

```

> cluster enable

```

### Related Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cluster disable | Disables clustering. |
| cluster master unit | Sets a new unit as the master unit of a cluster. |
| cluster remove unit | Removes the unit from the cluster. |
| show cluster info | Shows cluster information. |
| cluster exec | Sends a command to all cluster members. |

## cluster exec

To execute a command on all units in the cluster, or on a
specific member, use the
cluster exec
command.

cluster exec `[` unitunit\_name`]`command

## Syntax Description

| unit unit\_name | (Optional) Performs the command on a specific unit. To view member names, enter cluster exec unit ?  (to see all names except the current unit), or enter the show cluster info  command. |
| --- | --- |
| command | Specifies the command you want to execute. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Sending a
show  command to
all members collects all output and displays it on the console of the current
unit. Other commands, such as
capture  and
copy , can also
take advantage of cluster-wide execution.

## Examples

To copy the same capture file from all units in the cluster at
the same time to a TFTP server, enter the following command on the master unit:

```

> cluster exec copy /pcap capture: tftp://10.1.1.56/capture1.pcap

```

Multiple PCAP files, one from each unit, are copied to the TFTP
server. The destination capture file name is automatically attached with the
unit name, such as capture1\_device1.pcap, capture1\_device2.pcap, and so on. In
this example, device1 and device2 are cluster unit names.

The following sample output for the
cluster exec show
port-channel  summary command shows EtherChannel information for
each member in the cluster:

```

> cluster exec show port-channel summary
primary(LOCAL):***********************************************************
 Number of channel-groups in use: 2

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The bootstrap configuration remains intact, as well as the last
configuration synced from the master unit, so you can later re-add the unit
without losing your configuration. If you enter this command on a slave unit to
remove the master unit, a new master unit is elected.

## Examples

The following example checks for unit names, and then removes
device2 from the cluster:

```

> cluster remove unit ?
Current active units in the cluster:
device2
> cluster remove unit device2
WARNING: Clustering will be disabled on unit device2. To bring it back
to the cluster please logon to that unit and re-enable clustering

## configure cert-update auto-update

To enable or disable the automatic update of CA certificates on the threat
defense device, use the configure cert-update auto-update  command.

configure cert-update auto-update
`{`
enable
`|`
disable
`}`

## Syntax Description

| enable | Enables automatic update of CA certificates. |
| --- | --- |
| disable | Disables automatic update of CA certificates. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 7.0.5 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

By default, the CA certificates are automatically updated when you install or upgrade threat
defense to version 7.0.5. If you want to disable this feature, use the disable  keyword. To re-enable the automatic update of the CA bundles, use the enable  keyword. When you enable the automatic update on the CA certificates, the update process is executed daily at a system-defined
time.

## Examples

The following is sample output from the configure cert-update auto-update  command:

```

> configure cert-update auto-update disable
Autoupdate is disabled
> configure cert-update auto-update enable
Autoupdate is enabled and set for every day at 12:18 UTC
```

### Related Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| show cert-update | Displays the status of automatic update of CA certificates. |
| configure cert-update run-now | Instantly attempt to update CA certifications. |
| configure cert-update test | Performs connection checks using the latest CA certificates from the Cisco server. |

## configure cert-update run-now

To instantly execute automatic update of CA certificates, use the configure cert-update run-now  command.

configure cert-update run-now
`[`
force
`]`

## Syntax Description

| force | Performs CA certificate updates, even when connection check fails. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 7.0.5 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

When you want to instantly update the CA certificates, use the configure cert-update run-now . However, if the SSL connectivity check fails for even one of the Cisco servers, the process is terminated. To proceed with
the update despite connection failures, use the force  keyword. For example, the local CA bundle has certificates to access several Cisco services such as smart licensing, AMP
registration, and ThreatGrid service, and if the connection to the Cisco smart licensing service fails, the certificates update
process is still executed if you use the configure cert-update run-now force  command.

| **Note** | ---   In an IPv6-only deployment, the automatic update of CA certificates may fail, because, some of the Cisco servers do not support IPv6. In such cases, force update the CA certificates using the configure cert-update run-now force  command.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

Following is a sample output from the configure cert-update run-now   command when the connection check fails:

```

> configure cert-update run-now
Certs failed some connection checks.

```

Following is a sample output from the configure cert-update run-now   command when the connection check succeeds and local CA bundle is updated:

```

>configure cert-update run-now
Certs have been replaced or was already up to date.

```

Following is a sample output from the configure cert-update run-now force  command:

```

> configure cert-update run-now force
Certs failed some connection checks, but replace has been forced.

```

configure cert-update test

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 7.0.5 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The configure cert-update test  command compares the CA bundle on the local system with the latest CA bundle (from the Cisco server). If the CA bundle is
up to date, no check is executed and the test result is displayed as shown in the Examples section below. If the CA bundle
is out of date, the connection check is executed on the downloaded CA bundle and the results are displayed as shown in the
Examples section below.

## Examples

Following is a sample output from the configure cert-update test  command when the local CA bundle is up to date:

```

> configure cert-update test
Test succeeded, certs can safely be updated or are already up to date.

```

Following is a sample output from the configure cert-update test  command when the local CA bundle is out of date and the connection check on the downloaded bundle fails:

```

| once | Full core dump is written only once and has to be enabled again manually. |

### Command Default

Snort 3 full core dump generation is disabled by default for a standalone setup. For high availability and cluster setups,
the default core dump generation is daily .

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.7 | This command was introduced. |
| 7.4.1, 7.2.6 | This command was enhanced to provide extra options for the core dump collection time periods, that is, daily ,  weekly , and once . |

### Usage Guidelines

Use the configure coredump snort3  command to trigger the generation of a core dump in case of a Snort 3 crash.

**High Availability**

For high-availability setups, use the configure coredump snort3  command to avoid traffic disruption and outage. Snort 3 core dump collection occurs:

* If the standby device is in **Healthy** state on active devices.
* If the device is not in **Active** state.

**Cluster**

For cluster setups, use the configure coredump snort3  command to avoid traffic disruption and outage. Snort 3 core collection occurs for a Snort 3 crash only if there are at least
two nodes in a cluster and the traffic passes through the second node.

## Examples

The following example shows how to enable the Snort 3 core dump generation at all times:

```

> configure coredump snort3 enable

```

## configure firewall

To set the firewall mode to transparent or routed mode, use the
configure
firewall  command.

configure firewall `{` routed `|`transparent`}`

## Syntax Description

| routed | Sets the firewall mode to routed firewall mode. |
| --- | --- |
| transparent | Sets the firewall mode to transparent firewall. |

### Command Default

By default, the device is in routed mode.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

A transparent firewall is a Layer 2 firewall that acts like a
“bump in the wire,” or a “stealth firewall,” and is not seen as a router hop to
connected devices.

When you change modes, the device clears the configuration
because many commands are not supported for both modes. If you already have a
populated configuration, be sure to back up your configuration before changing
the mode; you can use this backup for reference when creating your new
configuration.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot switch to transparent firewall mode if you are using the device manager. If you are using the local manager and you want to convert to transparent mode, you must first use configure manager delete  to remove the manager, convert to transparent mode, then use configure manager add  to point to the management center.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following example changes the firewall mode to transparent:

```

> configure firewall transparent

```

| show firewall | Shows the firewall mode. |

## configure flow-offload

This command enables or disables accelerating certain flows (that is, traffic) by processing them in hardware. Offloading
flow processing to hardware increases performance, and is enabled by default.

Dynamic flow offload is supported on the threat
defense on the Firepower 4100/9300 chassis. Dynamic flow offload enables you to select traffic to be offloaded to hardware, which
means it is not processed by the software or CPU of your threat
defense device.

configure flow-offload dynamic whitelist {enable | disable}

## Syntax Description

| dynamic whitelist enable | Enable dynamic offload. |
| --- | --- |
| dynamic whitelist disable | Disable dynamic offload. |

### Command Default

## configure high-availability

To disable, suspend, or resume a high-availability
configuration (also known as failover) between devices, use the configure high-availability  command.

configure high-availability
 `{`
disable
 `[`
clear-interfaces
`] |`
resume
 `|`
suspend
 `[`
clear-interfaces
`]}`

## Syntax Description

| clear-interfaces | (Optional) Clears interface configurations upon disabling or suspending high availability. |
| --- | --- |
| disable | Breaks the high-availability relationship between this device and its peer.  You cannot use this option on a locally-managed device; use device manager instead. If you mistakenly use the disable  command, you must follow it with an threat defense API call using the BreakHAStatus resource to complete the action. |
| resume | Resumes a temporarily suspended high-availability configuration between this device and its peer. The unit will negotiate active/standby status with the peer unit. You cannot resume a disabled configuration. |
| suspend | Temporarily suspends a high-availability configuration between this device and its peer. You can later resume the configuration.  If you suspend high availability from the active unit, the configuration is suspended on both the active and standby unit. If you suspend it from the standby unit, it is suspended on the standby unit only, but the active unit will not attempt to fail over to a suspended unit. |

### Usage Guidelines

You can configure two devices as a high-availability pair. This
is also known as a failover configuration, where one device can take over if the
other device in the pair fails.

You can use the configurehigh-availability  command to manage the
high-availability pair if for some reason you cannot update the configuration in the
device manager.

**Disabling High Availability**

When you disable a high-availability pair, the
high-availability configuration is removed from both units.

**When using the Management
interface for manager access:** The active unit remains up and
passing traffic. The standby unit interface configuration is erased.

**When using a data interface for
manager access:** See the following details.

* The active unit remains up and passing traffic.
* The standby unit data interfaces are shut down except for the manager access
  interface, which remains up using the standby IP address so it can maintain
  the management connection.
* If the primary unit is in the standby state:

  + The IP addresses for manager access are swapped permanently in the management center configuration: the primary unit uses the standby IP address, and
    the secondary unit uses the active IP address.
  + If the management center initiated the management connection, and you specified a hostname
    for the device, then you need to update the DNS server so the
    swapped IP addresses are associated with the correct hostnames.
  + Breaking high availability causes a deployment to the standby unit.
    If the management connection is not yet reestablished because of the
    swapped IP addresses, the deployment may fail. In this case, you
    will need to manually trigger the deployment after the management
    connection is established. Be sure to complete the standby
    deployment before deploying changes to the active unit.

**Suspending High Availability**

You can suspend a unit in a high-availability pair, which is useful when:

* Both units are in an active-active situation, and fixing the communication on
  the failover link does not correct the problem.
* You want to troubleshoot an active or standby unit and do not want the units
  to fail over during that time.
* You want to prevent failover while installing a software upgrade on the
  standby device.

When you suspend high availability, the currently active device remains active,
handling all user connections. However, failover criteria are no longer monitored,
and the system will never fail over to the now pseudo-standby device.

**When using the Management
interface for manager access:** The standby unit interface
configuration is erased.

**When using a data interface for
manager access:** The standby unit data interfaces are shut down except for
the manager access interface, which remains up using the standby IP address so it
can maintain the management connection.

The key difference between suspending high availability and breaking high
availability is that on a suspended high-availability device, the high-availability
configuration is retained. When you break high availability, the configuration is
erased. Thus, you have the option to resume high availability on a suspended system,
which enables the existing configuration and makes the two devices function as a
failover pair again.

| **Note** | ---   Suspending high availability is a temporary state. If you reload a unit, it resumes the high-availability configuration automatically and negotiates the active/standby state with the peer.   --- |

## configure https-access-list

To configure the device to accept HTTPS connections from
specified IP addresses, use the
configure
https-access-list  command.

configure
https-access-listaddress\_list

## Syntax Description

| address\_list | A comma separated list of IP addresses for hosts or networks, in IPv4 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation or IPv6 prefix length notation. For example, 10.100.10.0/24 or 2001:DB8::/96.  To specify all IPv4 hosts, enter 0.0.0.0/0. To specify all IPv6 hosts, specify ::/0. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

You must include all supported hosts or networks in a single
command. Addresses specified in this command overwrite the current contents of
the HTTPS access list.

Merely allowing HTTPS access does not permit users to log into
the local manager. Access to the configuration software is controlled by
username and password.

If the device is a unit in a
locally-managed high availability group, your change will be overwritten the
next time the active unit deploys configuration updates. If this is the active
unit, your change will be propagated to the peer during deployment.

## Examples

The following example configures the device to accept HTTPS
connections from any IPv4 or IPv6 address:

```

> configure https-access-list 0.0.0.0/0,::/0
The https access list was changed successfully.
> show https-access-list
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             state NEW tcp dpt:https
ACCEPT     tcp      anywhere             anywhere             state NEW tcp dpt:https

```

## configure inspection

To enable or disable the default application protocol inspection
engines, use the
configure
inspection  command.

configure
inspectionprotocol `{` enable `|`disable`}`

## Syntax Description

| disable | Disables the inspection engine. |
| --- | --- |
| enable | Enables the inspection engine. |
| protocol | The inspection protocol that you want to enable or disable. See the usage guidelines section for a list of options. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.2 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Disable the default inspection engines only at the direction of
Cisco Technical Support, or if you are certain that the associated types of
traffic do not occur on your network. For example, if you block all traffic on
an inspected port, you can safely disable inspection on that port. These
inspections are applied to all data interfaces.

These inspection engines are separate from Snort inspection.
These engines provide the following services:

* Pinhole creation—Some application protocols open secondary TCP
  or UDP connections either on standard or negotiated ports. Inspection opens
  pinholes for these secondary ports so that you do not need to create access
  control rules to allow them.
* NAT rewrite— Protocols such as FTP embed IP addresses and ports for the secondary connections in packet data as part of the
  protocol. If there is NAT translation involved for either of the endpoints, the inspection engines rewrite the packet data
  to reflect the NAT translation of the embedded addresses and ports. The secondary connections would not work without NAT rewrite.
  For NAT limitations, see the NAT chapter in the configuration guide for the manager you are using to configure the device
  (management center or device manager).
* Protocol enforcement—Some inspections enforce some degree of
  conformance to the RFCs for the inspected protocol.

You can disable, and subsequently enable, the following
inspection engines. To see what is currently enabled, use the
show running-config
policy-map  command and look for the
inspect
commands. To see details of the default parameters for each inspection, use the
show running-config all
policy-map
 command.

* dcerpc —(TCP port 135.) Distributed Computing
  Environment/Remote Procedure Calls. The DCERPC inspection engine inspects for
  native TCP communication between the Endpoint Mapper (EPM) and client on well
  known TCP port 135. Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC), based on DCERPC,
  is a protocol widely used by Microsoft distributed client and server
  applications that allows software clients to execute programs on a server
  remotely. Inspection provides pinhole creation and NAT services.
* dns —(UDP port 53.) Domain Name System. DNS is
  inspected on UDP port 53. Inspection provides NAT services and protocol
  enforcement. You must enable this inspection engine to use the NAT rewrite
  option on NAT rules. NAT rewrite is frequently required when doing NAT between
  IPv4 and IPv6 networks (NAT64/46).
* esmtp —(TCP port 25.) Extended Simple Mail Transfer
  Protocol. ESMTP inspection detects attacks, including spam, phising, malformed
  message attacks, and buffer overflow/underflow attacks. It also provides
  support for application security and protocol conformance, which enforces the
  sanity of the ESMTP messages as well as block senders/receivers, and block mail
  relay. For details on the controls applied during inspection, use the
  show
  running-config all policy-map  command and look for the
  “policy-map type inspect esmtp \_default\_esmtp\_map” line and subsequent
  parameters.

  ESMTP application inspection controls and reduces the commands
  that the user can use as well as the messages that the server returns. It
  provides NAT services and protocol conformance. ESMTP inspection performs three
  primary tasks:

  + Restricts SMTP requests to seven basic SMTP commands and eight
    extended commands. Supported commands are the following:

    Extended SMTP—AUTH, EHLO, ETRN, HELP, SAML, SEND, SOML,
    STARTTLS, and VRFY.

    SMTP (RFC 821)—DATA, HELO, MAIL, NOOP, QUIT, RCPT, RSET.
  + Monitors the SMTP command-response sequence.
  + Generates an audit trail. Syslog audit record 108002 is
    generated when an invalid character embedded in the mail address is replaced.
    For more information, see RFC 821.
* ftp —(TCP port 21.) File Transfer Protocol.
  Inspection provides pinhole and NAT services.
* h323\_h225 —(TCP port 1720, UDP port 1718.) H.323
  inspection supports RAS, H.225, and H.245, and its functionality translates all
  embedded IP addresses and ports. It performs state tracking and filtering.
  H.323 inspection provides support for H.323 compliant applications such as
  Cisco CallManager. H.323 is a suite of protocols defined by the International
  Telecommunication Union for multimedia conferences over LANs. The device
  supports H.323 through Version 6, including H.323 v3 feature Multiple Calls on
  One Call Signaling Channel.

  The two major functions of H.323 inspection are as follows:

  + NAT the necessary embedded IPv4 addresses in the H.225 and H.245
    messages. Because H.323 messages are encoded in PER encoding format, the ASA
    uses an ASN.1 decoder to decode the H.323 messages.
  + Dynamically allocate the negotiated H.245 and RTP/RTCP
    connections. The H.225 connection can also be dynamically allocated when using
    RAS.
* h323\_ras —(UDP ports 1718-1719.) See the
  description for
  h323\_h225 . This inspection is for RAS signaling.
* icmp —(ICMP traffic only.) The ICMP inspection
  engine allows ICMP traffic to have a “session” so it can be inspected like TCP
  and UDP traffic. Without the ICMP inspection engine, we recommend that you do
  not allow ICMP through the device (block with an access control rule). Without
  stateful inspection, ICMP can be used to attack your network. The ICMP
  inspection engine ensures that there is only one response for each request, and
  that the sequence number is correct. Inspection also provides NAT services.
* icmp\_error —(ICMP traffic only.) When ICMP Error
  inspection is enabled, the device creates translation sessions for intermediate
  hops that send ICMP error messages, based on the NAT configuration. The device
  overwrites the packet with the translated IP addresses. This is necessary to
  provide meaningful information in traceroutes that go through the device.
* ip-options —(RSVP traffic only.) IP Options
  inspection controls which IP packets are allowed based on the contents of the
  IP Options field in the packet header. Packets with the Router Alert option are
  allowed. Packets with any other options are dropped.
* netbios —(UDP source ports 137, 138.) NetBIOS Name
  Server over IP. NetBIOS application inspection performs NAT for the embedded IP
  address in the NetBIOS name service (NBNS) packets and NetBIOS datagram
  services packets. It also enforces protocol conformance, checking the various
  count and length fields for consistency.
* rsh —(TCP port 514.) The RSH protocol uses a TCP
  connection from the RSH client to the RSH server on TCP port 514. The client
  and server negotiate the TCP port number where the client listens for the
  STDERR output stream. RSH inspection opens pinholes and supports NAT of the
  negotiated port number if necessary.
* rtsp —(TCP port 554.) Real-Time Streaming Protocol.
  The RTSP inspection engine lets the device pass RTSP packets. RTSP is used by
  RealAudio, RealNetworks, Apple QuickTime, RealPlayer, and Cisco IP/TV
  connections. RTSP applications use the well-known port 554 with TCP (rarely
  UDP) as a control channel. The device only supports TCP, in conformity with RFC
  2326. This TCP control channel is used to negotiate the data channels that are
  used to transmit audio/video traffic, depending on the transport mode that is
  configured on the client. The supported RDT transports are: rtp/avp,
  rtp/avp/udp, x-real-rdt, x-real-rdt/udp, and x-pn-tng/udp.
* sqlnet —(TCP port 1521.) The inspection engine
  supports SQL\*Net versions 1 and 2, but only the Transparent Network Substrate
  (TNS) format. Inspection does not support the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) format.
  SQL\*Net messages are scanned for embedded addresses and ports, and NAT rewrite
  is applied when necessary.

  Disable SQL\*Net inspection when SQL data transfer occurs on the
  same port as the SQL control TCP port 1521. The security appliance acts as a
  proxy when SQL\*Net inspection is enabled and reduces the client window size
  from 65000 to about 16000 causing data transfer issues.
* sip —(TCP/UDP port 5060.) Session Initiation
  Protocol. SIP is a widely used protocol for Internet conferencing, telephony,
  presence, events notification, and instant messaging. Partially because of its
  text-based nature and partially because of its flexibility, SIP networks are
  subject to a large number of security threats. SIP application inspection
  provides address translation in message header and body, dynamic opening of
  ports and basic sanity checks.
* skinny —(TCP port 2000.) Skinny Client Control
  Protocol (SCCP). SCCP (Skinny) application inspection performs translation of
  embedded IP address and port numbers within the packet data, and dynamic
  opening of pinholes. It also performs additional protocol conformance checks
  and basic state tracking.
* sunrpc —(TCP/UDP port 111.) Sun RPC is used by NFS
  and NIS. Sun RPC services can run on any port. When a client attempts to access
  a Sun RPC service on a server, it must learn the port that service is running
  on. It does this by querying the port mapper process, usually rpcbind, on the
  well-known port of 111.

  The client sends the Sun RPC program number of the service and
  the port mapper process responds with the port number of the service. The
  client sends its Sun RPC queries to the server, specifying the port identified
  by the port mapper process. When the server replies, the device intercepts this
  packet and opens both embryonic TCP and UDP connections on that port. NAT or
  PAT of Sun RPC payload information is not supported.
* tftp —(UDP port 69.) Trivial File Transfer
  Protocol. The inspection engine inspects TFTP read request (RRQ), write request
  (WRQ), and error notification (ERROR), and dynamically creates connections and
  translations, if necessary, to permit file transfer between a TFTP client and
  server.

  A dynamic secondary channel and a PAT translation, if necessary,
  are allocated on a reception of a valid read (RRQ) or write (WRQ) request. This
  secondary channel is subsequently used by TFTP for file transfer or error
  notification. Only the TFTP server can initiate traffic over the secondary
  channel, and at most one incomplete secondary channel can exist between the
  TFTP client and server. An error notification from the server closes the
  secondary channel. TFTP inspection must be enabled if static PAT is used to
  redirect TFTP traffic.
* xdmcp —(UDP port 177.) X Display Manager Control
  Protocol. XDMCP is a protocol that uses UDP port 177 to negotiate X sessions,
  which use TCP when established. For successful negotiation and start of an
  XWindows session, the device must allow the TCP back connection from the
  Xhosted computer. Use access control rules to permit the back connection
  through the TCP ports.

  During the XWindows session, the manager talks to the display
  Xserver on the well-known port 6000 | n. Each display has a separate connection
  to the Xserver, as a result of the following terminal setting:
  setenv DISPLAY Xserver:n , where
  n  is the display number.

  When XDMCP is used, the display is negotiated using IP
  addresses, which the device can NAT if needed. XDCMP inspection does not
  support PAT.

## Examples

The following example shows the current inspection configuration
and disables XDMCP inspection. You can enable or disable inspection engines,
but you cannot change their default behavior. For example, this output shows
that DNS/TCP inspection is disabled. You cannot configure DNS inspection to
apply to TCP traffic using the
configure
inspection  command.

RAM disk to improve system performance and reduce disk wear associated with
writing connection events to the Solid State Drive (SSD), use the
configure
log-events-to-ramdisk  command.

configure log-events-to-ramdisk`{` enable `|`disable`}`

## Syntax Description

| enable | Enables connection event logging to RAM disk. |
| --- | --- |
| disable | Disables connection event logging to RAM disk. Connection events are then logged to the SSD. |

### Command Default

The default is enabled on the platforms that
support the feature.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to toggle between using RAM
disk or a physical SSD to log connection events. If enabled, connection events
are logged to RAM disk. If disabled, connection events are logged to the SSD.
In the event of a power loss, connection events logged to RAM disk will be
lost.

This command is not available on all device types. When you run this
command on an unsupported platform, the system returns the following message:

```

This command is not available on this platform.

```

## Examples

The following example disables RAM disk logging.

```

> configure log-events-to-ramdisk disable

```

## configure manager add

To configure the device to accept a connection from or initiate a connection to the management center or Security Cloud Control, use the configure manager add  command.

| **Caution** | ---   Adding a remote manager resets the configuration to the factory default.   --- |
| --- | --- |

IPv4\_address
 `|`
IPv6\_address
 `|`

 `[`
nat\_id
`]`
 `[`

## Syntax Description

| hostname | Specifies the hostname of the management center. |
| --- | --- |
| IPv4\_address | Specifies the IPv4 address of the management center. |
| IPv6\_address | Specifies the IPv6 address of the management center. |
| display\_name | Provide a display name for showing this manager with the show managers  command. This option is useful if you are identifying Security Cloud Control as the primary manager and an on-prem management center for analytics only. If you don't specify this argument, the firewall auto-generates a display name using one of the following methods:   * hostname | IP\_address  (if you don't use the DONTRESOLVE  keyword) * manager-timestamp |
| DONTRESOLVE | If the management center is not directly addressable, use DONTRESOLVE . If you use DONTRESOLVE , then a nat\_id   is required. When you add this device to the management center, make sure that you specify both the device IP address and the nat\_id  ; one side of the connection needs to specify an IP address, and both sides need to specify the same, unique NAT ID. |
| regkey | Specifies the unique alphanumeric registration key required to register a device to the management center. Alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-) are allowed. |
| nat\_id | Specifies an alphanumeric string used during the registration process between the management center and the device when one side does not specify an IP address. Specify the same NAT ID on the management center. If you use a data interface for management, then you must specify the NAT ID on both the threat defense and management center for registration. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |
| 7.2 | Added support for multiple managers: a primary cloud-delivered management center (Security Cloud Control) and an on-prem management center for analytics only. |

### Usage Guidelines

A unique alphanumeric registration key is always required to
register a device to the management center.

Normally, you need both IP addresses: the management center specifies the device IP address, and the device specifies the management center IP address. However, if you only know one of the IP addresses, then you must also
specify a unique NAT ID on both sides of the connection to establish trust for the
initial communication and to look up the correct registration key. If you do not
know the management center IP address, then use the DONTRESOLVE  keyword instead of
the IP address or hostname.

| **Note** | ---   If you use a data interface for management, then you must specify the NAT ID on both the threat defense and management center for registration.   --- |

If you registered a management center and a device using IPv4 and want to convert them to IPv6, you must delete and
re-register the device on the management center.

To change from management center to the local device manager, use the configure manager delete  command, and then use
the configure manager local  command.

| **Note** | ---   Before moving a device from one management center to another or changing to the local manager, delete it from the current management center.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

```

> configure manager add DONTRESOLVE abc123 efg456

```

configure manager delete

identifier

## Syntax Description

| identifier | If you have more than one manager defined, you need to specify the identifier (also known as the UUID; see the show managers  command). Delete each manager entry separately. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |
| 6.3 | The check for high availability mode was added. |
| 7.2 | The identifier  variable was added for when you have multiple managers configured. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to remove the current device manager(s). The device is placed in No Manager Mode,
where you can then either add a remote manager (management center) or use the local manager (device manager). You would use this command when switching between local and remote management,
or when a remote manager is no longer active.

If the device is configured for high availability, you must
first break the high availability configuration using the device manager (if
possible) or the
configurehigh-availabilitydisable  command. Ideally, break HA from the active
unit.

The command behavior differs based on the current manager.

* Remote—The management center cannot be reachable. If the management center is still communicating with the threat
  defense, first remove the device from the management center’s inventory. Then you can use this command.
* Local—No restrictions. You are immediately moved to No Manager
  Mode.

## Examples

The following example removes the current manager and enters No
Manager Mode.

```

> configure manager delete

If you enabled any feature licenses, you must disable them in
Firepower Device Manager before deleting the local manager.
Otherwise, those licenses remain assigned to the device in
Cisco Smart Software Manager.

| configure manager local | Configures a local manager. |
| show managers | Shows the current manager. |

## configure manager edit

To edit the management center IP address in the threat
defense configuration, use the configure manager edit  command.

configure manager edit

identifier
 `{`
hostname
 `{`
ip\_address
 `|`
hostname
`} |`
displayname

display\_name
`}`

## Syntax Description

| identifier | Specifies the identifier (UUID) of the management center. Use the show managers  command to view the identifier (7.2 or later) or obtain the UUID from the management center CLI show version  command. |
| --- | --- |
| hostname  {ip\_address | hostname} | Changes the hostname/IP address. |
| displaynamedisplay\_name | Changes the display name. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.7 | This command was introduced. |
| 7.2 | Added the hostname  and displayname  keywords. |

### Usage Guidelines

If you change the management center IP address or hostname, you should also change the value at the device CLI so the configurations match. Although in most
cases, the management connection will be reestablished without changing the management center IP address or hostname on the device, in at least one case, you must perform this task for the connection to be reestablished:
when you added the device to the management center and you specified the NAT ID only. Even in other cases, we recommend keeping the management center IP address or hostname up to date for extra network resiliency.

If the management center was originally identified by DONTRESOLVE  and a NAT ID, you can change the value to a hostname or IP address using this command. You cannot change an IP address or
hostname to DONTRESOLVE .

The management connection will go down, and then reestablish. You can monitor the
state of the connection using the sftunnel-status
command.

## Examples

The management center UUID definitively identifies the management center; for example, in the case of management center High Availability, you need to specify the active management center on the threat
defense device.

Enter the show managers  command to
view the identifier:

```

> show managers
Type                      : Manager
Host                      : 10.10.1.4
Display name              : 10.10.1.4
Identifier                : f7ffad78-bf16-11ec-a737-baa2f76ef602
Registration              : Completed
Management type           : Configuration

```

Once you obtain the UUID, you can edit the IP address on the threat
defense device. For example:

```

> configure manager edit f7ffad78-bf16-11ec-a737-baa2f76ef602 hostname 10.10.5.1

```

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to enable the local manager, device manager. Use the local manager when you do not want to use a separate management center. By enabling the local manager, you can open the device manager using a browser at http://management\_ip\_address .

| **Note** | ---   It can take up to 4-6 minutes for the command to complete, because the system must reinitialize its database. Please be patient.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The local manager is available for most platforms starting with 6.5. If it is not
available for your platform, configure a remote manager using the configure manager add  command.

### Additional Restrictions

* The device must be in No Manager Mode before you can switch to
  the local manager. Use the
  configure manager delete  command to enter No
  Manager Mode. Use the
  show
  managers  command to determine your current manager.
* The device cannot be operating in transparent firewall mode (see
  the
  configure firewall  command). The local manager
  supports routed mode only.

## configure network dns searchdomains

To configure the list of DNS search domains, use the
configure network dns
searchdomains  command.

configure network dns searchdomains `[` dnslist`]`

## Syntax Description

| dnslist | Specifies a comma-separated list of DNS search domains. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to replace the current list of DNS search
domains with a new list. These domains are add to hostnames when you do not
specify a fully-qualified domain name in a command, for example,
ping system .
The domains are use on the management interface, or for commands that go
through the management interface, only.

If the device is a unit in a
locally-managed high availability group, your change will be overwritten the
next time the active unit deploys configuration updates. If this is the active
unit, your change will be propagated to the peer during deployment.

## Examples

The following example configures a new search domains list and
then ping’s a hostname that is not fully-qualified.

```

> configure network dns searchdomains example.com
> show dns system
search example.com
nameserver 10.163.47.11
> ping system www
PING www.example.com (10.163.4.161) 56(84) bytes of data.

## configure network dns servers

To configure the DNS servers for the management interface, use
the
configure network dns
servers  command.

## Syntax Description

| dnslist | Specifies a comma-separated list of DNS servers. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to replace the current list of DNS servers with
a new list. The servers are used on the management interface only. They cannot
resolve fully-qualified domain names for commands that go through the data
interfaces.

Starting with version 6.3, for locally-managed devices only, if the data and management interfaces are using the same DNS
group, the group is updated on your next deployment from the manager, which means that the changes are also applied to the
DNS group used on the data interfaces. The changes for the management interface are immediate. We recommend that you make
all DNS changes from the local manager rather than use this command.

If the device is a unit in a
locally-managed high availability group, your change will be overwritten the
next time the active unit deploys configuration updates. If this is the active
unit, your change will be propagated to the peer during deployment.

## Examples

The following example configures the DNS servers for the
management interface.

```

> configure network dns servers 10.163.47.11,10.124.1.10
> show dns system
search example.com
nameserver 10.163.47.11

## configure network hostname

To configure the hostname for the device’s management interface,
use the
configure network
hostname  command.

configure network
hostnamename

## Syntax Description

| name | Specifies the new hostname. This name can be up to 63 characters. The hostname must start and end with a letter or digit, and have only letters, digits, or a hyphen. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The system hostname is defined in more than one place. If you update the hostname from the manager, the system synchronizes
the hostname across all processes. If you use this command when using device manager (the local manager), you need to deploy changes from device manager to complete the update so that the same name is used by all system processes.

If the unit is part of a high-availability group, the name applies to the current device only for all processes except Lina.
For the Lina process, the name is synchronized on both units, so you should see the same hostname in the prompt when access
the diagnostic CLI (using system support diagnostic-cli ).

| **Note** | ---   If you configure the management interface to obtain its address using DHCP, and you configure the DHCP server to provide the hostname using Option 12, do not use this command to change the hostname. Instead, update the name in Option 12 on the DHCP server. Using this command in conjunction with Option 12 can leave the system with inconsistent hostnames across various processes.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following example sets the hostname to sfrocks.

```

> configure network hostname sfrocks

```

| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |
| 6.6 | This command now works for a locally-managed system. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to set up an HTTP Proxy address for the device.
After issuing the command, you are prompted for the HTTP proxy address and
port, whether proxy authentication is required, and if it is required, the
proxy username, proxy password, and confirmation of the proxy password.

## Examples

The following example configures an HTTP proxy for the
management interface. In this example, authentication is configured. The CLI
does not display the password that you type.

```

> configure network http-proxy
Manual proxy configuration
Enter HTTP Proxy address: 10.100.10.10
Enter HTTP Proxy Port: 80

## configure network ipv4 delete

To disable the IPv4 configuration of the device’s management
interface, use the
configure network ipv4
delete  command.

configure network ipv4
delete `[` management\_interface`]`

## Syntax Description

| management\_ interface | Specifies the management interface. If you do not specify an interface, this command configures the default management interface. This parameter is needed only if you use the configure management-interface  commands to enable more than one management interface. Multiple management interfaces are supported on Firepower 4100 and 9300 series devices only. Do not specify this parameter for other platforms. The management interface IDs on the Firepower 4100 and 9300 are management0  for the default management interface and management1  for the optional event interface. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to disable the IPv4 configuration of the
device’s management interface. If you are connected to the IP address you
delete, you will lose your connection to the device. Ensure that you have an
IPv6 address configured before removing the IPv4 address.

You do not need to delete the configuration to change the IPv4
address. Use the
configure network ipv4
manual  or
configure network ipv4
dhcp  commands if you want to keep IPv4 addressing but you simply
want to change the address.

## Examples

The following example deletes the IPv4 address configuration.

```

> configure network ipv4 delete

```

## configure network ipv4 dhcp

To configure the management interface to obtain an IPv4 address
from a DHCP server, use the
configure network ipv4
dhcp  command.

configure network ipv4
dhcp `[` management\_interface`]`

## Syntax Description

| management\_ interface | Specifies the management interface. DHCP is supported only on the default management interface, so you do not need to use this argument. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to specify that the device’s management
interface receives its IPv4 configuration from a DHCP server. The management
interface communicates with the DHCP server to obtain its configuration
information.

| **Note** | ---   If you configure a data interface for management center access using the configure network management-data-interface  command, you cannot use DHCP for the Management interface; you must set a manual IP address because the default route, which must be data-interfaces, might be overwritten with one received from the DHCP server. Although you do not plan to use the Management interface, you must set an IP address, for example, a private address. This IP address is NATted when the traffic is forwarded to the data interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following example configures the management interface to
obtain its IPv4 address using DHCP.

```

> configure network ipv4 dhcp

```

### Usage Guidelines

You must enter both the IPv4 and IPv6 versions of this command to restore the
configuration to the factory default, even if you did not identify an IP address for
one of the versions.

## Examples

The following example restores the default configuration for the
management interface.

```

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.2 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

If there is an active DHCP server on the management interface,
you can disable it. When disabled, clients on the management network will
either have to configure static addresses, or you will need to configure a
different device on the network to provide DHCP server services.

If you change the management IP address to use DHCP to obtain an
address, the DHCP server (if enabled) is automatically disabled.

## Examples

The following example shows how to check whether DHCP server is
enabled, and then how to disable it.

```

> show network-dhcp-server
DHCP Server Enabled
192.168.45.46-192.168.45.254

configure network ipv4
dhcp-server-enable  command.

configure network ipv4
dhcp-server-enablestart\_ip\_addressend\_ip\_address

## Syntax Description

| start\_ip\_address end\_ip\_address | Specifies the starting and ending IPv4 addresses for the DHCP address pool. When the management interface receives a DHCP client request, it provides an address from this pool. The pool must be on the same subnet as the management IPv4 address.  Do not include the network address, management address, or broadcast address in the DHCP address pool. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.2 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

If you configure a manual (static) IPv4 address for the
management interface, you can configure a DHCP server to supply addresses to
endpoints on the management network.

Before enabling the server, ensure that there is no other DHCP
server on the management network. You can have at most one DHCP server per
network, or results can be unpredictable.

| **Note** | ---   This command is not supported on threat defense virtual devices.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following example shows how to configure the DHCP server and
show its status.

```

> configure network ipv4 dhcp-server-enable 192.168.45.46 192.168.45.254
DHCP Server Enabled
> show network-dhcp-server
DHCP Server Enabled
192.168.45.46-192.168.45.254

```

## configure network ipv4 manual

To configure a static IPv4 address on the management interface,
use the
configure network ipv4
manual  command.

configure network ipv4
manualipaddrnetmaskgw`[` management\_interface`]`

## Syntax Description

| ipaddr | Specifies the IP address. |
| --- | --- |
| netmask | Specifies the subnet mask. |
| gw | Specifies the IPv4 address of the default gateway.  You have the option of specifying data-interfaces , which uses the data interfaces on the device as a gateway instead of an explicit gateway on the management network. Use the data interfaces if you do not want to wire the management physical interface to a separate management network. For management center data interface management, see the configure network management-data-interface  command.  Note that the gw  in this command is used to create the default route for the device. If you configure an event-only interface, then you must enter the gw  as part of the command; however, this entry just configures the default route to the value you specify and does not create a separate static route for the eventing interface. If you are using an event-only interface on a different network from the management interface, we recommend that you set the gw  for use with the management interface, and then create a static route separately for the event-only interface using the configure network static-routes  command. |
| management\_ interface | Specifies the management interface. If you do not specify an interface, this command configures the default management interface. This parameter is needed only if you use the configure management-interface  commands to enable more than one management interface. Multiple management interfaces are supported on Firepower 4100 and 9300 series devices only. Do not specify this parameter for other platforms. The management interface IDs on the Firepower 4100 and 9300 are management0  for the default management interface and management1  for the optional event interface. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |
| 6.2 | The data-interfaces  keyword was added for gateway. |
| 6.7 | The data-interfaces  keyword is now available for the management center management on a data interface. |

### Usage Guidelines

If you configure a data interface for the management center access using the configure network management-data-interface  command, you must set a manual IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6). Although you do not plan to use the Management interface,
you must set an IP address, for example, a private address. This IP address is NATted when the traffic is forwarded to the
data interface. You cannot use DHCP (the default) because the default route, which must be data-interfaces, might be overwritten with one received from the DHCP server.

## Examples

The following example configures a static IPv4 address on the
management interface.

```

> configure network ipv4 manual 10.123.1.10 255.255.0.0 10.123.1.1

```

## configure network ipv6 delete

To disable the IPv6 configuration of the device’s management
interface, use the
configure network ipv4
delete  command.

configure network ipv6
delete `[` management\_interface`]`

## Syntax Description

| management\_ interface | Specifies the management interface. If you do not specify an interface, this command configures the default management interface. This parameter is needed only if you use the configure management-interface  commands to enable more than one management interface. Multiple management interfaces are supported on Firepower 4100 and 9300 series devices only. Do not specify this parameter for other platforms. The management interface IDs on the Firepower 4100 and 9300 are management0  for the default management interface and management1  for the optional event interface. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to disable the IPv6 configuration of the
device’s management interface. If you are connected to the IP address you
delete, you will lose your connection to the device. Ensure that you have an
IPv4 address configured before removing the IPv6 address.

You do not need to delete the configuration to change the IPv6
address. Use the
configure network ipv6 {manual |
dhcp |
router}  commands if you want to keep IPv6
addressing but you simply want to change the address.

## Examples

The following example deletes the IPv6 address configuration.

```

## Syntax Description

| ipv4 | Specifies IPv4 for the IP address. You can reenter this command to make changes to the IPv4 address. |
| --- | --- |
| ipv6 | Specifies IPv6 for the IP address. You cannot reenter this command with the ipv6  argument to make changes to the address. Instead, you must first delete the IPv6 address and other settings using configure network management-data-interface disable  and then re-enter the command. |
| dhcp | Specifies DHCP for the IPv4 address. |
| manualip\_address netmask-or-prefix | Specifies a manual IP address and netmask or prefix. |
| default-gwgateway\_ip | Specifies the address of the default gateway.  If you edit the secondary interface at the CLI, you cannot configure the gateway or otherwise alter the default route, because the static route for this interface can only be edited in the management center. |
| ddns update-urlhttps://username:password@provider-domain/path?hostname=<h>&myip=<a> | Specifies the DDNS Web type update URL. Specify the username and password at the DDNS provider. Check with your DDNS provider for the correct path. Before entering the question mark (?) character, press the control (Ctrl) key and the v key together on your keyboard. This will allow you to enter the ? without the software interpreting the ? as a help query.  Although these keywords look like arguments, you need to enter this text verbatim at the end of the URL. The threat defense will automatically replace the <h> and <a> fields with the hostname and IP address when it sends the DDNS update. |
| nameifname | Sets the name of the interface. |
| clientip\_address | Limits data interface access to an management center on a specific network. Note that this keyword is not part of the wizard when you enter the configure network managament-data-interface  command without arguments. |
| interfaceid | Specifies the data interface ID that you want to use for management center management access. You can only specify one data interface for management center access. |
| disable | Disables management center management access on a data interface. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |

| 6.7 | This command was introduced. |
| 7.3 | After you add a secondary management interface in the management center, you can edit some of its settings at the CLI using this command. |
| 7.4 | High Availability support was added. |

### Usage Guidelines

If you do not specify any arguments when you first configure this command, you are
prompted with a wizard to configure basic network settings for the data
interface.

| **Note** | ---   You should use the console port when using this command. If you use SSH to the Management interface, you might get disconnected and have to reconnect to the console port. See below for more information about SSH usage.  You can re-enter this command to change the IPv4 address, but you cannot change the IPv6 address. Instead, you must first delete the IPv6 address and other settings using configure network management-data-interface disable  and then re-enter the command.   --- |
| --- | --- |

If you configure a secondary management interface in the management center, you can edit it using this command. You cannot manually add the secondary
interface at the CLI; you must use the management center.

See the following details for using this command:

* The original Management interface cannot use DHCP if you want to use a data
  interface for management. If you did not set the IP address manually during
  initial setup, you can set it now using the configure
  network {ipv4 | ipv6}
  manual  command. If you did not already set the
  Management interface gateway to data-interfaces, this
  command will set it now.
* management center access from a data interface has the following limitations:

  + You can only enable manager access on a physical, data interface.
    You cannot use a subinterface or EtherChannel, nor can you create a
    subinterface on the manager access interface.
    You can also use the management center to enable manager access on a single secondary interface for
    redundancy.
  + This interface cannot be management-only.
  + Routed firewall mode only, using a routed interface.
  + PPPoE is not supported. If your ISP requires PPPoE, you will have to put a
    router with PPPoE support between the threat
    defense and the WAN modem.
  + The interface must be in the global VRF only.
  + SSH is not enabled by default for data interfaces, so you will have to enable
    SSH later using the management center. Because the Management interface gateway will be changed to be the data
    interfaces, you also cannot SSH to the Management interface from a remote
    network unless you add a static route for the Management interface using the
    configure network static-routes  command.
    For threat
    defense virtual on Amazon Web Services, a console port is not available, so you
    should maintain your SSH access to the Management interface: add a
    static route for Management before you continue with your configuration.
    Alternatively, be sure to finish all CLI configuration (including the
    configure manager add  command) before
    you configure the data interface for manager access and you are
    disconnected.
  + You cannot use separate management and event-only
    interfaces.
  + Clustering is not supported. You must use the Management interface in this
    case.
* For high availability:

  + Use the same data interface on both devices for manager access.
  + Redundant manager access data
    interface is not supported.
  + You cannot use DHCP; only a static IP address is supported. Features that
    rely on DHCP cannot be used, including DDNS and zero-touch provisioning.
  + Have different static IP addresses in the same subnet.
  + Use either IPv4 or IPv6; you cannot set both.
  + Use the same manager configuration (configure manager
    add  command) to ensure that the connectivity is the
    same.
  + You cannot use the data interface as the failover or state link.
* When you add the threat
  defense to the management center, the management center discovers and maintains the interface configuration, including the
  following settings: interface name and IP address, static route to the
  gateway, DNS servers, and DDNS server. For more information about the DNS
  server configuration, see below. In management center, you can later make changes to the management center access interface configuration, but make sure you don't make changes that
  can prevent the threat
  defense or management center from re-establishing the management connection. If the management
  connection is disrupted, the threat
  defense includes the configure policy rollback  command
  to restore the previous deployment.
* If you configure a DDNS server update URL, the threat
  defense automatically adds certificates for all of the major CAs from the Cisco
  Trusted Root CA bundle so that the threat
  defense can validate the DDNS server certificate for the HTTPS connection. The
  threat
  defense supports any DDNS server that uses the DynDNS Remote API specification
  ([https://help.dyn.com/remote-access-api/).](https://help.dyn.com/remote-access-api/)
* This command sets the *data* interface DNS server. The Management DNS
  server that you set with the setup script (or using the
  configure network dns servers  command) is
  used for management traffic. The data DNS server is used for DDNS (if
  configured) or for security policies applied to this interface.

  On the management center, the data interface DNS servers are configured in the Platform Settings
  policy that you assign to this threat
  defense. When you add the threat
  defense to the management center, the local setting is maintained, and the DNS servers are *not*
  added to a Platform Settings policy. However, if you later assign a Platform
  Settings policy to the threat
  defense that includes a DNS configuration, then that configuration will overwrite
  the local setting. We suggest that you actively configure the DNS Platform
  Settings to match this setting to bring the management center and the threat
  defense into sync.

  Also, local DNS servers are only retained by management center if the DNS servers were discovered at initial registration. For example,
  if you registered the device using the Management interface, but then later
  configure a data interface using the configure network
  management-data-interface  command, then you must
  manually configure all of these settings in management center, including the DNS servers, to match the threat
  defense configuration.
* You can change the management interface after you register the threat
  defense to the management center, to either the Management interface or another data interface.
* The FQDN that you set in the setup wizard will be used for this
  interface.
* You can clear the entire device configuration as part of the command; you
  might use this option in a recovery scenario, but we do not suggest you use
  it for initial setup or normal operation.
* To disable data managemement, enter the configure network
  management-data-interface disable  command.

| mtu-event-channel [bytes] | Sets the MTU of the eventing interface in bytes, between 64 and 9000 if you enable IPv4, and 1280 to 9000 if you enable IPv6. If you enable both IPv4 and IPv6, then the minimum is 1280. If you do not enter the bytes , you are prompted for a value. This command is equivalent to the configure network mtu  command. |
| mtu-management-channel [bytes] | Sets the MTU of the management interface in bytes, between 64 and 1500 if you enable IPv4, and 1280 to 1500 if you enable IPv6. If you enable both IPv4 and IPv6, then the minimum is 1280. If you do not enter the bytes , you are prompted for a value. This command is equivalent to the configure network mtu  command.   | **Note** | If you set a *very* low MTU, device manager performance can be affected. | | --- | --- | |

### Command Default

The management0 interface is enabled, and used for both event and management traffic. management1 is disabled.

The default TCP port is 8305.

The default MTU is 1500 for both management and
eventing.

The default FEC for 25Gbps is auto.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |
| 6.6 | We added the mtu-event-channel  and mtu-management-channel  keywords. |
| 7.4 | We added the fec  keyword for the Secure Firewall 4200 management interfaces when running at 25Gbps. |

### Usage Guidelines

For device management, the management center management interface carries two separate traffic channels: the management
traffic channel carries all internal traffic (such as inter-device traffic specific
to the management of the device), and the event traffic channel carries all event
traffic (such as web events).

You can optionally configure a separate event-only interface on
the management center to handle event traffic from separate event interfaces on devices, if available
(see the management center web interface do perform this configuration). You can only configure one
event-only interface. Event traffic can use a large amount of bandwidth, so
separating event traffic from management traffic can improve the performance of the
management center.

Event traffic is sent between the device event interface and
the management center event interface if possible. If the event network goes down, then event traffic
reverts to the default management interface. Separate event interfaces are used when
possible, but the management interface is always the backup.

On the Firepower 4100/9300, the mgmt-type interface that you assign to the logical device is
designated as the default management0 interface in the threat
defense application. You can also configure a separate eventing-type interface,
management1. After you assign the event interface to the logical device, this
interface is not enabled or configured with network settings. You must access the
threat
defense CLI and use the configure network management-interface
command to enable it. Then use the configure
network {ipv4 | ipv6} manual  commands to configure the address(es) for this
interface.

The Secure Firewall 4200 includes two management
interfaces, one of which can be used for management, and the other for events.

To configure a management1 event interface, enable the interface and then disable management
events on the interface. You can optionally disable events for the management0
interface. In either case, the device will try to send events on the event-only
interface, and if that interface is down, it will send events on the management0
interface even if you disable the event channel.

## Examples

The following example enables management1, and disables the management
channel. By default, both channels are enabled.

```

> configure network management-interface enable management1
> configure network management-interface disable-management-channel management1
>

```

The following example changes the port used for communications with the management center.

```

> configure network management-interface tcpport 8306
Management port changed to 8306.

```

The following example sets the MTU on
the eventing interface to 9000.

```

> configure network management-interface mtu-event-channel 9000
MTU set successfully to 9000 from 1500 for management1
Refreshing Network Config...
Interface management1 speed is set to '10000baseT/Full'
>

```

The following example sets the MTU on
the management interface to 1400 using the CLI prompts.

```

> configure network management-interface mtu-management-channel
Do you want to change the MTU [1500] for management0 interface?(Yes/No): Yes
Enter the new value for MTU [1500]> 1400
MTU set successfully to 1400 from 1500 for management0
Refreshing Network Config...
Interface management0 speed is set to '10000baseT/Full'
>

```

| netmask\_or\_prefix | The network address mask for IPv4, or prefix for IPv6. The IPv4 netmask must be in dotted decimal format, for example, 255.255.255.0. The IPv6 prefix is a standard prefix number, such as 96. |
| gateway | The gateway address to add or remove, in IPv4 or IPv6 format as appropriate. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.0.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

If you configure an event-only interface using the configure network management-interface  commands, you need to configure a static route if this interface is on a separate network from the management interface.
Static routes do not affect through-the-box traffic, i.e. traffic on data interfaces. Without static routes, all management
traffic uses the default route specified as the gateway for the default management interface. You typically do not need static
routes when using a single management interface, or if the event-only interface is on the same network.

| **Note** | ---   For the *default* route, do not use this command; you can only change the default route gateway IP address when you use the configure network ipv4  or ipv6  commands for the default management interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following example adds an IPv4 static route for management interface management1 , using a destination address of 10.115.24.0 , a network address mask of 255.255.255.0 , and a gateway address of 10.115.9.2 :

```

> configure network static-routes ipv4 add management1 10.115.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.115.9.2

```

The following example adds an IPv6 static route for management interface management1 , using a destination address of 2001:db8::201 , an IPv6 prefix length of 64 , and a gateway address of 2001:db8::3657 .

```

> configure network static-routes ipv6 add management1 2001:db8::201 64 2001:db8::3657

```

The following example shows how to delete a static route.

```

> show network-static-routes
---------------[ IPv4 Static Routes ]---------------
Interface                 : management1
Destination               : 10.1.1.0

## configure policy rollback

To roll back the configuration on the threat
defense to the last-deployed configuration, use the configure policy rollback  command.

configure policy rollback

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.7 | This command was introduced. |
| 7.2 | Rollback is supported for high availability. |

### Usage Guidelines

If you use a data interface on the threat
defense for management center management (see the configure network management-data-interface  command), and you deploy a configuration change from the management center that affects the network connectivity, you can roll back the configuration on the threat
defense to the last-deployed configuration so you can restore management connectivity. You can then adjust the configuration settings
in management center so that the network connectivity is maintained, and re-deploy. You can use the rollback feature even if you do not lose connectivity;
it is not limited to this troubleshooting situation.

See the following guidelines:

* Only the previous deployment is available locally on the threat
  defense; you cannot roll back to any earlier deployments.
* Rollback is supported for high availability from management center 7.2 onwards.
* Rollback is not supported for clustering deployments.
* The rollback only affects configurations that you can set in management center. For example, the rollback does not affect any local configuration related to the dedicated Management interface, which you
  can only configure at the threat
  defense CLI. Note that if you changed data interface settings after the last management center deployment using the configure network management-data-interface  command, and then you use the rollback command, those settings will not be preserved; they will roll back to the last-deployed
  management center settings.
* UCAPL/CC mode cannot be rolled back.
* Out-of-band SCEP certificate data that was updated during the previous
  deployment cannot be rolled back.
* During the rollback, connections will drop because the current configuration
  will be cleared.

After the rollback, the threat
defense notifies the management center that the rollback was completed successfully. In management center, the deployment screen will show a banner stating that the configuration was rolled back.

If the rollback failed, refer to <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/firepower-ngfw-virtual/215258-troubleshooting-firepower-threat-defense.html> for common deployment problems. In some cases, the rollback can fail after management center management access is restored; in this case, you can resolve the management center configuration issues, and redeploy from management center.

## Examples

The following example rolls back the last deployed configuration.

```

> configure policy rollback

The last deployment to this FTD was on June 1, 2020 and its status was Successful.
Do you want to continue [Y/N]?

Y

Rolling back complete configuration on the FTD. This will take time.

## Syntax Description

| add | Adds an SSD to the RAID. It can take several hours to complete syncing the new SSD to the RAID, during which the firewall is completely operational. You can even reboot, and the sync will continue after it powers up. |
| --- | --- |
| psid | If you add an SSD that was previously used on another system, and is still locked, enter the psid . The *psid* is printed on the label attached to the back of the SSD. Alternatively, you can reboot the system, and the SSD will be reformatted and added to the RAID. |
| remove | Removes the SSD from the RAID and keeps the data intact. |
| remove-secure | Removes the SSD from the RAID, disables the self-encrypting disk feature, and performs a secure erase of the SSD. |
| local-disk `{` 1 `|`2`}` | Specifies the SSD, disk1 or disk2. |

### Command Default

If you have two SSDs, they form a RAID when you boot up.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 7.1 | This command was introduced for the Secure Firewall 3100. |

### Usage Guidelines

You can perform the following tasks at the threat
defense CLI while the firewall is powered up:

* Hot swap one of the SSDs—If an SSD is faulty, you can replace it. Note that
  if you only have one SSD, you cannot remove it while the firewall is powered
  on.
* Remove one of the SSDs—If you have two SSDs, you can remove one.
* Add a second SSD—If you have one SSD, you can add a second SSD and form a
  RAID.

| **Caution** | ---   Do not remove an SSD without first removing it from the RAID using this procedure. You can cause data loss.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following example removes disk2 from the RAID and performs
a secure erase.

```

> configure raid remove-secure local-disk 2

## configure snort

To configure
advanced behavior for the Snort inspection engine, use the
configure snort
command.

configure snortpreserve-connection `{` enable `|`disable`}`

## Syntax Description

| preserve-connection {enable | disable} | Whether to preserve existing TCP/UDP connections on routed and transparent interfaces in case the Snort process goes down. This option is enabled by default, but you can disable it. When enabled, connections that were already allowed remain established, but new connections cannot be established until Snort is again available. When disabled, all new or existing connections are dropped when Snort goes down.  Non-TCP/UDP connections, such as ICMP pings, are not preserved.  To view the current setting, use the show running-config snort  command. When viewing the entire running configuration, the no  form of the snort preserve-connection  command indicates the feature is disabled. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.2.0.2, 6.2.3 | This command was introduced. However, preserve-connection disable  is not supported with device manager (local management), which re-enables preserve-connection every time it deploys the configuration.  This command is not available when the threat defense or management center is running Version 6.2.1, 6.2.2 , 6.2.2.x, or a version earlier than 6.2.0.2, in which case the device behaves as if the command is disabled, whereby all new or existing connections are dropped when Snort goes down. |

### Usage Guidelines

With
preserve-connection  enabled, if Snort goes down,
any existing connections remain established. When Snort becomes available,
these established connections continue to bypass Snort inspection. Any new
connections that require Snort inspection are dropped until Snort becomes
available again.

## Examples

The following
example disables
preserve-connection .

```

> configure snort preserve-connection disable

```

## configure snort3 memory-monitor

To configure the Snort 3 memory threshold monitoring application, use the configure snort3 memory-monitor  command.

configure snort3 memory-monitor
`[`
disable
 `|`
75-98
`]`

## Syntax Description

| disable | Disables Snort 3 memory threshold monitoring application. |
| --- | --- |
| 75-98 | Sets the percentage of memory threshold for Snort 3. The default value is 95. |

### Command Default

By default, the memory monitoring application is enabled on Snort 3 non-cluster devices with a default threshold of 95%.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 7.4.1, 7.2.6 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use the configure snort3 memory-monitor  command to monitor the used memory of Snort 3 at regular intervals and if the memory crosses a certain threshold, it triggers
a high availability switchover and restarts the local Snort 3 process. By default, the threshold for switchover is set to
95%, which means, if Snort 3 uses 95% of its allocated memory, then corrective action is taken.

## Examples

The following example configures the Snort 3 memory monitoring application threshold to 87%.

```

> configure snort3 memory-monitor 87
Memory monitor for Snort3 is running with threshold set to 87%

```

## configure ssh-access-list

To configure the device to accept SSH connections from specified
IP addresses, use the
configure
ssh-access-list  command.

configure
ssh-access-listaddress\_list

## Syntax Description

| address\_list | A comma separated list of IP addresses for hosts or networks, in IPv4 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation or IPv6 prefix length notation. For example, 10.100.10.0/24 or 2001:DB8::/96.  To specify all IPv4 hosts, enter 0.0.0.0/0. To specify all IPv6 hosts, specify ::/0. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

You must include all supported hosts or networks in a single
command. Addresses specified in this command overwrite the current contents of
the SSH access list.

Merely allowing SSH access does not permit users to log into the
local manager. Access to the configuration software is controlled by username
and password.

If you exclude the IP address from which you are currently
logged into the CLI, your connect will be broken. You will need to change your
IP address to regain entry into the CLI.

If the device is a unit in a
locally-managed high availability group, your change will be overwritten the
next time the active unit deploys configuration updates. If this is the active
unit, your change will be propagated to the peer during deployment.

## Examples

The following example configures the device to accept SSH
connections from any IPv4 or IPv6 address:

```

> configure ssh-access-list 0.0.0.0/0,::/0
The ssh access list was changed successfully.
> show ssh-access-list
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             state NEW tcp dpt:ssh
ACCEPT     tcp      anywhere             anywhere             state NEW tcp dpt:ssh

```

## configure ssh pubkeys create

To generate an SSH keypair (public and private) and to install the public SSH key, use the configure ssh pubkeys create  command.

configure ssh pubkeys create
type
bits
`[`
comment
`]`

## Syntax Description

| type | The key algorithm. The RSA and ECDSA keys are supported. |
| --- | --- |
| bits | Number of bits in the key algorithm. RSA is between 1024 and 16384 (inclusive). ECDSA is one of 256, 384, and 521. |
| comment | Comment for the key. To use spaces in your comments, enclose it within double quotes (" "). |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 7.0.7 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to generate an SSH keypair (private and public) and to install the public ssh key on your device. When the
public SSH key is installed, the user with the associated private key can login to management center and threat
defense without a password. Only local users can initiate creation of the public SSH key. LDAP users do not have the privilege to
create the public SSH keys using this command.

For FXOS-based threat
defense devices, only one public key for each user is permitted. Thus, for such devices, when you use the create command again, you
will be prompted to confirm to overwrite the existing SSH key.

The private key is never stored in a file on the management center or the device. The output of this command is the only way
you can know the private key.

This command is applicable for management center and threat
defense versions 7.6 and higher.

## Examples

The following is sample output from the configure ssh pubkeys create  command:

```

> configure ssh pubkeys create ecdsa 384 "My Comment"
Enter key password (empty for no password):
Confirm key password:

## configure ssh pubkeys add

To manually install an existing public SSH key, use the configure ssh pubkeys add  command.

configure ssh pubkeys add
alg
pubKey
`[`
comment
`]`

## Syntax Description

| alg | The key algorithm of the public key. Example, ssh-rsa, ssh-ed25519, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, and so on. |
| --- | --- |
| pubKey | The base64 encoded public key to install. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 7.0.7 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to manually install an existing public key. When the public SSH key is added, the user with the associated
private key can login to management center and threat
defense without a password. Only local users can add the public SSH key. LDAP users do not have the privilege to add the public SSH
keys using this command.

For FXOS-based threat
defense devices, only one public key for each user is permitted. Thus, for such devices, when you use the add command again, you
will be prompted to confirm to overwrite the existing SSH key.

You can use any key algorithm that is supported by the SSH on the device. This command is applicable for management center and threat
defense versions 7.6 and higher.

## Examples

The following is sample output from the configure ssh pubkeys add  command:

```

## configure ssl-protocol

To configure the SSL protocols clients can use in HTTPS
connections to the device, when using the local manager, use the
configure
ssl-protocol  command.

configure
ssl-protocol`{` protocol\_list `|`default`}`

## Syntax Description

| default | Enables the default SSL protocol list: TLSv1.1 , TLSv1.2 . |
| --- | --- |
| protocol\_list | A comma-separated list specifying any of the following protocols: TLSv1 , TLSv1.1 , TLSv1.2 , SSLv3 . |

### Command Default

The default setting is
TLSv1.1 ,
TLSv1.2 .

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

This command sets the protocols clients can use for HTTPS web access to the device. This is used with the local manager, device manager. It is not used with a remote manager.

| **Note** | ---   If you use this command to disable the protocol you are currently using to communicate with the device, you will lose the connection.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following example configures the device to accept all SSL
protocols for HTTPS connections.

```

> show ssl-protocol
The supported ssl protocols are TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2
> configure ssl-protocol TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,SSLv3
The following ssl protocols are now enabled:  TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 SSLv3
> show ssl-protocol
The supported ssl protocols are  TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 SSLv3

```

## configure tcp-randomization

To disable TCP sequence number randomization, use the
configure
tcp-randomization  command.

configure tcp-randomization `{` enable `|`disable`}`

## Syntax Description

| enable | Change TCP sequence numbers in incoming and outgoing packets randomly to prevent attackers from anticipating the next packet's sequence number. |
| --- | --- |
| disable | Do not change TCP sequence numbers in incoming and outgoing packets. |

### Command Default

TCP sequence number
randomization is enabled by default.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.2 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Each TCP connection has two initial sequence numbers (ISNs): one generated by the client and one generated by the server.
The threat
defense device randomizes the ISN of the TCP SYN passing in both the inbound and outbound directions.

Randomizing the ISN
of the protected host prevents an attacker from predicting the next ISN for a
new connection and potentially hijacking the new session.

You can disable TCP
initial sequence number randomization if necessary, for example, because data
is getting scrambled. For example, you might be using a software test tool,
software product, or hardware device that depends on TCP packets having
sequential numbering. Changing the TCP randomization setting affects all
interfaces and all traffic on the device; you cannot change it for specific
interfaces or traffic classes.

You should disable
TCP sequence number randomization only if you encounter specific problems due
to randomization.

| **Note** | ---   Although you can disable TCP sequence number randomization when using device manager, each time you deploy the configuration from device manager, the feature is re-enabled. If you want to keep TCP sequence number randomization disabled, you must re-enter the command after each deployment.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following
example disables TCP sequence number randomization.

```

> configure tcp-randomization disable

```

To determine if TCP
sequence number randomization is currently enabled or disabled, look in the
running configuration for the
set connection
random-sequence-number disable  command. This command will be in
the global\_policy policy map, so you can limit your view of the configuration
by using the
show running-config
policy-map  command. If the
set connection
random-sequence-number  command does not appear in the
configuration, then TCP sequence number randomization is enabled.

For example, the
following shows that TCP sequence number randomization is disabled (the
relevant command is highlighted).

```

> show running-config policy-map
!
policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map
 parameters
  message-length maximum client auto
  message-length maximum 512
  no tcp-inspection
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect dns preset_dns_map
  inspect ftp
  inspect h323 h225
  inspect h323 ras
  inspect rsh
  inspect rtsp
  inspect sqlnet
  inspect skinny
  inspect sunrpc
  inspect xdmcp
  inspect sip
  inspect netbios
  inspect tftp
  inspect ip-options
  inspect icmp
  inspect icmp error
 class tcp
  set connection random-sequence-number disable
!

```

The following
example shows that TCP sequence number randomization is enabled because the
set connection
random-sequence-number  command is not in the global\_policy policy
map.

```

> show running-config policy-map
!
policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map
 parameters
  message-length maximum client auto
  message-length maximum 512
  no tcp-inspection
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect dns preset_dns_map
  inspect ftp
  inspect h323 h225
  inspect h323 ras
  inspect rsh
  inspect rtsp
  inspect sqlnet
  inspect skinny
  inspect sunrpc
  inspect xdmcp
  inspect sip
  inspect netbios
  inspect tftp
  inspect ip-options
  inspect icmp
  inspect icmp error

```

## configure unlock\_time

To set the length of
time after which a user account is automatically unlocked after being locked
for exceeding the maximum number of failed logins, use the
configure
unlock\_time  command. This command works in CC/UCAPL compliance
mode only.

configure
unlock\_timenumber

## Syntax Description

| number | Specifies the unlock time in minutes, from 1 to 9999. |
| --- | --- |

### Command Default

When running in
CC/UCAPL mode, the default unlock time is 30 minutes.

When not running in
CC/UCAPL mode, user accounts remain locked until you unlock them using the
configure user
unlock  command. You cannot set an automatic unlock time.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.2.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

If you are running
in CC/UCAPL compliance mode, you can set a global unlock time for locked out
users. After the time expires for a given user who has exceeded the maximum
failed login attempts for the user account, the account is unlocked and the
user can try again. Use the
configure user
maxfailedlogins  command to set the maximum number of failed login
attempts you will allow.

Even with an unlock
time set, you can unlock a user account at any time using the
configure user
unlock  command. The user does not need to wait for the unlock
time to expire.

## Examples

The following
example configures an unlock time of 60 minutes.

```

> configure unlock_time 60

```

## conn data-rate

To view the connections on the device that are passing heavy loads of data, use the
conn data-rate  command. This command displays per-flow data
rate along with the existing connection information. To disable the collection of
connections by data-rate, use the no  form of the command.

conn data-rate

no conn data-rate

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.6 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The conn data-rate  command is most useful to determine which
connections, and users, might be contributing the most to the overall load on the
device.

When enabled, the conn data-rate  feature tracks two statistics
for all connections:

* The current (1-second) data rate in the forward and reverse direction of a connection.
* The maximum 1-second data rate in the forward and reverse direction of a connection.

## Examples

The following example shows how to enable the connection data rate
collection, verify that the feature is enabled, and view data rates:

```

> conn data-rate
> show conn data-rate
Connection data rate tracking is currently enabled.
Use 'show conn detail' to see the data rates of active connections.

> show conn detail

TCP outside: 198.51.100.1/46994 NP Identity Ifc: 203.0.113.1/22,
flags UOB , idle 0s, uptime 9m24s, timeout 1h0m, bytes 68627
Initiator: 198.51.100.1, Responder: 203.0.113.1

## copy

To copy a file to or from flash memory, use the
copy  command.

copy
`[`
/noconfirm
`|`
/noverify
`]`
`[`
interface\_name
`]`
 `{`
/pcap capture:/
`[`
buffer\_name
`] |`
src\_url
 `|`
running-config
 `|`
startup-config
`}`
dest\_url

## Syntax Description

| /noverify | (Optional) Skips the signature verification when copying development key signed images. |
| --- | --- |
| /noconfirm | (Optional) Copies the file without a confirmation prompt. |
| *interface\_name* | (Optional) Specifies the interface name through which the file will be copied. If you do not specify the interface, the threat defense checks the data routing table. To use **management** or any other management-only interface, which is not part of the data routing table, you must specify it using this option. |
| /pcap capture:/ [ buffer\_name] | Copies the raw packet capture dump of the capture  command from the specified buffer. |
| running-config | Specifies the running configuration stored in system memory. |
| startup-config | Specifies the startup configuration stored in flash memory. The startup configuration is a hidden file in flash memory. |
| src-url  dest-url | Specifies the source file, the file you are copying, and the destination file, the file you are creating through the copy. You cannot copy between two remote locations, so if the source file is local, the destination file can be local or remote. If the source file is remote, the destination file must be local. Use the following URL syntax for file locations:   * diskn:/ [[path / ]filename ]—disk0:    is the internal memory. Other drive numbers represent   external storage such as a USB drive, SSD, or SD card. * smb:/[[path/]filename] —Indicates Server Message Block, a   UNIX server local file system. * ftp://[[user[:password]@]   server[:port]/[path/]   filename[;type=xx]] —The   type  can be   one of these keywords:   ap  (ASCII   passive mode),   an  (ASCII   normal mode),   ip    (Default—Binary passive mode),   in  (Binary   normal mode). * http[s]://[[user[:password]   @]server[:port]/[path/]filename] * scp://[[user[:password]@]   server[/path]/filename[;int=interface\_name]] —Indicates an SCP server.   The   ;int=interface  option bypasses the route lookup   and always uses the specified interface to reach the Secure Copy (SCP) server. * system:/[[path/]filename] —Represents the system memory. * tftp://[[user[:password]@]   server[ :port]   /[path/]filename[;int=interface\_name]] —Indicates a TFTP server.   The pathname cannot contain spaces. The   ;int=interface  option bypasses the route lookup   and always uses the specified interface to reach the TFTP server. * cluster\_trace:  —Indicates the cluster\_trace   file system. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 7.1 | If you do not specify the interface, the threat defense checks the data routing table. There is no fallback to the management routing table. Formerly, the default lookup was the management routing table with fallback to the data routing table. Due to the merging of the Management and Diagnostic interfaces, the management routing table is no longer used automatically; you must specify the Management interface if you want to use it. |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

After you have performed a cluster-wide capture, you can
simultaneously copy the same capture file from all units in the cluster to a
TFTP server by entering the following command on the master unit:

cluster exec copy
/noconfirm /pcap capture:cap\_name
tftp://location/path/filename.pcap

Multiple PCAP files, one from each unit, are copied to the TFTP
server. The destination capture file name is automatically attached with the
unit name, such as filename\_A.pcap, filename\_B.pcap, where A and B are cluster
unit names.

| **Note** | ---   A different destination name gets generated if you add the unit name at the end of the filename.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following example makes a copy of the install log.

```

> copy /noconfirm flash:/install.log flash:/install.save.log
Copy in progress...CC
INFO: No digital signature found
150498 bytes copied in 0.20 secs

```

The following example shows how to copy a file from the disk to
a TFTP server in the system execution space:

```

> copy /noconfirm disk0:/install.log
tftp://10.7.0.80/install.log

```

The following example shows how to copy the running
configuration to a TFTP server:

```

> copy /noconfirm running-config tftp://10.7.0.80/firepower/device1.cfg

```

The following example shows how to copy a development key signed
image without verifying it:

```

> copy /noverify /noconfirm lfbff.SSA exa_lfbff.SSA
Source filename [lfbff.SSA]?
Destination filename [exa_lfbff.SSA]?
Copy in progress...CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

## cpu hog granular-detection

To provide real-time hog detection and set the CPU hog threshold
in a short period of time, use the
cpu hog
granular-detection  command.

cpu hog
granular-detection`[` countnumber`] [` thresholdvalue`]`

## Syntax Description

| count number | Specifies the number of code execution interruptions performed. Values are from 1-10000000. The default and recommended value is 1000. |
| --- | --- |
| threshold value | Ranges from 1 to 100. If not set, the default is used, which varies among platforms. |

### Command Default

The default
count  is 1000.
The default
threshold
varies among platforms.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The
cpu hog
granular-detection  command interrupts the current code execution
every 10 milliseconds, and the total number of interruptions is the count. The
interruption checks for CPU hogging. If there is any, it is logged. This
command reduces the granularity of CPU hog detection in the data path.

Each scheduler-based hog is associated with up to 5
interrupt-based hog entries; each entry could have up to 3 tracebacks. The
interrupt-based hog cannot be overwritten; if there is no space, the new one is
discarded. The scheduler-based hog is still reused according to the LRU policy,
and its associated interrupt-based hog is cleared by then.

## Examples

The following example show how to trigger CPU hog detection:

```

> cpu hog granular-detection count 1000 threshold 10
Average time spent on 1000 detections is 10 seconds, and it may take longer
under heavy traffic.
Please leave time for it to finish and use show process cpu-hog to check results.

```

### Related Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| show processes cpu-hog | Displays the processes that are hogging the CPU. |
| clear process cpu-hog | Clears the processes that are hogging the CPU. |

## cpu profile activate

To start CPU profiling, use the
cpu profile
activate  command.

cpu profile
activate`[` n\_samples `[` sample-processprocess\_name`] [` trigger cpu-usagecpu% `[` process\_name`]]]`

## Syntax Description

| n\_samples | Allocates memory for storing n  number of samples. Valid values are from 1 to 100,000. |
| --- | --- |
| sample-process process\_name | Samples only a specific process. |
| trigger cpu-usage cpu% [process\_name] | Prevents the profiler from starting until the global 5-second CPU percentage is greater and stops the profiler if the CPU percentage drops below this value.  If you specify a process name, it uses the process’s 5-second CPU percentage as a trigger. |

### Command Default

The
n\_samples
default value is 1000.

The
cpu%  default
value is 0.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The CPU profiler can help you determine which process is using
more CPU. Profiling the CPU captures the address of the process that was
running on the CPU when the timer interrupt fired. This profiling occurs every
10 milliseconds, regardless of the CPU load. For example, if you take 5000
samples, the profiling takes exactly 50 seconds to complete. If the amount of
CPU time that the CPU profiler uses is relatively low, the samples take longer
to collect. The CPU profile records are sampled in a separate buffer.

Use the
show cpu
profile  command in conjunction with the
cpu profile
activate  command to display information that you can collect and
that the TAC can use for troubleshooting CPU issues. The
show cpu profile
dump  command output is in hexadecimal format.

If the CPU profiler is waiting for a starting condition to
occur, the
show cpu
profile  command displays the following output:

```

CPU profiling started: 12:45:57.209 UTC Wed Nov 14 2012
CPU Profiling waiting on starting condition.
Core 0: 0 out of 10 samples collected.
Core 1: 0 out of 10 samples collected.
Core 2: 0 out of 10 samples collected.
Core 3: 0 out of 10 samples collected.
CP
0 out of 10 samples collected.

```

## Examples

The following example activates the profiler and instructs it to
store 1000 samples, the default. Next, the
show cpu
profile  command shows that the profiling is in progress. After
waiting some time, the next
show cpu
profile  command shows that profiling has completed. Finally, we
use the
show cpu profile
dump  command to get the results. Copy the output and provide it
to Cisco Technical Support. You might need to log your SSH session to get the
full output.

```

> cpu profile activate
Activated CPU profiling for 1000 samples.
Use "show cpu profile" to display the progress or "show cpu profile dump" to interrupt
profiling and display the incomplete results.

| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

You can use the
crashinfo force
command to test the crash output generation. In the crash output, there is
nothing that differentiates a real crash from a crash resulting from the
crashinfo force
page-fault  or
crashinfo force
watchdog  command (because these are real crashes). The device
reloads after the crash dump is complete.

Caution Do not use the
crashinfo force
command in a production environment. The
crashinfo force
command crashes the device and forces it to reload.

## Examples

The following example forces a crash due to a page fault.

```

## About Prefiltering

Prefiltering is the first phase of access control, before the system performs more resource-intensive evaluation. Prefiltering
is simple, fast, and early. Prefiltering uses limited outer-header criteria to quickly handle traffic. Compare this to subsequent
evaluation, which uses inner headers and has more robust inspection capabilities.

Configure prefiltering to:

* Improve performance— The sooner you exclude traffic that does not require inspection, the better. You can fastpath or block
  certain types of plaintext, passthrough tunnels based on their outer encapsulation headers, without inspecting their encapsulated
  connections. You can also fastpath or block any other connections that benefit from early handling.
* Tailor deep inspection to encapsulated traffic—You can rezone certain types of tunnels so that you can later handle their
  encapsulated connections using the same inspection criteria. Rezoning is necessary because after prefiltering, access control
  uses inner headers.

### About Prefilter Policies

Prefiltering is a policy-based feature. To assign it to a device, you assign it to the access
control policy that is assigned to the device.

#### Policy Components: Rules and Default Action

In a prefilter policy, *tunnel rules*, *prefilter rules*, and a *default action* handle network traffic:

* Tunnel and prefilter rules—First, rules in a prefilter policy handle traffic in the order you specify. Tunnel rules match
  specific tunnels only and support rezoning. Prefilter rules have a wider range of constraints and do not support rezoning.
  For more information, see [Tunnel vs Prefilter Rules](#id_23357).
* Default action (tunnels only)—If a tunnel does not match any rules, the default action handles it. The default action can
  block these tunnels, or continue access control on their individual encapsulated connections. You cannot rezone tunnels with
  the default action.

  There is no default action for nonencapsulated traffic. If a nonencapsulated connection does not match any prefilter rules,
  the system continues with access control.

#### Connection Logging

You can log connections fastpathed and blocked by the prefilter policy. See Other Connections You Can Log in the [Firepower Management Center
Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config) for more information.

Connection events contain information on whether and how logged connections—including entire tunnels—were prefiltered. You
can view this information in event views (workflows), dashboards, and reports, and use it as correlation criteria. Keep in
mind that because fastpathed and blocked connections are not subject to deep inspection, associated connection events contain
limited information.

#### Default Prefilter Policy

Every access control policy has an associated prefilter policy.

The system uses a default policy if you do not configure custom prefiltering. Initially, this system-provided policy passes
all traffic to the next phase of access control. You can change the policy's default action and configure its logging options,
but you cannot add rules to it or delete it.

#### Prefilter Policy Inheritance and Multitenancy

Access control uses a hierarchical implementation that complements multitenancy. Along with other advanced settings, you can
lock a prefilter policy association, enforcing that association in all descendant access control policies. For more information,
see [Access Control Policy Inheritance](access-overview.html#concept_F5F96D819A084248AFAACE3BE64F99D8).

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays policies created in the current domain, which you can edit. It also displays
policies created in ancestor domains, which you cannot edit. To view and edit policies created in a lower domain, switch to
that domain. The default prefilter policy belongs to the Global domain.

### Tunnel vs Prefilter Rules

Whether you configure a tunnel or prefilter rule depends on the specific type of traffic you want to match and the actions
or further analysis you want to perform.

| Characteristic | Tunnel Rules | Prefilter Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary function | Quickly fastpath, block, or rezone plaintext, passthrough tunnels. | Quickly fastpath or block any other connection that benefits from early handling. |
| Encapsulation and port/protocol criteria | Encapsulation conditions match only plaintext tunnels over selected protocols, listed in [Encapsulation Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_5b5a02a2-260d-461e-a3bf-4c2503d7c5c7). | Port conditions can use a wider range of port and protocol constraints than tunnel rules; see [Port, Protocol, and ICMP Code Rule Conditions](interfaces-settings-qos.html#Cisco_Concept.dita_7bef1e8e-aa4c-4ede-b44c-8b8fe490febb). |
| Network criteria | Tunnel endpoint conditions constrain the endpoints of the tunnels you want to handle; see [Network Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_895cafbb-9541-4bda-81cd-647a414adeab). | Network conditions constrain the source and destination hosts in each connection; see [Network Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_895cafbb-9541-4bda-81cd-647a414adeab). |
| Direction | Bidirectional or unidirectional (configurable).  Tunnel rules are bidirectional by default, so they can handle all traffic between tunnel endpoints. | Unidirectional only (nonconfigurable).  Prefilter rules match source-to-destination traffic only. |
| Rezone sessions for further analysis | Supported, using tunnel zones; see [Tunnel Zones and Prefiltering](#id_30606). | Not supported. |

### Prefiltering vs Access Control

Prefilter and access control policies both allow you to block and trust traffic, though the prefiltering "trust" functionality
is called "fastpathing" because it skips more inspection. The following table explains this and other differences between
prefiltering and access control, to help you decide whether to configure custom prefiltering.

If you do not configure custom prefiltering, you can only approximate—not replicate—prefilter functionality with early-placed
Block and Trust rules in the access control policy.

| Characteristic | Prefiltering | Access Control | For more information, see... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary function | Quickly fastpath or block certain types of plaintext, passthrough tunnels (see [Encapsulation Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_5b5a02a2-260d-461e-a3bf-4c2503d7c5c7)), or tailor subsequent inspection to their encapsulated traffic.  Fastpath or block any other connections that benefit from early handling. | Inspect and control all network traffic, using simple or complex criteria, including contextual information and deep inspection results. | [About Prefiltering](#id_23215) |
| Implementation | Prefilter policy.  The prefilter policy is invoked by the access control policy. | Access control policy.  The access control policy is a main configuration. In addition to invoking subpolicies, access control policies have their own rules. | [About Prefilter Policies](#id_18072)  [Associating Other Policies with Access Control](access-policies.html#id_17609) |
| Sequence within access control | First.  The system matches traffic to prefilter criteria before all other access control configurations. | — | — |
| Rule actions | Fewer.  You can stop further inspection (Fastpath and Block) or allow further analysis with the rest of access control (Analyze). | More.  Access control rules have a larger variety of actions, including monitoring, deep inspection, block with reset, and interactive blocking. | [Tunnel and Prefilter Rule Components](#id_18094)  [Access Control Rule Actions](access-rules.html#ID-2190-0000021f) |
| Bypass capability | Fastpath rule action.  Fastpathing traffic in the prefilter stage bypasses all further inspection and handling, including:   * Security Intelligence * authentication requirements imposed by an identity policy * SSL decryption * access control rules * deep inspection of packet payloads * discovery * rate limiting | Trust rule action.  Traffic trusted by access control rules is only exempt from deep inspection and discovery. | [Introduction to Access Control Rules](access-rules.html#ID-2190-00000005) |
| Rule criteria | Limited.  Rules in the prefilter policy use simple network criteria: IP address, VLAN tag, port, and protocol.  For tunnels, tunnel endpoint conditions specify the IP address of the routed interfaces of the network devices on either side of the tunnel. | Robust.

### Passthrough Tunnels and Access Control

Plaintext (nonencrypted) tunnels can encapsulate multiple connections, often flowing between discontinuous networks. These
tunnels are especially useful for routing custom protocols over IP networks, IPv6 traffic over IPv4 networks, and so on.

An outer *encapsulation header* specifies the source and destination IP addresses of the *tunnel endpoints*—the routed interfaces of the network devices on either side of the tunnel. Inner *payload headers* specify the source and destination IP addresses of the encapsulated connections' actual endpoints.

Often, network security devices handle plaintext tunnels as *passthrough* traffic. That is, the device is not one of the tunnel endpoints. Instead, it is deployed between the tunnel endpoints and
monitors the traffic flowing between them.

Some network security devices enforce security policies using outer IP headers. Even for plaintext tunnels, these devices
have no control over or insight into individual encapsulated connections and their payloads.

By contrast, the system leverages access control as follows:

* Outer header evaluation—First, prefiltering uses outer headers to handle traffic. You can block or fastpath entire plaintext,
  passthrough tunnels at this stage.
* Inner header evaluation—Next, the rest of access control (and other features such as QoS) use the innermost detectable level
  of headers to ensure the most granular level of inspection and handling possible.

  If a passthrough tunnel is not encrypted, the system acts on its individual encapsulated connections at this stage. You must
  *rezone* a tunnel (see [Tunnel Zones and Prefiltering](#id_30606)) to act on all its encapsulated connections.

Access control has no insight into encrypted passthrough tunnels. For example, access control rules see a passthrough VPN
tunnel as one connection. The system handles the entire tunnel using only the information in its outer, encapsulation header.

## Best Practices for Fastpath Prefiltering

When you use the fastpath action in a prefilter rule, the matching traffic bypasses inspection and is simply transmitted through
the device. Use this action for traffic that you can trust and that would not benefit from any of the security features available.

The following types of traffic are ideal for fastpathing. For example, you could configure the rules to fastpath any traffic
from or to the IP addresses of the endpoints or servers. You can further limit the rule based on ports used.

* VPN traffic that is going through the device. That is, the device is not an endpoint in the VPN topology.
* Scanner traffic. Scanner probes can create a lot of false-positive responses from intrusion policies.
* Voice/video.
* Backups.
* Management traffic (sftunnel) that traverses FTD devices. Performing deep inspection on management traffic (using access control policies) can cause issues. You can prefilter
  based on port TCP/8305 between the management center and managed devices.

## Best Practices for Encapsulated Traffic Handling

This topic discusses guidelines for the following types of encapsulated traffic:

* Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
* Point-to-Point Protocol (PPTP)
* IPinIP
* IPv6inIP
* Teredo

### GRE Tunnel Limitations

GRE tunnel processing is limited to IPv4 and IPv6 passenger flows. Other protocols, such as PPTP and WCCP, are not supported
within the GRE tunnel.

### Understand Snort version support for your managed devices

The inspection engine used by managed devices is known as Snort. Snort 3 supports
more features than Snort 2. To understand how these affect managed devices on your
network, you must know:

* Which versions of Snort your device supports.

  Snort version support can be found in the section on bundled components in
  the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide.
* How the FMC and FTD software support Snort 2 and Snort 3

  Limitations of Snort 2 and Snort 3 can be found in the *Feature Limitations of Snort 3 for FMC-Managed FTD* topic in the [Firepower Management
  Center Snort 3 Configuration
  Guide](https://www.cisco.com/go/fmc-snort3).

### GRE v1 and PPTP bypass outer flow processing

GRE v1 (sometimes referred to as *stateful GRE*) and PPTP traffic bypass outer flow processing.

Passenger flow processing is supported for IPv6inIP and Teredo but the following limitations apply:

* Sessions are over a single tunnel that is not load-balanced
* There is no HA or clustering replication
* Primary and secondary flow relationships are not maintained
* Prefilter policy white and black lists are not supported

### GRE v0 sequence number field must be optional

All endpoints sending traffic on the network must send GREv0 traffic with the sequence number field as optional; otherwise,
the sequence number field is removed. RFC 1701 and RFC 2784 both specify the sequence field as optional.

### How tunnels work with interfaces

Prefilter and access control policy rules are applied to all tunnel types on routed, transparent, inline-set, inline-tap,
and passive interfaces.

## Configure Prefiltering

To perform custom prefiltering, configure prefilter policies and assign the policies
to access control policies. It is through the access control policy that prefilter
policies get assigned to managed devices.

Only one person should edit a policy at a time, using a single browser window. If multiple users save the same policy, the
last saved changes are retained. For your convenience, the system displays information on who (if anyone) is currently editing
each policy. To protect the privacy of your session, a warning appears after 30 minutes of inactivity on the policy editor.
After 60 minutes, the system discards your changes.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control > Prefilter. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click New Policy to create a custom prefilter policy.  A new prefilter policy has no rules and a default action of Analyze all tunnel traffic. It performs no logging or tunnel rezoning. You can also Copy  (copy icon) or Edit (edit icon) an existing policy. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the prefilter policy's default action and its logging options.   * Default action—Choose a default action for supported plaintext, passthrough tunnels: Analyze all tunnel traffic (with access control) or Block all tunnel traffic. * Default action logging—Click Logging (logging icon) next to the default action; see Logging Connections with a Policy Default   Action in the [Firepower Management Center   Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).   You can configure default action logging for blocked tunnels only. |
| **Step 4** | Configure tunnel and prefilter rules.  In a custom prefilter policy, you can use both kinds of rule, in any order. Create rules depending on the specific type of traffic you want to match and the actions or further analysis you want to perform; see [Tunnel vs Prefilter Rules](#id_23357).   | **Caution** | Exercise caution when using tunnel rules to assign tunnel zones. Connections in rezoned tunnels may not match security zone constraints in later evaluation. For more information, see [Tunnel Zones and Prefiltering](#id_30606). | | --- | --- |   For detailed information on configuring rule components, see [Tunnel and Prefilter Rule Components](#id_18094). |
| **Step 5** | Evaluate rule order. To move a rule, click and drag or use the right-click menu to cut and paste.  Properly creating and ordering rules is a complex task, but one that is essential to building an effective deployment. If you do not plan carefully, rules can preempt other rules or contain invalid configurations. For more information, see [Best Practices for Access Control Rules](access-overview.html#ID-2176-000005b6). |
| **Step 6** | Save the prefilter policy. |
| **Step 7** | For configurations that support tunnel zone constraints, appropriately handle rezoned tunnels.  Match connections in rezoned tunnels by using tunnel zones as source zone constraints. |
| **Step 8** | Associate the prefilter policy with the access control policy deployed to your managed devices.  See [Associating Other Policies with Access Control](access-policies.html#id_17609). |
| **Step 9** | Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).   | **Note** | When you deploy a prefilter policy, its rules are not applied on the existing tunnel sessions. Hence, traffic on an existing connection is not bound by the new policy that is deployed. In addition, the policy hit count is incremented only for the first packet of a connection that matches a policy. Thus, the traffic on an existing connection that could match a policy is omitted from the hit count. To have the policy rules effectively applied, clear the existing tunnel sessions, and then deploy the policy. | | --- | --- | |

### What to do next

If you will deploy time-based rules, specify the time zone
of the device to which the policy is assigned. See [Time Zone](interfaces-settings-platform.html#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_b1764425-499d-4101-bc02-d6c56656fb21).

### Tunnel and Prefilter Rule Components

#### State (Enabled/Disabled)

By default, rules are enabled. If you disable a rule, the system does not use it and stops generating warnings and errors
for that rule.

#### Position

Rules are numbered, starting at 1. The system matches traffic to rules in top-down order by ascending rule number. The first
rule that traffic matches is the rule that handles that traffic, regardless of rule type (tunnel vs prefilter).

#### Action

A rule's action determines how the system handles and logs matching traffic:

* Fastpath—Exempts matching traffic from all further inspection and control, including access control, identity requirements,
  and rate limiting. Fastpathing a tunnel fastpaths all encapsulated connections.
* Block—Blocks matching traffic without further inspection of any kind. Blocking a tunnel blocks all encapsulated connections.
* Analyze—Allows traffic to continue to be analyzed by the rest of access control, using inner headers. If passed by access
  control and any related deep inspection, this traffic may also be rate limited. For tunnel rules, enables rezoning with the
  Assign Tunnel Zone option.

#### Direction (Tunnel Rules Only)

A tunnel rule's direction determines how the system source and destination criteria:

* Match tunnels only from source (unidirectional)—Match source-to-destination traffic only. Matching traffic must originate
  from one of the specified source interfaces or tunnel endpoints, and leave through one of the destination interfaces or tunnel
  endpoints.
* Match tunnels from source and destination (bidirectional)—Match both source-to-destination traffic and destination-to-source
  traffic. The effect is identical to writing two unidirectional rules, one the mirror of the other.

Prefilter rules are always unidirectional.

#### Assign Tunnel Zone (Tunnel Rules Only)

In a tunnel rule, assigning a tunnel zone (whether existing or created on the fly), *rezones* matching tunnels. Rezoning requires the Analyze action.

Rezoning a tunnel allows other configurations—such as access control rules—to recognize all the tunnel's encapsulated connections
as belonging together. By using a tunnel's assigned tunnel zone as an interface constraint, you can tailor inspection to its
encapsulated connections. For more information, see [Tunnel Zones and Prefiltering](#id_30606).

| **Caution** | ---   Exercise caution when assigning tunnel zones. Connections in rezoned tunnels may not match security zone constraints in later evaluation. See [Using Tunnel Zones](#id_31063) for a brief walkthrough of a tunnel zone implementation, and a discussion of the implications of rezoning without explicitly handling rezoned traffic.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Conditions

Conditions specify the specific traffic the rule handles. Traffic must match all a rule's conditions to match the rule. Each
condition type has its own tab in the rule editor.

You can prefilter traffic using the following *outer-header* constraints. You must
constrain tunnel rules by encapsulation protocol.

* Interface—[Interface Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_c26e842c-6d24-4b6e-b644-6f4a3eda446e)
* Network (prefilter rule)/Tunnel Endpoints (tunnel rule)—[Network Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_895cafbb-9541-4bda-81cd-647a414adeab)
* VLAN—[VLAN Tags Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_a0431325-02f3-4417-aebd-c485767874ac)
* Ports (prefilter rule)/Encapsulation and Ports (tunnel rule)—[Port Rule Conditions for Prefilter Rules](#Cisco_Concept.dita_7946e740-bc51-4e4f-9a7d-9451ca303c64) or
  [Encapsulation Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_5b5a02a2-260d-461e-a3bf-4c2503d7c5c7)
* Time Range—[Time and Day Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_c7e74804-4c62-4576-ab25-ffaf389bae93)

#### Logging

A rule's logging settings govern the records the system keeps of the traffic it handles.

In tunnel and prefilter rules, you can log fastpathed and blocked traffic (the Fastpath and
Block actions). For traffic subject to further analysis (the Analyze action), logging in the
prefilter policy is disabled, although matching connections may still be logged by other
configurations. Logging is performed on inner flows, not on the encapsulating flow. For more information, see Logging Connections with Tunnel and Prefilter Rules in the [Firepower Management Center
Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).

#### Comments

Each time you save changes to a rule you can add comments. For example, you might summarize the overall configuration for
the benefit of other users, or note when you change a rule and the reason for the change.

You cannot edit or delete these comments after you save the rule.

[Best Practices for Access Control Rules](access-overview.html#ID-2176-000005b6)

### Prefilter Rule Conditions

Rule conditions enable you to fine-tune your prefilter policy to target the networks you want to control. See one of the following
sections for more information.

* [Interface Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_c26e842c-6d24-4b6e-b644-6f4a3eda446e)
* [Network Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_895cafbb-9541-4bda-81cd-647a414adeab)
* [VLAN Tags Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_a0431325-02f3-4417-aebd-c485767874ac)
* [Port Rule Conditions for Prefilter Rules](#Cisco_Concept.dita_7946e740-bc51-4e4f-9a7d-9451ca303c64)
* [Time and Day Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_c7e74804-4c62-4576-ab25-ffaf389bae93)

#### Interface Rule Conditions

Interface rule conditions control traffic by its source and destination interfaces.

Depending on the rule type and the devices in your deployment, you can use predefined *interface objects* called *security zones* or *interface groups* to build interface conditions. Interface objects segment your network to help you manage and classify traffic flow by grouping
interfaces across multiple devices; see [Interface](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000009b4).

| **Tip** | ---   Constraining rules by interface is one of the best ways to improve system performance. If a rule excludes all of a device’s interfaces, that rule does not affect that device's performance.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Just as all interfaces in an interface object must be of the same type (all inline, passive, switched, routed, or ASA FirePOWER), all interface objects used in an interface condition must be of the same type. Because devices deployed passively do not
transmit traffic, in passive deployments you cannot constrain rules by destination interface.

#### Network Rule Conditions

Network rule conditions control traffic by its source and destination IP address, using inner headers. Tunnel rules, which
use outer headers, have tunnel endpoint conditions instead of network conditions.

You can use predefined objects to build network conditions, or manually specify individual IP addresses or address blocks.

| **Note** | ---   You *cannot* use FDQN network objects in identity rules.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Leave matching criteria empty whenever possible, especially those for security zones, network objects, and port objects. When
you specify multiple criteria, the system must match against every combination of the contents of the criteria you specify.

* [Redirect to Host Name Network Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_36e5a17f-97b6-41f9-aff8-00d314b6b0a0)

#### VLAN Tags Rule Conditions

| **Note** | ---   VLAN tags in access rules only apply to inline sets. Access rules with VLAN tags do not match traffic on firewall interfaces.   --- |
| --- | --- |

VLAN rule conditions control VLAN-tagged traffic, including Q-in-Q (stacked VLAN) traffic. The system uses the innermost VLAN
tag to filter VLAN traffic, with the exception of the prefilter policy, which uses the outermost VLAN tag in its rules.

Note the following Q-in-Q support:

* FTD on Firepower 4100/9300—Does not support Q-in-Q (supports only one VLAN tag).
* FTD on all other models:

  + Inline sets and passive interfaces—Supports Q-in-Q, up to 2 VLAN tags.
  + Firewall interfaces—Does not support Q-in-Q (supports only one VLAN tag).

You can use predefined objects to build VLAN conditions, or manually enter any VLAN tag from 1 to 4094. Use a hyphen to specify
a range of VLAN tags.

You can specify a maximum of 50 VLAN conditions.

In a cluster, if you encounter problems with VLAN matching, edit the access control policy advanced options, Transport/Network
Preprocessor Settings, and select the Ignore the VLAN header when tracking connections option.

| **Note** | ---  The system builds a separate network map for each leaf domain. In a multidomain deployment, using literal VLAN tags to constrain this configuration can have unexpected results. Using override-enabled objects allows descendant domain administrators to tailor Global configurations to their local environments.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Port Rule Conditions for Prefilter Rules

Port conditions match traffic based on the source and destination ports. Depending on the
rule type, “port” can represent any of the following:

* TCP and UDP—You can control TCP and UDP traffic based on the port. The system
  represents this configuration using the protocol number in parentheses, plus an
  optional associated port or port range. For example: TCP(6)/22.
* ICMP—You can control ICMP and ICMPv6 (IPv6-ICMP) traffic based on its internet
  layer protocol plus an optional type and code. For example: ICMP(1):3:3.
* Protocol—You can control traffic using other protocols that do not use ports.

##### Using Source and Destination Port Constraints

If you add both source and destination port constraints, you can only add ports that
share a single transport protocol (TCP or UDP). For example, if you add DNS over TCP
as a source port, you can add Yahoo Messenger Voice Chat (TCP) as a destination port
but not Yahoo Messenger Voice Chat (UDP).

If you add only source ports or only destination ports, you can add ports that use
different transport protocols. For example, you can add both DNS over TCP and DNS
over UDP as destination port conditions in a single access control rule.

##### Matching Non-TCP Traffic with Port Conditions

You can match non-port-based protocols. By default, if you do not specify a port
condition, you are matching IP traffic. Although you can configure port conditions
to match other protocols in prefilter rules, you should use tunnel rules instead
when matching GRE, IP in IP, IPv6 in IP, and Toredo Port 3544.

#### Time and Day Rule Conditions

You can specify a continuous time range or a recurring time period.

For example, a rule can apply only during weekday working hours, or every weekend, or during a holiday shutdown period.

Time-based rules are applied based on the local time of the device that processes the traffic.

Time-based rules are supported only on FTD devices. If you assign a policy with a time-based rule to a different type of device, the time restriction associated with
the rule is ignored on that device. You will see warnings in this case.

### Tunnel Rule Conditions

Rule conditions enable you to fine-tune your tunnel policy to target the networks you
want to control. For tunnel rules, you can use the following conditions:

* Interface Objects—The security zones or interface groups
  that define the device interfaces through which the connections pass. See [Interface Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_c26e842c-6d24-4b6e-b644-6f4a3eda446e).
* Tunnel Endpoints—The network objects that define the
  source and destination IP addresses of the tunnel.
* VLAN Tags—The outermost VLAN tag in the tunnel. See [VLAN Tags Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_a0431325-02f3-4417-aebd-c485767874ac).
* Encapsulation and Ports—The encapsulation protocol of the
  tunnel. See [Encapsulation Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_5b5a02a2-260d-461e-a3bf-4c2503d7c5c7).
* Time Range—The days and times when the rule is active. If
  you do not specify a time range, the rule is always active. See [Time and Day Rule Conditions](#Cisco_Concept.dita_c7e74804-4c62-4576-ab25-ffaf389bae93).

#### Encapsulation Rule Conditions

Encapsulation conditions are specific to tunnel rules.

These conditions control certain types of plaintext, passthrough tunnels by their encapsulation protocol. You must choose
at least one protocol to match before you can save the rule. You can choose:

* GRE (47)
* IP-in-IP (4)
* IPv6-in-IP (41)
* Teredo (UDP (17)/3455)

## Tunnel Zones and Prefiltering

Tunnel zones allow you to use prefiltering to tailor subsequent traffic handling to encapsulated connections.

A special mechanism is required because usually, the system handles traffic using the innermost detectable level of headers.
This ensures the most granular level of inspection possible. But it also means that if a passthrough tunnel is not encrypted,
the system acts on its individual encapsulated connections; see [Passthrough Tunnels and Access Control](#id_29854).

Tunnel zones solve this problem. During the first phase of access control (prefiltering) you can use outer headers to identify
certain types of plaintext, passthrough tunnels. Then, you can *rezone* those tunnels by assigning a custom *tunnel zone*.

Rezoning a tunnel allows other configurations—such as access control rules—to recognize all the tunnel's encapsulated connections
as belonging together. By using a tunnel's assigned tunnel zone as an interface constraint, you can tailor inspection to its
encapsulated connections.

Despite its name, a tunnel zone is not a security zone. A tunnel zone does not represent a set of interfaces. It is more accurate
to think of a tunnel zone as a tag that, in some cases, replaces the security zone associated with an encapsulated connection.

| **Caution** | ---   For configurations that support tunnel zone constraints, connections in rezoned tunnels do **not** match security zone constraints. For example, after you rezone a tunnel, access control rules can match its encapsulated connections with their newly assigned *tunnel* zone, but not with any original *security* zone.   --- |
| --- | --- |

See [Using Tunnel Zones](#id_31063) for a brief walkthrough of a tunnel zone implementation, and a discussion of the implications of rezoning without explicitly
handling rezoned traffic.

### Configurations Supporting Tunnel Zone Constraints

Only access control rules support tunnel zone constraints.

No other configurations support tunnel zone constraints. For example, you cannot use QoS to rate limit a plaintext tunnel
as a whole; you can only rate limit its individual encapsulated sessions.

* [Using Tunnel Zones](#id_31063)
* [Creating Tunnel Zones](#id_18443)

### Using Tunnel Zones

This example procedure summarizes how you might rezone GRE tunnels for further analysis, using tunnel zones. You can adapt
the concepts described in this example to other scenarios where you need to tailor traffic inspection to connections encapsulated
in plaintext, passthrough tunnels.

Consider a situation where your organization's internal traffic flows through the
Trusted security zone. The Trusted security zone represents a set of interfaces
across multiple managed devices deployed in various locations. Your organization's
security policy requires that you allow internal traffic after deep inspection for
exploits and malware.

Internal traffic sometimes includes plaintext, passthrough, GRE tunnels between particular endpoints. Because the traffic
profile of this encapsulated traffic is different from your "normal" interoffice activity—perhaps it is known and benign—you
can limit inspection of certain encapsulated connections while still complying with your security policy.

In this example, after you deploy configuration changes:

* Plaintext, passthrough, GRE-encapsulated tunnels detected in the Trusted zone have their individual encapsulated connections
  evaluated by one set of intrusion and file policies.
* All other traffic in the Trusted zone is evaluated with a different set of intrusion and file policies.

You accomplish this task by *rezoning* GRE tunnels. Rezoning ensures that access
control associates GRE-encapsulated connections with a custom *tunnel* zone,
rather than their original Trusted *security* zone. Rezoning is required due to
the way access control handles encapsulated traffic; see [Passthrough Tunnels and Access Control](#id_29854) and [Tunnel Zones and Prefiltering](#id_30606).

#### Procedure

---

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | Configure custom intrusion and file policies that tailor deep inspection to encapsulated traffic, and another set of intrusion and file policies tailored to nonencapsulated traffic. |
| **Step 2** | Configure custom prefiltering to rezone GRE tunnels flowing through the Trusted security zone.  Create a custom prefilter policy and associate it with access control. In that custom prefilter policy, create a tunnel rule (in this example, `GRE_tunnel_rezone`) and a corresponding tunnel zone (`GRE_tunnel`). For more information, see [Configure Prefiltering](#id_17608).   Table 1. GRE\_tunnel\_rezone Tunnel Rule   | Rule Component | Description | | --- | --- | | Interface object condition | Match internal-only tunnels by using the Trusted security zone as both a Source Interface Object and Destination Interface Object constraint. | | Tunnel endpoint condition | Specify the source and destination endpoints for the GRE tunnels used in your organization.  Tunnel rules are bidirectional by default. If you do not change the Match tunnels from... option, it does not matter which endpoints you specify as source and which as destination. | | Encapsulation condition | Match GRE traffic. | | Assign Tunnel Zone | Create the `GRE_tunnel` tunnel zone, and assign it to tunnels that match the rule. | | Action | Analyze (with the rest of access control). | |
| **Step 3** | Configure access control to handle connections in rezoned tunnels.  In the access control policy deployed to your managed devices, configure a rule (in this example, `GRE_inspection`) that handles the traffic you rezoned. For more information, see [Create and Edit Access Control Rules](access-rules.html#ID-2190-00000090).   Table 2. GRE\_inspection Access Control Rule   | Rule Component | Description | | --- | --- | | Security zone condition | Match rezoned tunnels by using the GRE\_tunnel security zone as a Source Zone constraint. | | Action | Allow, with deep inspection enabled.  Choose the file and intrusion policies tailored to inspect encapsulated internal traffic. |  | **Caution** | If you skip this step, the rezoned connections may match **any** access control rule not constrained by security zone. If the rezoned connections do not match any access control rules, they are handled by the access control policy default action. Make sure this is your intent. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Configure access control to handle nonencapsulated connections flowing through the Trusted security zone.  In the same access control policy, configure a rule (in this example, `internal_default_inspection`) that handles non-rezoned traffic in the Trusted security zone.   Table 3. internal\_default\_inspection Access Control Rule   | Rule Component | Description | | --- | --- | | Security zone condition | Match non-rezoned internal-only traffic by using the Trusted security zone as both a Source Zone and Destination Zone constraint. | | Action | Allow, with deep inspection enabled.  Choose the file and intrusion policies tailored to inspect nonencapsulated internal traffic. | |
| **Step 5** | Evaluate the position of the new access control rules relative to preexisting rules. Change rule order if necessary.  If you place the two new access control rules next to each other, it does not matter which you place first. Because you rezoned GRE tunnels, the two rules cannot preempt each other. |
| **Step 6** | Save all changed configurations. |

---

#### What to do next

* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

### Creating Tunnel Zones

The following procedure explains how to create a tunnel zone in the
object manager. You can also create zones when editing a tunnel
rule.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Objects > Object Management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Chose Tunnel Zone from the list of object types. |
| **Step 3** | Click Add Tunnel Zone. |
| **Step 4** | Enter a Name and, optionally, a Description. |
| **Step 5** | Click Save. |

---

#### What to do next

* Assign tunnel zones to plaintext, passthrough tunnels as part of custom prefiltering; see [Configure Prefiltering](#id_17608).

## Moving Prefilter Rules to an Access Control Policy

You can move prefilter rules from a prefilter policy to the associated access control policy.

### Before you begin

Note the following conditions before you proceed:

* Only prefilter rules can be moved to an access control policy. Tunnel rules cannot be moved.
* The prefilter rules can be moved only to the associated access control policy.
* The prefilter rules with configured interface groups cannot be moved.
* The Action parameter in the prefilter rule is changed to a suitable action in the access control rule when moved. To know what each
  action in the prefilter rule maps to, see the following table:

  | Action in the prefilter rule | Action in the access control rule |
  | --- | --- |
  | Analyze | Allow |
  | Block | Block |
  | Fastpath | Trust |
* Similarly, based on the action configured in the prefilter rule, the logging configuration is set to an appropriate setting
  after the rule is moved, as mentioned in the following table.

  | Action in the prefilter rule | Enabled Logging configurations in the access control rule |
  | --- | --- |
  | Analyze | None of the log settings are enabled. |
  | Block | + Log at Beginning of Connection + Event Viewer + Syslog Server + SNMP Trap |
  | Fastpath | + Log at Beginning of Connection + Log at End of Connection + Event Viewer + Syslog Server + SNMP Trap |
* The comments in the prefilter rule configuration are lost after moving the rule. However, a new comment is added in the moved
  rule mentioning the source prefilter policy.
* While moving rules from the source policy, if another user modifies those rules, the FMC displays a message. You may continue with the process after refreshing the page.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the prefilter policy editor, select the rules that you want to move with a left-click on your mouse.   | **Tip** | To select multiple rules, use the Ctrl (Control) key on your keyboard. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Right-click the selected rules and choose Move to another policy. |
| **Step 3** | Select the destination access control policy from the Access Policy drop-down list. |
| **Step 4** | From the Place Rules drop-down list, choose where you want to position the moved rules:   * To position as the last set of rules in the Default section, choose At the bottom (within the Default section). * To position as the first set of rules in the Mandatory section, choose At the top (within the Mandatory section). |
| **Step 5** | Click Move. |

---

### What to do next

* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

## Prefilter Policy Hit Counts

Hit count indicates the number of times a policy rule has triggered for a matching connection.

For complete information on viewing prefilter policy hit counts, see [Viewing Rule Hit Counts](access-policies.html#id_92824).

## Large Flow Offloads

On Firepower 4100/9300 chassis, certain traffic that you configure to be fastpathed by a prefilter policy is handled by the hardware (specifically, in the
NIC), not by your FTD software. Offloading these connection flows results in higher throughput and lower latency, especially for data-intensive
applications such as large file transfers. This feature is especially useful for data centers. This is called *static flow offload*.

In addition, by default, FTD devices offload flows based on other criteria, including trust. This is called *dynamic flow offload*.

Offloaded flows continue to receive limited stateful inspection, such as basic TCP flag and option checking. The system can
selectively escalate packets to the firewall system for further processing if necessary.

Examples of applications that can benefit from offloading large flows are:

* High Performance Computing (HPC) Research sites, where the FTD device is deployed between storage and high compute stations. When one research site backs up using FTP file transfer or
  file sync over NFS, the large amount of data traffic affects all connections. Offloading FTP file transfer and file sync over
  NFS reduces the impact on other traffic.
* High Frequency Trading (HFT), where the FTD device is deployed between workstations and the Exchange, mainly for compliance purposes. Security is usually not a concern,
  but latency is a major concern.

The following flows can be offloaded:

* (Static flow offload only.) Connections that are fastpathed by the prefilter policy.
* Standard or 802.1Q tagged Ethernet frames only.
* (Dynamic flow offload only):

  + Inspected flows that the inspection engine decides no longer need inspection. These flows include:

    - Flows handled by access control rules that apply the Trust action and are based on security zone, source and destination network
      and port matching only.
    - TLS/SSL flows that are not selected for decryption using an
      SSL policy.
    - Flows that are trusted by the Intelligent Application Bypass (IAB) policy either explicitly or due to exceeding flow bypass
      thresholds.
    - Flows that match file or intrusion policies that result in trusting the flow.
    - Any allowed flow that no longer needs to be inspected.
  + The following IPS preprocessor inspected flows:

    - SSH and SMTP.
    - FTP preprocessor secondary connections.
    - Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) preprocessor secondary connections.
  + Intrusion rules that use keywords (also referred to as *options*)

| **Important** | ---   For details, exceptions, and limitations to the above, see [Flow Offload Limitations](#concept_D380F2E170164CA699509AAF363D7862).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Use Static Flow Offload

To offload eligible traffic to hardware, create a prefilter policy rule that applies the Fastpath action. Use prefilter rules for TCP/UDP, and tunnel rules for GRE.

(Not recommended.) To disable static flow offload and as a by-product, dynamic flow-offload,
use FlexConfig to run the no flow-offload enable  command.
For information about this command, see the Cisco ASA Series Command
Reference, available from <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/adaptive-security-appliance-asa-software/products-command-reference-list.html>.

### Use Dynamic Flow Offload

Dynamic flow offload is enabled by default.

To disable dynamic offload:

```
> configure flow-offload dynamic whitelist disable
```
To re-enable dynamic offload:
```
> configure flow-offload dynamic whitelist enable
```

Note that dynamic offload occurs only if static flow offload is enabled, regardless of whether prefiltering is configured.

* [Flow Offload Limitations](#concept_D380F2E170164CA699509AAF363D7862)

### Flow Offload Limitations

Not all flows can be
offloaded. Even after offload, a flow can be removed from being offloaded under
certain conditions. Following are some of the limitations:

Device Limitations

The feature is supported on the following devices:

* Firepower 4100/9300 running FXOS 1.1.3 or higher.

Flows that cannot be offloaded

The following types of flows cannot be offloaded.

* Any flows that do not use IPv4 addressing, such as IPv6 addressing.
* Flows for any protocol other than TCP, UDP, and GRE.

  | **Note** | ---   PPTP GRE connections cannot be offloaded.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Flows on interfaces configured in passive, inline, or inline tap mode. Routed and switched interfaces are the only types supported.
* Flows that require inspection by Snort or other inspection engines. In some cases, such as FTP, the secondary data channel can be offloaded although the control channel cannot be offloaded.
* IPsec and TLS/DTLS VPN connections that terminate on the device.
* Flows that require encryption or decryption. For example, connections decrypted due to an
  SSL policy.
* Multicast flows in routed mode. They are supported in
  transparent mode if there are only two member interfaces in a
  bridge group.
* TCP Intercept flows.
* TCP state bypass flows. You cannot configure flow offload and TCP
  state bypass on the same traffic.
* Flows tagged with security groups.
* Reverse flows that are forwarded from a different cluster node, in case of asymmetric flows in a cluster.
* Centralized flows in a cluster, if the flow owner is not the control unit.
* Flows that include IP options cannot be dynamically offloaded.

Additional Limitations

* Flow offload and Dead Connection Detection (DCD) are not compatible.
  Do not configure DCD on connections that can be offloaded.
* If more than one flow that matches flow offload conditions are queued
  to be offloaded at the same time to the same location on the
  hardware, only the first flow is offloaded. The other flows are
  processed normally. This is called a *collision*. Use the
  show flow-offload flow  command in
  the CLI to display statistics for this situation.
* Dynamic flow offload disables all TCP normalizer checks.
* Although offloaded flows pass through FXOS interfaces, statistics for these flows do not appear on the logical device interface.
  Thus, logical device interface counters and packet rates do not reflect offloaded flows.

Conditions for reversing offload

After a flow is offloaded, packets within the flow are returned to the FTD for further processing if they meet the following conditions:

* They include TCP options other than Timestamp.
* They are fragmented.
* They are subject to Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing, and ingress packets move from one interface to another.

## History for Prefiltering

| Feature | Minimum FMC | Minimum FTD | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Moving prefilter rules to an access control policy | 6.7 | Any | You can move prefilter rules from a prefilter policy to the associated access control policy.  New/modified pages: In the prefilter policy page, the right-click menu for the selected rules provides a new Move to another policy option.  Supported platforms: FMC |
| Time-based rules | 6.6 | Any | Ability to apply prefilter and tunnel rules depending on the date and time, as determined by the time zone of the FTD device.  See description in [History for Access Control Rules](access-rules.html#id_124655). |
| View Object Details from prefilter rule page | 6.6 | Any | Feature introduced: Option to view details for an object or object group when viewing prefilter rules.  New options: Right-clicking a value in any of the following columns in the prefilter rule list offers an option to view object details: Source Networks, Destination Networks, Source Port, Destination Port, and VLAN Tag.  Supported platforms: Firepower Management Center |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

The following topics explain access
control rules. These rules control which traffic is allowed to pass through the
device, and apply advanced services to the traffic, such as intrusion
inspection.

## Best Practices for Access Control

The access control policy is your primary tool for protecting your internal networks
and preventing your users from accessing undesirable external network resources,
such as inappropriate web sites. Thus, we recommend that you pay special attention
to this policy and fine-tune it to get the level of protection and connectivity that
you need.

The following procedure provides an overview of the basic things you should do with
the access control policy. This is an overview, and does not provide exhaustive
steps for performing each task.

To get to the access control policy, choose Policies > Access Control.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Configure the default action for the policy.  The default action handles connections that do not match the specific rules in the policy. By default, this action is Block, so that anything you miss in the rules is blocked. Thus, you simply need to write access control rules that allow desirable traffic. This is the traditional way to configure the access control policy.  You can do the opposite, where you allow traffic by default, and write rules that drop known undesirable traffic, so that you do not need to have rules for everything you want to allow. This makes it easy for new services to be used, but opens the risk that new undesirable traffic will get through before you notice it. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button.) button, and enable the TLS Server Identity Discovery option.  This option improves the initial application detection and URL category and reputation identification for TLS 1.3 connections. If you do not enable this option, TLS 1.3 traffic might not match your intended rules. This option can also improve the efficacy of decryption rules. |
| **Step 3** | Create as few access control rules as possible.  With traditional firewalls, you might end up with tens of thousands of rules for various combinations of IP address and port. With a next-generation firewall, you can use advanced inspection and avoid some of these detailed rules. The fewer rules you have, the faster the system can evaluate traffic, and the easier it will be for you to find and fix problems within your rule set. |
| **Step 4** | Enabling logging on your access control rules.  Statistics are collected for matching traffic only if you enable logging. Your monitoring dashboards will be inaccurate if you do not enable logging. |
| **Step 5** | Put very specific rules at the top of the policy, and ensure that specific rules are above any more general rule that would match the connections a specific rule would also match.  The policy is evaluated top-down, first match wins. Thus, if you put in a rule that blocks all traffic to a specific subnet, then follow it with a rule that allows access to a single IP address within the subnet, traffic to that address will not be allowed, because the first rule will block it.  In addition, place rules that target traffic based only on traditional criteria such as ingress/egress interface, and source/destination IP address, port, or Geolocation, ahead of rules that require deep inspection, such as those that apply to user criteria, URL filtering, or application filtering. Because these rules do not require inspection, putting them early can get you quicker access control decisions for matching connections.  For more suggestions, see [Best Practices for Access Control Rule Order](#concept_F36CB276D40F4D9ABBBDB8E771DC32D4). |
| **Step 6** | Pair Block and Allow rules to target subsets of traffic.  For example, it is likely that you want to allow a lot of HTTP/HTTPS traffic, yet block access to some undesirable sites such as pornography or gambling. You can accomplish this by creating the following rules and keeping them sequential within the policy (for example, rules 11 and 12).   * A URL filtering Block rule that targets undesirable URL categories,   applied to the inside security zone (source) and outside security   zone (destination), and any IP address, port, or Geolocation. For   example, Block Botnets, Child Abuse Content, Cryptojacking, DNS   Tunneling, Ebanking Fraud, Exploits, Extreme, Filter Avoidance,   Gambling, Hacking, Hate Speech, High Risk Sites and Locations,   Illegal Activities, Illegal Downloads, Illegal Drugs, Malicious   Sites, Malware Sites, Mobile Threats, P2P Malware Node, Phishing,   Pornography, Spam, Spyware and Adware. * An application filtering Allow rule for the HTTP and HTTPS   applications, applied to the inside security zone (source) and   outside security zone (destination), and any IP address, port, or   Geolocation. After the URL filtering rule blocks access to unwanted   web resources, this rule allows all other HTTP/HTTPS access. |
| **Step 7** | Use advanced next-generation firewall features to target traffic regardless of IP address or port.  Attackers or other bad actors can frequently change IP addresses and ports to evade traditional access control traffic-matching criteria. Instead, use the following next-generation features:   * User criteria—Configure the Identity policy to obtain information   about the user who is initiating the traffic. Ideally, your Active   Directory server organizes users into groups, and you can create   access control rules that allow or block traffic based on user group   membership. For example, allow Engineers to access your development   subnets, but implicitly block anyone who is not in the Engineers   group. Use groups rather than individual user names, so you do not   need to continually update the rules as people are added to the   network. * Application criteria—Use application filtering criteria to allow or   block types of applications. This, if a user changes ports for an   HTTP connection, the system can recognize that it is HTTP, even   though it isn't going to port 80. For more suggestions, see [Best Practices for Application Filtering](#concept_02DF0685418F419EA1CADA6693872521). * URL category and reputation criteria—Use URL filtering based on   category to dynamically allow or block sites based on the type of   site. Within the site type, or category, you can fine-tune your rule   based on whether the site has a reputation as a good actor or a bad   actor. By using category and reputation, you will not need to   constantly adjust your rules as sites change URLs, which you would   have to do if you tried to manually block sites by URL. For more   suggestions, see [Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering](#concept_F6A0AA79F3F54EE7BBFA3646D00596A7).  You can also apply URL   category/reputation filtering rules to the FQDN in a DNS lookup   request. The system can prevent the DNS response for blocked   category/reputation, effectively blocking the user’s connection   attempt. For details, see [Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_144597f9-f18a-47d8-a82e-35a4b93043d5). |
| **Step 8** | Apply intrusion inspection to all of your Allow rules.  One of the powerful aspects of next-generation firewalls is that you can apply intrusion inspection and access control using the same device. Apply an intrusion policy to each Allow rule, so that if an attack does enter your network through a normally benign path, you can catch it and drop the attacking connection.  If your default action is Allow, you can also apply intrusion protection for traffic that matches the default action. |
| **Step 9** | Also configure the Security Intelligence policy to block unwanted IP addresses and URLs.  The Security Intelligence policy is applied before the access control policy, so it can block unwanted connections before your access control rules are even evaluated. This can provide an early block and help you reduce the complexity of your access control rules. |
| **Step 10** | Consider implementing the SSL Decryption policy.  The system cannot perform deep inspection on encrypted traffic. If you configure the SSL Decryption policy, the access control policy is applied to a decrypted version of the traffic. Thus, deep inspection can identify attacks (using the intrusion policy), and rule matching is better because application and URL filtering can be applied more effectively. Any traffic that the access control policy allows is then re-encrypted before being sent out of the device, so the end user does not lose the protection of encryption. |
| **Step 11** | Enable object group search to simplify the deployment of your rules.  Enabling object group search reduces memory requirements for access control policies that include network objects. However, it is important to note that object group search might also decrease rule lookup performance and thus increase CPU utilization. You should balance the CPU impact against the reduced memory requirements for your specific access control policy. In most cases, enabling object group search provides a net operational improvement.  You can set this option using FlexConfig by issuing the object-group-searchaccess-control  command; use the no  form of the command in the negate template. |

* [How Other Security Policies Impact Access Control](#concept_903B1EBDCA764E799E26B92F0CF8D608)

### Access Control Rules and the Default Action

Use the access control
policy to allow or block access to network resources. The policy consists of a
set of ordered rules, which are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied
to traffic is the first one where all the traffic criteria are matched.

You can control access
based on:

* Traditional
  network characteristics such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol,
  ports, and interfaces (in the form of security zones).
* The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the source or destination (in the form of a network object). Traffic matching is
  based on the IP address returned for the name from a DNS lookup.
* The security group tag (SGT) assigned to the source or destination by the Cisco
  Identity Services Engine (ISE).
* The application
  that is being used. You can control access based on the specific application,
  or you can create rules that cover categories of applications, applications
  tagged with a particular characteristic, the type of application (client,
  server, web), or the application's risk or business relevance rating.
* The destination
  URL of a web request, including the generalized category of the URL. You can
  refine category matches based on the public reputation of the target site.
* The URL category and reputation of an FQDN in a DNS lookup request. You can block
  the DNS response for unwanted categories or poor reputations, effectively
  preventing the subsequent connection attempt.
* The user who is
  making the request, or the user groups to which the user belongs.

For unencrypted
traffic that you allow, you can apply IPS inspection to check for threats and
block traffic that appears to be an attack. You can also use file policies to
check for prohibited files or malware.

Any traffic that does
not match an access rule is handled by the access control
Default
Action. If you allow traffic by default, you can apply intrusion
inspection to the traffic. However, you cannot perform file or malware
inspection on traffic handled by the default action.

### Application Filtering

You can use access
control rules to filter traffic based on the application used in the
connection. The system can recognize a wide variety of applications, so that
you do not need to figure out how to block one web application without blocking
all web applications.

For some popular
applications, you can filter on different aspects of the application. For
example, you could create a rule that blocks Facebook Games without blocking
all of Facebook.

You can also create
rules based on general application characteristics, blocking or allowing entire
groups of applications by selecting risk or business relevance, type, category,
or tag.
**However, as you
select categories in an application filter, look over the list of matching
applications to ensure you are not including unintended applications.** For a
detailed explanation of the possible groupings, see
[Application Criteria](#concept_1F51EAD7EE7D4107BCF4547CD8D0653B).

* [Application Control for Encrypted and Decrypted Traffic](#concept_28D9D3ECCAC8424ABF27B39DC3A92311)
* [Filtering on Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) and Modbus Applications (ISA 3000)](#id_110363)
* [Best Practices for Application Filtering](#concept_02DF0685418F419EA1CADA6693872521)

#### Application Control for Encrypted and Decrypted Traffic

If an application uses encryption, the system might not be able to
identify the application.

The system can detect application traffic encrypted with StartTLS,
including SMTPS, POPS, FTPS, TelnetS, and IMAPS. In addition, it can identify
certain encrypted applications based on the Server Name Indication in the TLS
ClientHello message, or the subject distinguished name value from the server
certificate.

Use the application filters dialog box to determine if your application
requires decryption by selecting the following Tags, then examining the list of
applications.

* SSL Protocol—You do not need to decrypt
  traffic tagged as SSL Protocol. The system can recognize this traffic and apply
  your access control action. Access control rules for the listed applications
  should match to expected connections.
* Decrypted Traffic—The system can recognize this traffic only if you first decrypt the traffic. Configure SSL decryption rules for this traffic.

#### Filtering on Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) and Modbus Applications (ISA 3000)

You can enable the Common Industrial Protocl (CIP) and Modbus pre-processors on Cisco ISA 3000 devices, and filter on CIP and Modbus applications in access control rules. All CIP application names start with “CIP,” such
as CIP Write. There is only one application for Modbus.

To enable the pre-processors, you must go into expert mode in a CLI session (SSH or Console) and issue the following command
to enable one or both of these Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) applications.

sudo /usr/local/sf/bin/enable\_scada.sh {cip | modbus | both}

For example, to enable both pre-processors:

```

> expert
admin@firepower:~$ sudo /usr/local/sf/bin/enable_scada.sh both

```

| **Note** | ---   You must issue this command after every deployment. These pre-processors are disabled during deployment.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Best Practices for Application Filtering

Please keep the
following recommendations in mind when designing your application filtering
access control rules.

* To handle traffic
  referred by a web server, such as advertisement traffic, match the referred
  application rather than the referring application.
* Avoid combining
  application and URL criteria in the same rule, especially for encrypted
  traffic.
* If you write a
  rule for traffic that is tagged
  Decrypted Traffic, ensure that you have an SSL
  Decryption rule that will decrypt the matching traffic. These applications can
  be identified in decrypted connections only.
* TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with
  TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering effectively, the system must obtain a clear-text certificate
  for the server. We recommend that you enable TLS 1.3 Certificate Visibility in the access control settings. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored
  in cache based on the IP address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the
  system uses a TLS 1.2 probe to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification
  without decrypting the connection.
* The system can
  detect multiple types of Skype application traffic. To control Skype traffic,
  choose the Skype tag from the Application Filters list rather than selecting
  individual applications. This ensures that the system can detect and control
  all Skype traffic the same way.
* To control access to Zoho mail, select both the Zoho and Zoho Mail
  applications.

### URL Filtering

You can use access
control rules to filter traffic based on the URL used in an HTTP or HTTPS
connection. Note that URL filtering for HTTP is more straight-forward than it
is for HTTPS, because HTTPS is encrypted.

You can use the
following techniques to implement URL filtering.

* Category and reputation-based URL filtering—With a URL filtering license, you can control access to web sites based on the
  URL’s general classification (category) and risk level (reputation). This is by far the easiest and most effective way to
  block unwanted sites.
* Manual URL
  filtering—With any license, you can manually specify individual URLs, and
  groups of URLs, to achieve granular, custom control over web traffic. The main
  purpose of manual filtering is to create exceptions to category-based block
  rules, but you can use manual rules for other purposes.

The following topics
provide more information on URL filtering.

* [Filtering URLs by Category and Reputation](#concept_2190C5512921483CB9009A9FF5E3AE74)
* [Looking Up the Category and Reputation for a URL](#id_75010)
* [Manual URL Filtering](#concept_BA45929BE1D543DAA1738FE58F5E4C0C)
* [Filtering HTTPS Traffic](#concept_3DF15D5D32444D5DA55001A3D2BF4816)
* [Comparing URL and Application Filtering](#concept_9B9F5E79222E41DB9ED37367A499BE6E)
* [Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering](#concept_F6A0AA79F3F54EE7BBFA3646D00596A7)
* [What the User Sees When You Block Web Sites](#id_40051)

#### Filtering URLs by Category and Reputation

With a URL filtering license, you can control access to web sites based on the category and reputation of the requested URLs:

* Category—A general classification for the URL. For example, ebay.com
  belongs to the Auctions category, and monster.com belongs to the Job Search
  category. A URL can belong to more than one category.
* Reputation—How likely the URL is to be used for purposes that might be against your organization’s security policy. Reputations range from Untrusted (level 1) to Trusted (level 5).

URL categories and reputations help you quickly configure URL filtering. For example, you can use access control to block untrusted URLs in the Illegal Drugs category.

For a description of the categories, see <https://www.talosintelligence.com/categories>.

Using category and reputation data also simplifies policy creation and
administration. Sites that represent security threats, or that serve
undesirable content, might appear and disappear faster than you can update and
deploy new policies. As Cisco updates the URL database with new sites, changed
classifications, and changed reputations, your rules automatically adjust to
the new information. You do not need to edit your rules to account for new
sites.

If you enable regular URL database updates, you can ensure that the
system uses up-to-date information for URL filtering. You can also enable
communications with Cisco Collective Security Intelligence (CSI) to obtain the
latest threat intelligence for URLs with unknown category and reputation. For
more information, see
[Configuring URL Filtering Preferences](fptd-fdm-system.html#id_16177).

| **Note** | ---   To see URL category and reputation information in events and application details, you must create at least one rule with a URL condition.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Looking Up the Category and Reputation for a URL

You can check on the category and reputation for a particular URL. You can go to the URL tab of an access control rule, or
SSL decryption rule, or go to Device > System Settings > URL Filtering Preferences. There, you can enter the URL in the URL to Check field and click Go.

You will be taken to a web site that shows the results of the lookup. You can use this information to help you check the behavior
of your category- and reputation-based URL filtering rules.

If you disagree with the categorization, you can click the Submit a URL Category Dispute in the FDM to tell us what you think.

#### Manual URL Filtering

You can supplement or selectively override category and reputation-based
URL filtering by manually filtering individual URLs or groups of URLs. You can
perform this type of URL filtering without a special license.

For example, you might use access control to block a category of web
sites that are not appropriate for your organization. However, if the category
contains a web site that is appropriate, and to which you want to provide
access, you can create a manual Allow rule for that site and place it before
the Block rule for the category.

To configure manual URL filtering, you create a URL object with the
destination URL. How this URL is interpreted is based on the following rules:

* If you do not include a path (that is, there are no / characters in the URL), the match is based on the server’s hostname
  only. If you include one or more / character, the entire URL string is used for a substring match. Then, a URL is considered
  a match if any of the following are true:

  + The string is at the beginning of the URL.
  + The string follows a dot.
  + The string contains a dot in the beginning.
  + The string follows the :// characters.

  For example, ign.com matches ign.com or www.ign.com, but not versign.com.

  | **Note** | ---   We recommend that you do not use manual URL filtering to block or allow individual web pages or parts of sites (that is, URL strings with / characters), as servers can be reorganized and pages moved to new paths.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* The system
  disregards the encryption protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS). In other words, if you
  block a website, both HTTP and HTTPS traffic to that website is blocked, unless
  you use an application condition to target a specific protocol. When creating a
  URL object, you do not need to specify the protocol when creating an object.
  For example, use example.com rather than http://example.com.
* If you plan to
  use a URL object to match HTTPS traffic in an access control rule, create the
  object using the subject common name in the public key certificate used to
  encrypt the traffic. Also, the system disregards subdomains within the subject
  common name, so do not include subdomain information. For example, use
  example.com rather than www.example.com.

  However, please
  understand that the subject common name in the certificate might be completely
  unrelated to a web site’s domain name. For example, the subject common name in
  the certificate for youtube.com is \*.google.com (this of course might change at
  any time). You will get more consistent results if you use the SSL Decryption
  policy to decrypt HTTPS traffic so that URL filtering rules work on decrypted
  traffic.

  | **Note** | ---   URL objects will not match HTTPS traffic if the browser resumes a TLS session because the certificate information is no longer available. Thus, even if you carefully configure the URL object, you might get inconsistent results for HTTPS connections.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

#### Filtering HTTPS Traffic

Because HTTPS traffic
is encrypted, performing URL filtering directly on HTTPS traffic is not as
straight-forward as it is on HTTP traffic. For that reason, you should consider
using SSL Decryption policies to decrypt all HTTPS traffic that you intend to
filter. That way, the URL filtering access control policies work on decrypted
traffic, and you get the same results you would get for regular HTTP traffic.

However, if you do
intend to allow some HTTPS traffic to pass undecrypted into the access control
policy, you need to understand that rules match HTTPS traffic differently than
they do for HTTP traffic. To filter encrypted traffic, the system determines
the requested URL based on information passed during the SSL handshake: the
subject common name in the public key certificate used to encrypt the traffic.
There might be little or no relationship between the web site hostname in the
URL and the subject common name.

You can improve HTTPS matching for category/reputation
rules if you enable DNS request filtering. The system can determine the category and
reputation during the DNS resolution phase, and block the DNS reply for unwanted
combinations, before the user can start the HTTPS connection attempt. For allowed DNS
responses, the system will have the category/reputation information available for
subsequent HTTPS connections. See [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22).

HTTPS filtering,
unlike HTTP filtering, disregards subdomains within the subject common name. Do
not include subdomain information when manually filtering HTTPS URLs. For
example, use example.com rather than www.example.com. Also, review the content
of the certificates used by the site to ensure you have the right domain, the
one used in the subject common name, and that this name will not conflict with
your other rules (for example, the name for a site you want to block might
overlap with one you want to allow). For example, the subject common name in
the certificate for youtube.com is \*.google.com (this of course might change at
any time).

| **Note** | ---   URL objects will not match HTTPS traffic if the browser resumes a TLS session because the certificate information is no longer available. Thus, even if you carefully configure the URL object, you might get inconsistent results for HTTPS connections.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Controlling Traffic by Encryption Protocol

The system disregards the encryption protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS)
when performing URL filtering. This occurs for both manual and reputation-based
URL conditions. In other words, URL filtering treats traffic to the following
web sites identically:

* http://example.com
* https://example.com

To configure a rule that matches only HTTP or HTTPS traffic, but
not both, either specify the TCP port in the Destination condition or add an
application condition to the rule. For example, you could allow HTTPS access to
a site while disallowing HTTP access by constructing two access control rules,
each with an TCP port or application, and URL, condition.

The first rule allows HTTPS traffic to the website:

* Action: Allow
* TCP port or
  Application: HTTPS (TCP port 443)
* URL: example.com

The second rule blocks HTTP access to the same website:

* Action: Block
* TCP port or
  Application: HTTP (TCP port 80)
* URL: example.com

#### Comparing URL and Application Filtering

URL and application
filtering have similarities. But you should use them for very distinct
purposes:

* URL filtering is
  best used to block or allow access to an entire web server. For example, if you
  do not want to allow any type of gambling on your network, you can create a URL
  filtering rule to block the Gambling category. With this rule, users cannot get
  to any pages on any web server within the category.
* Application
  filtering is useful for blocking specific applications regardless of the
  hosting site, or for blocking specific features of an otherwise allowable web
  site. For example, you could block just the Facebook Games application without
  blocking all of Facebook.

Because combining
application and URL criteria can lead to unexpected results, especially for
encrypted traffic, it is a good policy to create separate rules for URL and
application criteria. If you do need to combine application and URL criteria in
a single rule, you should place these rules after straight-forward
application-only or URL-only rules, unless the application+URL rule is acting
as an exception to a more general application-only or URL-only rule. Because
URL filtering block rules are more broad than application filtering, you should
place them above application-only rules.

If you do combine
application and URL criteria, you might need to monitor your network more
carefully to ensure that you are not allowing access to unwanted sites and
applications.

#### Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering

Please keep the
following recommendations in mind when designing your URL filtering access
control rules.

* Use category and
  reputation blocking whenever possible. This ensures that new sites get blocked
  automatically as they are added to the categories, and that blocking based on
  reputation is adjusted if a site becomes more (or less) reputable.
* When using URL category matching, note that there are cases where the login page for a site is in a different category than
  the site itself. For example, Gmail is in the Web-based Email category, whereas the login page is in the Search Engines and Portals category. If you have different rules with different actions for the categories, you might get unintended results.
* Use URL objects to
  target entire web sites and to make exceptions to category blocking rules. That
  is, to allow specific sites that would otherwise get blocked in a category
  rule.
* If you want to
  manually block a web server (using a URL object), it is much more effective to
  do so in the Security Intelligence policy. The Security Intelligence policy
  drops connections before the access control rules are evaluated, so you get a
  faster, more efficient, block.
* For the most
  effective filtering of HTTPS connections, implement SSL decryption rules to
  decrypt traffic for which you are writing an access control rule. Any decrypted
  HTTPS connections are filtered as HTTP connections in the access control
  policy, so you avoid all of the limitations for HTTPS filtering.
* TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with
  TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering effectively, the system must obtain a clear-text certificate
  for the server. We recommend that you enable TLS 1.3 Certificate Visibility in the access control settings. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored
  in cache based on the IP address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the
  system uses a TLS 1.2 probe to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification
  without decrypting the connection.
* Place URL blocking
  rules before any application filtering rules, because URL filtering blocks
  entire web servers, whereas application filtering targets specific application
  usage regardless of the web server.
* If you want to block high risk sites whose category is unknown, select the Uncategorized category and adjust the reputation slider to Questionable or Untrusted.
* You can improve overall URL filtering efficacy by also enabling DNS request
  filtering. When you use DNS request filtering, the system determines the FQDN’s
  URL category and reputation at DNS lookup time, so the information is available
  if a subsequent HTTP/HTTPS request comes for the same destination. Additionally,
  if you block the category/reputation, the attempted connection gets stopped at
  the DNS request stage, rather than the web-session establishment stage. See
  [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22).

#### What the User Sees When You Block Web Sites

When you block web sites with URL filtering rules, what the user sees
differs based on whether the site is encrypted.

* HTTP connections—The user sees a system default block response page
  instead of the normal browser page for timed out or reset connections. This
  page should make it clear that you blocked the connection on purpose.
* HTTPS (encrypted) connections—The user does not see the system
  default block response page. Instead, the user sees the browser’s default page
  for a secure connection failure. The error message does not indicate the site
  was blocked due to policy. Instead, errors might indicate that there are no
  common encryption algorithms. It will not be obvious from this message that you
  blocked the connection on purpose.

In addition, web sites might be blocked by other access control rules
that are not explicitly URL filtering rules, or even by the default action. For
example, if you block entire networks or geolocations, any web sites on that
network or in that geographic location are also blocked. Users blocked by these
rules may, or may not, get a response page as described in the limitations
below.

If you implement URL filtering, consider explaining to end users what
they might see when a site is intentionally blocked, and what types of site you
are blocking. Otherwise, they might spend a good deal of time troubleshooting
blocked connections.

##### Limitations of HTTP Response Pages

HTTP response pages do not always appear when the system blocks web
traffic.

* The system does not display a response page when web traffic is
  blocked as a result of a promoted access control rule (an early-placed blocking
  rule with only simple network conditions).
* The system does not display a response page when web traffic is
  blocked before the system identifies the requested URL.
* The system does not display a response page for encrypted
  connections blocked by access control rules.

### DNS Request Filtering

You can apply the URL category and reputation database to DNS lookup requests, even for
connection attempts that are not HTTP/HTTPS.

For example, if a user tries to make an FTP connection to www.example.com, you can
configure the system to look up the category and reputation of www.example.com when it
sees the DNS lookup request for that fully-qualified domain name (FQDN). If your DNS/URL
filtering rule for the returned category/reputation is a block rule, the system blocks
the DNS reply. Thus, the user does not get an IP address for the FQDN, and their
connection attempt fails.

By enabling DNS lookup request filtering, you can extend your URL filtering rules to
protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS, and prevent FTP, TFTP, SCP, ICMP, and any other
protocols from establishing a connection to a site that you are blocking for web access.
This works so long as the user uses an FQDN name and thus requires a DNS lookup. If the
user uses an IP address, there is no DNS request and DNS request blocking is not
possible.

For HTTP/HTTPS traffic, doing the category/reputation lookup at DNS request time might
improve system performance, as it can prevent the connection before the attempt to
establish the web session. This might be especially beneficial for HTTPS, which is
encrypted. By denying at the DNS request stage, the system never sees an HTTPS
connection, and thus your decryption rules do not need to be evaluated, nor does the
system need to perform the more difficult task of matching an encrypted session to the
right access control rule.

* [Guidelines for DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_878ba506-40a2-456d-b855-c703c8cae058)
* [Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_144597f9-f18a-47d8-a82e-35a4b93043d5)

#### Guidelines for DNS Request Filtering

Keep the following in mind as you configure DNS request filtering:

* DNS request filtering works on the DNS session only. If you allow the DNS reply
  (that is, the URL filtering rule action is Allow), then the subsequent
  connection that the user establishes with the returned IP address will be
  matched against your access control rules separately. The connection might match
  a different rule, and thus be blocked or allowed for other reasons. For example,
  if you allow an FTP attempt to get an IP address through a DNS lookup, you might
  have another access control rule that prohibits FTP connections, and the
  connection will ultimately be blocked.
* DNS lookup requests that match access control rules that come before your URL/DNS
  request filtering rules will be allowed or blocked according to the matching
  rule. Category/reputation lookup will not be done for these connections.
* This feature requires that you implement URL filtering based on
  category/reputation. You must have the URL filtering license for this type of
  URL filtering. If you have no URL filtering rules based on category/reputation,
  then DNS request filtering is not relevant and you should not enable it.
* Connection events generated by DNS filtering include the following fields of
  special interest: DNS Query, URL Category, and URL Reputation. The DNS Query
  field shows the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for the lookup request. For
  DNS filtering events, the URL field will be blank.
* DNS request filtering uses the URL category and reputation database only. Any URL
  objects or other manual URL filtering defined in a matching access control rule
  are ignored. If you want to implement manual DNS name blocking, use the Security
  Intelligence DNS policy.

#### Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation

The following procedure explains how to implement DNS lookup request filtering.

##### Before you begin

You must enable the URL license if it is not already enabled.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | If necessary, click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button. ) button, select the Reputation Enforcement on DNS Traffic option, and click OK.  This option enables DNS request filtering for the access control policy. The option is enabled by default. |
| **Step 3** | Evaluate existing URL filtering rules, or create new ones, to implement filtering based on URL category and reputation that will also apply to DNS requests.  URL filtering normally applies to HTTP/HTTPS traffic only, so there is no reason to restrict these rules based on application or port. However, if you do have these restrictions, ensure that the rule can also apply to DNS requests:   * On the Source/Destination tab, if the   Destination Ports field has   Any, no change is needed. If you   specified ports, add DNS over UDP and   DNS over TCP to the list. * On the Applications tab, if the application   list simply has Any, no change is needed. If   you specified any applications or application filters, add the   DNS application to the list or filter.   The other DNS-related options are not relevant for this purpose.   For information on creating access control rules, see [Configuring Access Control Rules](#task_68A29B520CFF46608A8E88D8DFE7AEC0). |
| **Step 4** | Evaluate preceding rules to ensure that DNS requests do not match those rules.  Category and reputation determination happens only if the DNS request matches a URL filtering rule that has category and reputation specifications. Any DNS requests that match rules earlier in the access control policy than your URL filtering rule bypass DNS request filtering. Such DNS requests are handled according to the matching rule, either blocked or allowed. |

### Intrusion, File, and Malware Inspection

Intrusion and file
policies work together as the last line of defense before traffic is allowed to
its destination:

* Intrusion policies
  govern the system's intrusion prevention capabilities.
* File policies govern the system's file control and malware defense capabilities.

All other traffic
handling occurs before network traffic is examined for intrusions, prohibited
files, and malware. By associating an intrusion or file policy with an access
control rule, you are telling the system that before it passes traffic that
matches the access control rule's conditions, you first want to inspect the
traffic with an intrusion policy, a file policy, or both.

You can configure
intrusion and file policies on rules that
allow traffic only. Inspection is not performed on
rules set to
trust or
block traffic. In addition, if the default action
for the access control policy is
allow, you can configure an intrusion policy but
not a file policy.

For any single
connection handled by an access control rule, file inspection occurs before
intrusion inspection. That is, the system does not inspect files blocked by a
file policy for intrusions. Within file inspection, simple blocking by type
takes precedence over malware inspection and blocking. Until a file is detected
and blocked in a session, packets from the session may be subject to intrusion
inspection.

| **Note** | ---   By default, the system disables intrusion and file inspection of encrypted payloads. This helps reduce false positives and improve performance when an encrypted connection matches an access control rule that has intrusion and file inspection configured. Inspection works with unencrypted traffic only.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Best Practices for Access Control Rule Order

Rules are applied on a first-match basis, so you must ensure that rules
with highly specific traffic matching criteria appear above policies that have
more general criteria that would otherwise apply to the matching traffic.
Consider the following recommendations:

* Specific rules should come before general rules, especially when the
  specific rules are exceptions to general rules.
* Any rules that drop traffic based on layer-3/4 criteria only (such
  as IP address, security zone, and port number) should come as early as
  possible. We recommend they come before any rule that requires inspection, such
  as those with application or URL criteria, because Layer-3/4 criteria can be
  evaluated quickly and without inspection. Of course, any exceptions to these
  rules must be placed above them.
* Whenever possible, put specific drop rules near the top of the
  policy. This ensures the earliest possible decision on undesirable traffic.
* Any rules that include both application and URL criteria should come
  after straight-forward application-only or URL-only rules, unless the
  application+URL rule is acting as an exception to a more general
  application-only or URL-only rule. Combining application and URL criteria can
  lead to unexpected results, especially for encrypted traffic, so we recommend
  that you create separate rules for URL and application filtering whenever
  possible.

### NAT and Access Rules

Access rules always use the real IP addresses when determining
an access rule match, even if you configure NAT. For example, if you configure
NAT for an inside server, 10.1.1.5, so that it has a publicly routable IP
address on the outside, 209.165.201.5, then the access rule to allow the
outside traffic to access the inside server needs to reference the server’s
real IP address (10.1.1.5), and not the mapped address (209.165.201.5).

### How Other Security Policies Impact Access Control

Other security
policies can affect how access control rules function and match connections. As
you configure your access rules, keep the following in mind:

* SSL
  Decryption policy—The SSL decryption rules are evaluated before
  access control. Thus, if an encrypted connection matches an SSL decryption rule
  that applies some type of decryption, it is the plain text (decrypted)
  connection that is evaluated by the access control policy. The access rules do
  not see the encrypted version of the connection. Additionally, any connections
  that match SSL decryption rules that drop traffic are never seen by the access
  control policy. Finally, any encrypted connection that matches a Do Not Decrypt
  rule is evaluated in its encrypted state.
* Identity policy—Connections are matched to users
  (and thus, user groups) only if there is a user mapping for the source IP
  address. Access rules that key on user or group membership can match only those
  connections for which user identity was successfully collected by your identity
  policy.
* Security Intelligence policy—Any connection that is dropped is never
  seen by the access control policy. Connections that match the do not block list
  are subsequently matched to access control rules and, ultimately, it is the
  access control rule that determines how the connection is handled (allowed or
  dropped).
* VPN (site-to-site or remote access)—VPN traffic is always evaluated against
  the access control policy, and connections are allowed or dropped based on the
  matching rule. However, the VPN tunnel itself is decrypted before the access
  control policy is evaluated. The access control policy evaluates the
  connections that are embedded within the VPN tunnel, not the tunnel itself.

## License Requirements for Access Control

You do not need a special license to use the access control policy.

However, you do need the following licenses for specific features within
the access control policy. For information on configuring licenses, see
[Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

* URL license—To create rules that use URL categories and reputations as match criteria.
* **Threat** license—To configure an intrusion policy on an access rule or the default action. You also need this license to use a file
  policy (the Malware license is also required).
* **Malware** license—To configure a file policy on an access rule. The Threat is also required for file policies.

## Guidelines and Limitations for Access Control Policies

Following are some
additional limitations for access control. Please consider them when evaluating
whether you are getting the expected results from your rules.

* If a URL database update includes added (new, incoming), deprecated (outgoing), or deleted categories, there is a grace period
  for you to make changes to any access control rules that are affected. Impacted rules are marked with informational messages,
  with explanations about the issues that impact the rule and links to the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
  (Talos) web site for more information about the category changes. You need to update the rule so that it uses the appropriate categories
  available in the latest URL database.

  To accommodate the grace period, add the newly added incoming categories to the appropriate rules without removing the outgoing
  deprecated categories: your rules should contain both the new and old categories. The new categories will be effective when
  the old categories are marked for deletion. When the old categories are finally deleted, you need to edit the rules to remove
  the deleted categories and redeploy the configuration. You will be blocked from deploying the configuration until you fix
  any rules that use deleted categories. Click the See Problem Rules link above the table to filter on rules that need attention.
* FDM can download information on up to 50,000 users from the
  directory server. If your directory server includes more than 50,000 user accounts, you will
  not see all possible names when selecting users in an access rule or when
  viewing user-based dashboard information. You can write rules on only those
  names that were downloaded.

  The 50,000 limit also applies to the names associated with groups. If a group has more than 50,000 members, only the 50,000 names that were downloaded can be matched against the group membership.
* If a Vulnerability Database (VDB) update removes (deprecates) applications, you must make changes to any access control rules
  or application filters that use the application that was deleted. You cannot deploy changes until you fix these rules. In
  addition, you cannot install system software updates before fixing the issue. On the Application Filters object page, or the
  Application tab of the rule, these applications say “(Deprecated)” after the application name.
* To use fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) network objects as source or destination criteria, you must also configure DNS for
  the data interfaces on Device > System Settings > DNS Server. The system does not use the management DNS server setting to do lookups for FQDN objects used in access control rules. For
  information on troubleshooting FQDN resolution, see [Troubleshooting General DNS Problems](fptd-fdm-system.html#id_73501).

  Note that controlling access by FQDN is a best-effort mechanism. Consider the following points:

  + Because DNS replies can be spoofed, only use fully trusted internal DNS servers.
  + Some FQDNs, especially for very popular servers, can have multiple and frequently changing IP addresses. Because the system
    uses cached DNS lookup results, users might get new addresses that are not yet in the cache. Thus, it is possible that blocking
    a popular site by FQDN will provide inconsistent results.
  + For popular FQDNs, different DNS servers can return a different set of IP addresses. Thus, if your users use a different DNS
    server than the one you configure, FQDN-based access control rules might not apply to all IP addresses for the site that are
    used by your clients, and you will not get the intended results for your rules.
  + Some FQDN DNS entries have very short time to live (TTL) values. This can result in frequent recompliation of the lookup table,
    which can impact overall system performance.
* If you edit a rule
  that is actively in use, the changes do not apply to established connections
  that are no longer being inspected by Snort. The new rule is used to match
  against future connections. In addition, if Snort is actively inspecting a
  connection, it can apply the changed matching or action criteria to an existing
  connection. If you need to ensure that your changes apply to all current
  connections, you can log into the device CLI and use the
  clear conn
  command to end established connections, on the assumption that the sources for
  the connections will then attempt to reestablish the connection and thus be
  matched appropriately against the new rule.
* It takes 3 to 5
  packets for the system to identify the application or URL in a connection.
  Thus, the correct access control rule might not be matched immediately for a
  given connection. However, once the application/URL is known, the connection is
  handled based on the matching rule. For encrypted connections, this happens
  after the server certificate exchange in the SSL handshake.
* The system applies
  the default policy action to packets that do not have a payload in a connection
  where an application is identified.
* Leave matching criteria empty whenever possible, especially those for security zones, network objects, and port objects. For
  example, the system can more efficiently match traffic for all interfaces if you simply leave the security zone criteria blank,
  rather than if you create zones that contain all interfaces. When you specify multiple criteria, the system must match against
  every combination of the contents of the criteria you specify.
* If you specify IP addresses for source or destination criteria, do not mix IPv4
  and IPv6 addresses in the same rule. Create separate rules for IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses.
* While operating, the FTD device expands access control rules into multiple access control list entries based on the contents of any network objects
  used in the access rule. You can reduce the memory required to search access control rules by enabling object group search.
  With object group search enabled, the system does not expand network objects, but instead searches access rules for matches
  based on those group definitions. Object group search does not impact how your access rules are defined or how they appear
  in the FDM. It impacts only how the device interprets and processes them while matching connections to access control rules.

  Enabling object group search reduces memory requirements for access control policies that include network objects. However,
  it is important to note that object group search might also decrease rule lookup performance and thus increase CPU utilization.
  You should balance the CPU impact against the reduced memory requirements for your specific access control policy. In most
  cases, enabling object group search provides a net operational improvement.

  You can set this option using FlexConfig by issuing the object-group-searchaccess-control  command; use the no  form of the command in the negate template.
* GRE tunnels that violate the related RFCs will be dropped. For example, if a GRE tunnel contains non-zero values in the reserved
  bits, contrary to the RFCs, it is dropped. If you need to allow non-compliant GRE tunnels, you need to use a remote manager
  and configure a prefilter rule that trusts the sessions. You cannot configure prefilter rules using the FDM.

## Configuring the Access Control Policy

Use the access control
policy to control access to network resources. The policy consists of a set of
ordered rules, which are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied to
traffic is the first one where all the traffic criteria are matched. If no
rules match the traffic, the default action shown at the bottom of the page is
applied.

To configure the
access control policy, select
Policies > Access
Control.

The access control
table lists all rules in order. For each rule:

* Click the
  > button next to the rule number in the left-most
  column to open the rule diagram. The diagram can help you visualize how the
  rule controls traffic. Click the button again to close the diagram.
* Most cells allow
  inline editing. For example, you can click the action to select a different
  one, or click a source network object to add or change the source criteria.
* To move a rule, hover over the rule until you get the move icon (![Move rule icon.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/414001-415000/414046.jpg)),
  then click, drag, and drop the rule to the new location. You can also move a
  rule by editing it and selecting the new location in the
  Order list. It is critical that you put the
  rules in the order that you want them processed. Specific rules should be near
  the top, especially for rules that define exceptions to more general rules
* The right-most
  column contains the action buttons for a rule; mouse over the cell to see the
  buttons. You can edit (![edit icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/400001-410000/409001-410000/409815.jpg))
  or delete (![delete icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/400001-410000/409001-410000/409814.jpg))
  a rule.
* Click the Access Control Settings (![Gear/Settings button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/420001-430000/420001-421000/420147.jpg)) button to configure settings that apply to the access control policy, rather
  than to specific rules within the policy.
* Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (![Toggle hit counts button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/430001-440000/432001-433000/432141.jpg)) above the table to add or remove the Hit Counts column in the table. The Hit Count column appears to the right of the Name
  column with the total hit count for the rule and the date and time of the last hit. The hit count information is fetched at
  the time you click the toggle button. Click the refresh icon (![Refresh hit count button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/430001-440000/432001-433000/432142.jpg)) to get the latest information.
* If any rules have problems, for example, because of removed or changed URL categories, click the See Problem Rules link next to the search box to filter the table to show only those rules. Please edit and correct (or delete) these rules,
  so that they will provide the service that you require.

The following topics
explain how to configure the policy.

### Configuring the Default Action

If a connection does
not match a specific access rule, it is handled by the default action for the
access control policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click anywhere in the Default Action field. |
| **Step 3** | Select the action to apply to matching traffic.   * Trust—Allow   traffic without further inspection of any kind. * Allow—Allow the   traffic subject to the intrusion policy. * Block—Drop the   traffic unconditionally. The traffic is not inspected. |
| **Step 4** | If the action is Allow, select an intrusion policy.  For an explanation of the policy options, see [Intrusion Policy Settings](#concept_990E998E30CF44F2BBE8D32F6D242E00). |
| **Step 5** | (Optional.) Configure logging for the default action.  You must enable logging for traffic that matches the default action to be included in dashboard data or Event Viewer. See [Logging Settings](#id_10392). |
| **Step 6** | Click OK. |

---

### Configuring Access Control Policy Settings

You can configure settings that apply to the access control policy, rather than to
specific rules within the policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policy > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button.) button. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the settings:   * TLS Server Identity Discovery—TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with   TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering, the system must have a clear-text certificate for the   server. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored in cache based on the IP   address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the system uses a TLS 1.2 probe   to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification. We recommend that   you enable this option to ensure encrypted connections are matched to the right access control rule. The setting obtains the   certificate only; the connection remains encrypted. Enabling this option is sufficient to obtain TLS 1.3 certificates; you   do not need to create a corresponding SSL decryption rule. However, the cached certificates are also used for more effective   decryption rule processing in addition to access control processing. * Reputation Enforcement on DNS Traffic—Enable   this option to apply your URL filtering category and reputation   rules to DNS lookup requests. If the fully-qualified domain name   (FQDN) in the lookup request has a category and reputation that you   are blocking, the system blocks the DNS reply. Because the user does   not receive a DNS resolution, the user cannot complete the   connection. Use this option to apply URL category and reputation   filtering to non-web traffic. For more information, see [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22). |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

---

### Configuring Access Control Rules

Use access control
rules to control access to network resources. Rules in the access control
policy are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied to traffic is the
first one where all the traffic criteria are matched.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do any of the following:   * To create a new rule, click   the   + button. * To edit an existing rule,   click the edit icon (edit icon)   for the rule.   To delete a rule you no longer need, click the delete icon (delete icon) for the rule. |
| **Step 3** | In Order, select where you want to insert the rule in the ordered list of rules.  Rules are applied on a first-match basis, so you must ensure that rules with highly specific traffic matching criteria appear above policies that have more general criteria that would otherwise apply to the matching traffic.  The default is to add the rule to the end of the list. If you want to change a rule's location later, edit this option. |
| **Step 4** | In Title, enter a name for the rule.  The name cannot contain spaces. You can use alphanumeric characters and these special characters: + . \_ - |
| **Step 5** | Select the action to apply to matching traffic.   * Trust—Allow   traffic without further inspection of any kind. * Allow—Allow the   traffic subject to the intrusion and other inspection settings in the policy. * Block—Drop the   traffic unconditionally. The traffic is not inspected. |
| **Step 6** | Define the traffic matching criteria using any combination of the following tabs:   * Source/Destination—The   security zones (interfaces) through which the traffic passes, the IP   addresses or the country or continent (geographical location) for the IP   address, the security group tags (SGT)   assigned to the address, or the protocols and ports used in the   traffic. The default is any zone, address, geographical location, SGT, protocol, and port. See [Source/Destination Criteria](#concept_BA8B7882112F45E09AD00B341C64B871). * Application—The   application, or a filter that defines applications by type, category, tag,   risk, or business relevance. The default is any application. See [Application Criteria](#concept_1F51EAD7EE7D4107BCF4547CD8D0653B). * URL—The URL or URL category of a web or DNS   lookup request. The default is any URL. See [URL Criteria](#concept_885AAC35D2A54D34A1A3B602121818E0). * Users—The identity source, user or user group. Your identity policies determine whether user and group information is available for traffic matching.   You must configure identity policies to use this criteria. See [User Criteria](#id_12066).   To modify a condition, you click the + button within that condition, select the desired object or element, and click OK in the popup dialog box. If the criterion requires an object, you can click Create New Object if the object you require does not exist. Click the x for an object or element to remove it from the policy.  When adding conditions to access control rules, consider the following tips:   * You can   configure multiple conditions per rule. Traffic must match all the conditions   in the rule for the rule to apply to traffic. For example, you can use a single   rule to perform URL filtering for specific hosts or networks. * For each   condition in a rule, you can add up to 50 criteria. Traffic that matches any of   a condition's criteria satisfies the condition. For example, you can use a   single rule to apply application control for up to 50 applications or   application filters. Thus, there is an OR relationship among the items in a   single condition, but an AND relationship between condition types (for example,   between source/destination and application). * Some   features require that you enable the appropriate license. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional.) For policies that use the Allow action, you can configure further inspection on unencrypted traffic. Click one of the following links:   * Intrusion Policy—Select Intrusion Policy > On and select the intrusion inspection policy to inspect traffic   for intrusions and exploits. See [Intrusion Policy Settings](#concept_990E998E30CF44F2BBE8D32F6D242E00). * File Policy—Select the   file policy to inspect traffic for files that contain malware and for files   that should be blocked. See [File Policy Settings](#concept_AD893273F89D45FFA5846A9541E3084D). |
| **Step 8** | (Optional.) Configure logging for the rule.  By default, connection events are not generated for traffic that matches a rule, although file events are generated by default if you select a file policy. You can change this behavior. You must enable logging for traffic that matches the policy to be included in dashboard data or Event Viewer. See [Logging Settings](#id_10392).  Intrusion events are always generated for intrusion rules set to drop or alert regardless of the logging configuration on the matching access rule. |
| **Step 9** | Click OK. |

---

#### Source/Destination Criteria

The Source/Destination criteria of an access rule define the security zones (interfaces) through
which the traffic passes, the IP addresses or the country or continent (geographical
location) for the IP address, the security group
tags (SGT) assigned to the address, or the protocols and ports used in the
traffic. The default is any zone, address, geographical location, SGT, protocol, and port.

To modify a condition,
you click the
+ button within that condition, select the desired
object or element, and click
OK. If the criterion requires an object, you can
click
Create New
Object if the object you require does not
exist. Click the
x for an object or element to remove it from the
policy.

You can use the
following criteria to identify the source and destination to match in the rule.

Source Zones,
Destination Zones

The security
zone objects that define the interfaces through which the traffic passes. You
can define one, both, or neither criteria: any criteria not specified applies
to traffic on any interface.

* To match
  traffic leaving the device from an interface in the zone, add that zone to the
  Destination Zones.
* To match
  traffic entering the device from an interface in the zone, add that zone to the
  Source Zones.
* If you add
  both source and destination zone conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from one of the specified source zones and egress through one of the
  destination zones.

Use this
criteria when the rule should apply based on where the traffic enters or exits
the device. For example, if you want to ensure that all traffic going to inside
hosts gets intrusion inspection, you would select your inside zone as the
Destination Zones while leaving the source zone
empty. To implement intrusion filtering in the rule, the rule action must be
Allow, and you must select an intrusion policy in
the rule.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot mix passive and routed security zones in a single rule. In addition, you can specify passive security zones as source zones only, you cannot specify them as destination zones.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Source Networks,
Destination Networks

The network
objects or geographical locations that define the network addresses or
locations of the traffic.

* To match
  traffic from an IP address or geographical location, configure the
  Source Networks.
* To match traffic to an IP address or geographical location, configure the Destination Networks.
* If you add
  both source and destination network conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from one of the specified IP addresses and be destined for one of the
  destination IP addresses.

When you add
this criteria, you select from the following tabs:

* Network—Select the network objects or groups that define the source or destination IP addresses for the traffic you want to control.
  You can use objects that define the address using the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN); the address is determined through
  a DNS lookup.
* Geolocation—Select the geographical location to
  control traffic based on its source or destination country or continent.
  Selecting a continent selects all countries within the continent. Besides
  selecting geographical location directly in the rule, you can also select a
  geolocation object that you created to define the location. Using geographical
  location, you could easily restrict access to a particular country without
  needing to know all of the potential IP addresses used there.

  | **Note** | ---   To ensure that you are using up-to-date geographical location data to filter your traffic, Cisco strongly recommends that you regularly update the geolocation database (GeoDB).   --- |
  | --- | --- |

Source Ports,
Destination Ports/Protocols

The port objects
that define the protocols used in the traffic. For TCP/UDP, this can include
ports. For ICMP, it can include codes and types.

* To match
  traffic from a protocol or port, configure the
  Source Ports. Source ports can be TCP/UDP only.
* To match
  traffic to a protocol or port, configure the
  Destination Ports/Protocols. If you add only
  destination ports to a condition, you can add ports that use different
  transport protocols. ICMP and other non-TCP/UDP specifications are allowed in
  destination ports only; they are not allowed in source ports.
* To match
  traffic both originating from specific TCP/UDP ports and destined for specific
  TCP/UDP ports, configure both. If you add both source and destination ports to
  a condition, you can only add ports that share a single transport protocol, TCP
  or UDP. For example, you could target traffic from port TCP/80 to port
  TCP/8080.

Source SGT Groups, Destination SGT Groups

The Security Group Tag (SGT) group objects that identify the SGTs assigned to the traffic,
as downloaded from the Identity Services Engine (ISE). You can use these
objects only if you define an ISE identity source; otherwise, this section
will not appear. For detailed information on how to use SGTs for access
control, see [How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags](#id_111477).

* To match traffic whose source has one of the SGT defined in the group, configure the
  Source SGT Groups.
* To match traffic to a destination that has one of the SGT defined in the group, configure
  the Destination SGT Groups.
* If you add both source and destination SGT conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from a source with one of the specified tags and be
  destined for one of the destination tags.

#### Application Criteria

The Application
criteria of an access rule defines the application used in an IP connection, or
a filter that defines applications by type, category, tag, risk, or business
relevance. The default is any application.

Although you can
specify individual applications in the rule, application filters simplify
policy creation and administration. For example, you could create an access
control rule that identifies and blocks all high risk, low business relevance
applications. If a user attempts to use one of those applications, the session
is blocked.

In addition, Cisco
frequently updates and adds additional application detectors via system and
vulnerability database (VDB) updates. Thus, a rule blocking high risk
applications can automatically apply to new applications without you having to
update the rule manually.

You can specify
applications and filters directly in the rule, or create application filter
objects that define those characteristics. The specifications are equivalent,
although using objects can make it easier to stay within the
50-items-per-criteria system limit if you are creating a complex rule.

To modify the
application and filters list, you click the
+ button within the condition, select the desired
applications or application filter objects, which are listed on separate tabs,
and click
OK in the popup dialog box. On either tab, you can
click
Advanced
Filter to select filter criteria or to help you search for specific
applications. Click the
x for an application, filter, or object to remove it
from the policy. Click the
Save As
Filter link to save the combined criteria that is not already an
object as a new application filter object.

| **Note** | ---   If a selected application was removed by a VDB update, “(Deprecated)” appears after the application name. You must remove these applications from the filter, or subsequent deployments and system software upgrades will be blocked.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can use the
following
Advanced
Filter criteria to identify the application or filter to match in
the rule. These are the same elements used in application filter objects.

| **Note** | ---   Multiple selections within a single filter criteria have an OR relationship. For example, Risk is High OR Very High. The relationship between filters is AND, so Risk is High OR Very High, AND Business Relevance is Low OR Very Low. As you select filters, the list of applications in the display updates to show only those that meet the criteria. You can use these filters to help you find applications that you want to add individually, or to verify that you are selecting the desired filters to add to the rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Risks

The likelihood
that the application is used for purposes that might be against your
organization's security policy, from very low to very high.

Business
Relevance

The likelihood
that the application is used within the context of your organization's business
operations, as opposed to recreationally, from very low to very high.

Types

The type of
application:

* Application
  Protocol—Application protocols such as HTTP and SSH, which
  represent communications between hosts.
* Client
  Protocol—Clients such as web browsers and email clients, which
  represent software running on the host.
* Web
  Application—Web applications such as MPEG video and Facebook, which
  represent the content or requested URL for HTTP traffic.

Categories

A general
classification for the application that describes its most essential function.

Tags

Additional
information about the application, similar to category.

For encrypted
traffic, the system can identify and filter traffic using only the applications
tagged
 SSL
Protocol. Applications without this tag can only be detected in
unencrypted or decrypted traffic. Also, the system assigns the
decrypted traffic tag to applications that the
system can detect in decrypted traffic only, not encrypted or unencrypted.

Applications
List (bottom of the display)

This list
updates as you select filters from the options above the list, so you can see
the applications that currently match the filter. Use this list to verify that
your filter is targeting the desired applications when you intend to add filter
criteria to the rule. If your intention is to add specific applications, select
them from this list.

#### URL Criteria

The URL criteria of an
access rule defines the URL used in a web request, or the category to which the
requested URL belongs. For category matches, you can also specify the relative
reputation of sites to allow or block. The default is to allow all URLs.

If you enable DNS lookup request filtering, the category
and reputation settings also apply to the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) in the
lookup request. Only the category and reputation settings apply for DNS request
filtering. Manual URL filtering is ignored.

URL categories and reputations allow you to quickly create URL conditions for access control rules. For example, you could
block all Gambling sites, or untrusted Social Networking sites. If a user attempts to browse to any URL with that category and reputation combination, the session
is blocked.

Using category and
reputation data also simplifies policy creation and administration. It grants
you assurance that the system will control web traffic as expected. Finally,
because Cisco's threat intelligence is continually updated with new URLs, as
well as new categories and risks for existing URLs, you can ensure that the
system uses up-to-date information to filter requested URLs. Malicious sites
that represent security threats such as malware, spam, botnets, and phishing
may appear and disappear faster than you can update and deploy new policies.

To modify the URL
list, you click the
+ button within the condition and select the desired
categories or URLs using one of the following techniques. Click the
x for a category or object to remove it from the
policy.

URL Tab

Click
+, select URL objects or groups, and click
OK. You can click
Create
New URL if the object you require does not exist.

| **Note** | ---   Before configuring URL objects to target specific sites, carefully read the information on manual URL filtering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Categories Tab

Click
+, select the desired categories, and click
OK.

For a description of the categories, see <https://www.talosintelligence.com/categories>.

The default is
to apply the rule to all URLs in each selected category regardless of
reputation. To limit the rule based on reputation, click the down arrow for
each category, deselect the
Any checkbox, and then use the
Reputation slider to choose the reputation level.
The left of the reputation slider indicates sites that will be allowed, the
right side are sites that will be blocked. How reputation is used depends on
the rule action:

* If the rule blocks or monitors web access, selecting a reputation level also selects all reputations more severe than that
  level. For example, if you configure a rule to block or monitor Questionable sites (level 2), it also automatically blocks or monitors Untrusted (level 1) sites.
* If the rule allows web access, selecting a reputation level also selects all reputations less severe than that level. For
  example, if you configure a rule to allow Favorable sites (level 4), it also automatically allows Trusted (level 5) sites.

Select the Include Sites with
Unknown Reputation option to have URLs with unknown
reputation included in the reputation match. New sites typically are
unrated, and there can be other reasons a site's reputation is unknown or
cannot be determined.

Check the Category for a URL

You can check on the category and reputation for a particular URL. Enter the URL in the URL to Check box and click Go. You will be taken to an external website to see the results. If you disagree with a categorization, click the Submit a URL Category Dispute link and let us know.

#### User Criteria

The User criteria of
an access rule defines the user or user group for an IP connection. You must
configure identity policies and the associated directory server to include user
or user group criteria in an access rule.

Your identity policies
determine whether user identity is collected for a particular connection. If
identity is established, the IP address of the host is associated with the
identified user. Thus, traffic whose source IP address is mapped to a user is
considered to be from that user. IP packets themselves do not include user
identity information, so this IP-address-to-user mapping is the best
approximation available.

Because you can add a
maximum of 50 users or groups to a rule, selecting groups usually makes more
sense than selecting individual users. For example, you could create a rule
allowing the Engineering group access to a development network, and create a
subsequent rule that denies all other access to the network. Then, to make the
rule apply to new engineers, you only need to add the engineer to the
Engineering group in the directory server.

You an also select identity sources to apply to all users within that source. Thus, if you support multiple Active Directory
domains, you can provide differential access to resources based on the domain.

To modify the users list, you click the + button within the condition and select the desired identities using one of the following techniques. Click the x for an identity to remove it from the policy.

* Identity Sources—Select an identity source, such as an AD realm or the local user database, to apply the rule to all users obtained from the
  selected sources. If the realm you need does not yet exist, click Create New Identity Realm and create it now.
* Groups—Select the desired user groups. Groups are available only if you configure groups in the directory server. If you select
  a group, the rule applies to any member of the group, including subgroups. If you want to treat a sub-group differently, you
  need to create a separate access rule for the sub-group and place it above the rule for the parent group in the access control
  policy.
* Users—Select individual users. The user name is prefixed with the identity source, such as Realm\username.

  There are some built-in users under the Special-Identities-Realm:

  + Failed
    Authentication—The user was prompted to authenticate, but failed to
    enter a valid username/password pair within the maximum number of allowed
    attempts. Failure to authenticate does not itself prevent the user from
    accessing the network, but you can write an access rule to limit network access
    for these users.
  + Guest—Guest users
    are like Failed Authentication users, except that your identity rule is
    configured to call these users Guest. Guest users were prompted to authenticate
    and failed to do so within the maximum number of attempts.
  + No Authentication
    Required—The user was not prompted to authentication, because the
    user's connections matched identity rules that specified no authentication.
  + Unknown—There is
    no user mapping for the IP address, and there is no record of failed
    authentication yet. Typically, this means that no HTTP traffic has yet been
    seen from that address.

#### Intrusion Policy Settings

Cisco delivers several intrusion policies with the firewall system. The several intrusion policies delivered by Cisco Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos) are designed by the Cisco.Talos set the intrusion and preprocessor rule states and advanced settings. For access control
rules that allow traffic, you can select an intrusion policy to inspect traffic for intrusions and exploits. An intrusion
policy examines decoded packets for attacks based on patterns, and can block or alter malicious traffic.

When running Snort 2, these are the only policies available and you cannot modify
them. However, you can change the
action to take for a given rule, as described in [Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)](fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#task_4D5DD40DDCE0426C8846E5684287E63B).

When running Snort 3, you can select one of these policies, or you can create your
own intrusion policies.

To enable intrusion inspection, select Intrusion Policy > On and select the desired policy. Click the info icon for a policy in
the drop-down list to see a description for each policy.

For more information on the pre-defined policies, see [System-Defined Network Analysis and Intrusion Policies](fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#concept_D681E8E136034A9AA863E8389C2A6C03).

#### File Policy Settings

Use file policies to detect malicious software, or *malware*, using malware defense. You can also use file policies to perform file control, which allows control over all files of a
specific type regardless of whether the files contain malware.

Malware defense uses the AMP
Cloud to retrieve dispositions for possible malware detected in network traffic, and to obtain local malware analysis and file
pre-classification updates. The management interface must have a path to the Internet to reach the AMP
Cloud and perform malware lookups. When the device detects an eligible file, it uses the file's SHA-256 hash value to query the
AMP
Cloud for the file's disposition. The possible dispositions are:

* Malware—The AMP
  Cloud categorized the file as malware. An archive file (e.g. a zip file) is marked as malware if any file within it is malware.
* Clean—The AMP
  Cloud categorized the file as clean, containing no malware. An archive file is marked as clean if all files within it are clean.
* Unknown—The AMP
  Cloud has not assigned a disposition to the file yet. An archive file is marked as unknown if any file within it is unknown.
* Unavailable—The system could not query the AMP
  Cloud to determine the file's disposition. You may see a small percentage of events with this disposition; this is expected behavior.
  If you see a number of "unavailable" events in succession, ensure that the Internet connection for the management address
  is functioning correctly.

##### Available File Policies

You can select one
of the following file policies:

* None—Do not
  evaluate transmitted files for malware and do no file-specific blocking. Select
  this option for rules where file transmissions are trusted or where they are
  unlikely (or impossible), or for rules where you are confident your application
  or URL filtering adequately protects your network.
* Block Malware All—Query the AMP
  Cloud to determine if files traversing your network contain malware, then block files that represent threats.
* Cloud Lookup All—Query the AMP
  Cloudto obtain and log the disposition of files traversing your network while still allowing their transmission.
* (Custom File Policy)—You can create your own file policies using the Firepower Threat Defense API filepolicies resource, and the other FileAndMalwarePolicies resources (such as filetypes, filetypecategories, ampcloudconfig,
  ampservers, and ampcloudconnections). After you create the policies, and deploy changes, you can select your policies when
  editing an access control rule in the FDM. The policy description appears below the policy when you select it.

#### Logging Settings

The logging settings
for an access rule determine whether connection events are issued for traffic
that matches the rule. You must enable logging to see events related to the
rule in the Event Viewer. You must also enable logging for matching traffic to
be reflected in the various dashboards you can use to monitor the system.

You should log
connections according to the security and compliance needs of your
organization. If your goal is to limit the number of events you generate and
improve performance, only enable logging for the connections critical to your
analysis. However, if you want a broad view of your network traffic for
profiling purposes, you can enable logging for additional connections.

| **Caution** | ---   Logging blocked TCP connections during a Denial of Service (DoS) attack can affect system performance and overwhelm the database with multiple similar events. Before you enable logging for a Block rule, consider whether the rule is for an Internet-facing interface or other interface vulnerable to DoS attack.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can configure the
following logging actions.

Select Log Action

You can select
one of the following actions:

* Log at Beginning and End of
  Connection—Issue events at the start and end of a connection.
  Because end-of-connection events contain everything that start-of-connection
  events contain, plus all of the information that could be gleaned during the
  connection, Cisco recommends that you do not select this option for traffic
  that you are allowing. Logging both events can impact system performance.
  However, this is the only option allowed for blocked traffic.
* Log at End of
  Connection—Select this option if you want to enable connection
  logging at the end of the connection, which is recommended for allowed or
  trusted traffic.
* No Logging at
  Connection—Select this option to disable logging for the rule. This
  is the default.

| **Note** | ---   When an intrusion policy invoked by an access control rule detects an intrusion and generates an intrusion event, the system automatically logs the end of the connection where the intrusion occurred, regardless of the logging configuration of the rule. For connections where an intrusion was blocked, the action for the connection in the connection log is Block, with a reason of Intrusion Block, even though to perform intrusion inspection you must use an Allow rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

File Events

Select
Log
Files if you want to enable logging of prohibited files or malware
events. You must select a file policy in the rule to configure this option. The
option is enabled by default if you select a file policy for the rule. Cisco
recommends you leave this option enabled.

When the system detects a prohibited file, it automatically logs one of the following types of event:

* *File events*, which represent detected or blocked files, including malware files.
* *Malware events*, which represent detected or blocked malware files only.
* *Retrospective malware events*, which are generated when the malware disposition for a previously detected file changes.

For connections
where a file was blocked, the action for the connection in the connection log
is
Block even though to perform file and malware
inspection you must use an Allow rule. The connection's Reason is either
File
Monitor (a file type or malware was detected), or
Malware Block or
File
Block (a file was blocked).

Send Connection
Events To

If you want to
send a copy of the events to an external syslog server, select the server
object that defines the syslog server. If the required object does not already
exist, click
Create
New Syslog Server and create it. (To disable logging to a syslog
server, select
Any from the server list.)

Because event
storage on the device is limited, sending events to an external syslog server
can provide more long term storage and enhance your event analysis.

This setting applies to connection events only. To send intrusion events to syslog, configure the server in the intrusion
policy settings. To send file/malware events to syslog, configure the server on Device > System Settings > Logging Settings.

## Monitoring Access Control Policies

The following topics explain how you can monitor the access control policy.

* [Monitoring Access Control Statistics in the Dashboards](#id_92397)
* [Examining Rule Hit Counts](#id_92394)
* [Monitoring Syslog Messages for Access Control](#id_92396)
* [Monitoring Access Control Policies in the CLI](#id_92395)

### Monitoring Access Control Statistics in the Dashboards

Most of the data on the Monitoring dashboards are directly related to your access control policy. See [Monitoring Traffic and System Dashboards](fptd-fdm-monitor.html#id_10212).

* Monitoring > Access And SI Rules shows the most-hit access rules and Security Intelligence rule-equivalents and related statistics.
* You can find general statistics on the Network Overview, Destinations, and Zones, dashboards.
* You can find URL filtering results on the URL Categories and Destinations dashboards. You must have at least one URL filtering policy to see any information on the URL Categories dashboard.
* You can find application filtering results on the Applications and Web Applications dashboards.
* You can find user-based statistics on the Users dashboard. You must implement identity policies to collect user information.
* You can find intrusion policy statistics on the Attackers and Targets dashboards. You must apply an intrusion policy to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
* You can find file policy and malware filtering statistics on the File Logs and Malware dashboards. You must apply a file policy to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
* Monitoring > Events also shows events for connections and data related to the access control rules.

### Examining Rule Hit Counts

You can view the hit count for each access control rule. The hit count indicates how often connections matched the rule. You
can use this information to identify your most active rules and the rules that are less active.

The count is from the last time the system
rebooted, whether from your action or from a system upgrade, or from when you reset
the hit count for a rule or all rules.

You can also see rule hit count information in the device CLI using the show rule hits  command.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (Toggle hit counts button.).  The Hit Count column appears to the right of the Name column with the total hit count for the rule and the date and time of the last hit. The hit count information is fetched at the time you click the toggle button.  You can do the following with the hit count information:   * To the left of the button, you will see information on when the hit count was last updated. Click the refresh icon (Refresh hit count button.) to get the latest numbers. * To open a detailed view of the hit count for a given rule, click the hit count number in the table to open the Hit Count dialog   box. The hit count information includes the number of hits and the date and time of the last connection that matched the rule.   Click the Reset link to reset the counter to zero.  If you want to reset the hit count for all rules at once, open an SSH session to the device and issue the clear rule hits  command. * Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (Toggle hit counts button.) again to remove the hit count column from the table. |

---

### Monitoring Syslog Messages for Access Control

In addition to seeing events in the Event Viewer, you can configure access control rules, intrusion policies, file/malware policies, and Security Intelligence policies to send events to a syslog server. The events use the following message IDs:

* 430001—Intrusion event.
* 430002—Connection event logged at the beginning of a connection.
* 430003—Connection event logged at the end of a connection.
* 430004—File events.
* 430005—Malware events.

### Monitoring Access Control Policies in the CLI

You can also open the CLI console or log into the device CLI and use the following commands to get more detailed information about access control policies and
statistics.

* show access-control-config  displays summary information about the access control rules along with per-rule hit counts.
* show access-list  displays the access control lists (ACLs) that were generated from the access control rules. The ACLs provide an initial filter
  and attempt to provide quick decisions whenever possible, so that connections that should be dropped do not need to be inspected
  (and thus consume resources unnecessarily). This information includes hit counts.
* show rule hits displays consolidated hit counts that are more accurate than the counts shown with show access-control-config and show access-list. If you want to reset the hit count, use the clear rule hits command.
* show snort statistics  displays information about the Snort inspection engine, which is the main inspector. Snort implements application filtering,
  URL filtering, intrusion protection, and file and malware filtering.
* show conn  displays information about the connections currently established through the interfaces.
* show traffic  displays statistics about traffic flowing through each interface.
* show ipv6 traffic  displays statistics about IPv6 traffic flowing through the device.

Following are additional examples.

* [How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags](#id_111477)

### How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags

If you use Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to define and use security group tags (SGT) for classifying traffic in a Cisco
TrustSec network, you can write access control rules that use SGT as matching criteria. Thus, you can block or allow access
based on security group membership rather than IP addresses directly.

* [About Security Group Tags (SGT)](#id_111478)
* [Configure Access Control Based on Security Group Tag (SGT)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_96d60f09-ac6d-4d6a-b99d-2c014e0a7927)

#### About Security Group Tags (SGT)

In Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), you can create security group tags (SGT) and assign host or network IP addresses
to each tag. You can also assign SGTs to user accounts, and the SGT is assigned to the user's traffic. If the switches and
routers in the network are configured to do so, these tags then get assigned to packets as they enter the network controlled
by ISE, the Cisco TrustSec cloud.

When you configure an ISE identity source in the FDM, the Firepower Threat Defense system automatically downloads the list of SGTs from ISE. You can then use SGT as a traffic matching condition in access
control rules.

For example, you could create a Production Users tag, and associate the 192.168.7.0/24 network to the tag. This would be appropriate
if you use that network for user end points, such as laptops, Wi-Fi clients, and so forth. You could create a separate tag
for Production Servers, and assign the IP addresses of the relevant servers or subnet to the tag. Then, in the Firepower Threat Defense, you could allow or block access from the user network to the production servers based on the tag. If you later alter the
host or network addresses associated with the tag in ISE, you do not need to change the access control rule defined for the
Firepower Threat Defense device.

When the Firepower Threat Defense evaluates SGT as a traffic matching criteria for an access control rule, it uses the following priority:

1. The source SGT tag defined in the packet, if any. For the SGT tag to be in the
   packet, the switches and routers in the network must be configured to add them.
   See the ISE documentation for information on how to implement this method.
2. The SGT assigned to the user session, as downloaded from the ISE session directory. You need to enable the option to listen
   to session directory information for this kind of SGT matching, but this option is on by default when you first create the
   ISE identity source. The SGT can be matched to source or destination. Although not required, you would also normally set up
   a passive authentication identity rule, using the ISE identity source along with an AD realm, to collect user identity information.
3. The SGT-to-IP address mapping downloaded using SXP. If the IP address is within the range for an SGT, then the traffic matches
   the access control rule that uses the SGT. The SGT can be matched to source or destination.

   ISE uses the Security-group eXchange Protocol (SXP) to propagate the IP-to-SGT mapping database to network devices. When you
   configure the Firepower Threat Defense device to use an ISE server, you must turn on the option to listen to the SXP topic from ISE. Thus, the Firepower Threat Defense device learns about the security group tags and mappings directly from ISE, and is notified whenever ISE publishes updated
   security group tags and mappings. This ensures that the list of security group tags and mappings stay up-to-date on the device,
   so that the Firepower Threat Defense can effectively enforce the policy defined in ISE.

#### Configure Access Control Based on Security Group Tag (SGT)

To configure access control rules that use security group tags (SGT) as matching
criteria, you must first configure the device to obtain the SGT mappings from an ISE
server.

The following procedure explains the end-to-end process based on the assumption that
you want to get all mappings that are defined in ISE, including SGT-to-IP address
mappings published through SXP. Alternatively:

* If you want to use SGT information in the packets only, and not use mappings
  downloaded from ISE, simply create SGT group dynamic objects and use them as
  source SGT criteria in access control rules. Note that in this case, you can
  use SGT tags as a source condition only; these tags will never match
  destination criteria.
* If you want to use SGT in packets plus user session SGT mappings only, you do
  not need to turn on the option to subscribe to the SXP topic in the ISE
  identity source, nor do you need to configure ISE to publish SXP mappings.
  You can use this information for both source and destination matching
  conditions.

##### Before you begin

The assumption here is that you have already configured Cisco TrustSec in your
network, and you are simply adding the Firepower Threat Defense device as a policy enforcement point. If you have not deployed Cisco TrustSec,
please start with ISE and configure your network, then return to this procedure.
Explaining Cisco TrustSec is outside the scope of this document.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Ensure that SGTs are defined, that ISE is configured correctly to publish the SXP topic, and that any needed static mappings are in place.  See [Configure Security Groups and SXP Publishing in ISE](#id_111604). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Update the Identity Services Engine object to listen to the SXP topic.  You can use ISE to obtain user session SGT mappings, static SGT-to-IP address mappings through SXP, or both. By default, when you configure the ISE identity source, it obtains user session mappings only; you must turn on the option to listen to the SXP topic from ISE.   1. Choose Objects > Identity Sources. 2. Edit the ISE object. If you have not configured one yet, click + > Identity Services Engine and see [Configure Identity Services Engine](fptd-fdm-identity-sources.html#id_71555). 3. Under Subscribe To, select SXP    Topic.  Ensure that Session Directory Topic is also    selected if you are using passive authentication or want user-to-SGT    mappings.     Subscribe to ISE SXP topic. 4. Click OK. |
| **Step 3** | Deploy your changes and wait for the system to download tags and mappings from ISE.  After you configure the ISE identity source and deploy changes, the system retrieves security group tag (SGT) information from the ISE server. The download will not happen until after you deploy changes. |
| **Step 4** | Create the SGT group objects that are required for your access control rules.  You cannot use the information retrieved from ISE directly in an access control rule. Instead, you need to create SGT groups, which refer to the downloaded SGT information. Your SGT groups can refer to more than one SGT, so you can apply policy based on relevant collections of tags if that is appropriate.  The number and contents of the objects depend on the access control rules that you intend to write. Repeat the following process to create all the objects that you need.   1. Choose Objects > SGT Groups. 2. Click + to add a new object, or edit an existing    object. 3. For new objects, enter a name and optionally a description. 4. Under Tags, click + and    select all the tags that should be included in the group.     SGT group dynamic object. 5. Click OK. |
| **Step 5** | Create access control rules that use the SGT group objects.  As an example, the following rule allows traffic from production users to production servers. The rule depends completely on SGT; it is not limited by source/destination interface or any other criteria. Thus, the rule will dynamically apply to traffic as it comes from different interfaces, and as you change security group membership in ISE. If the packet does not explicitly contain a source SGT, source/destination matching will be based on the packet IP addresses compared to the SGT-to-IP address mappings obtained from user session information or from SXP-published mappings.   1. Choose Policies > Access Control. 2. Click + to create a new rule, or edit an    existing rule. 3. Enter a rule name and select Allow as the    action. 4. On the Source/Destination tab, click    + under Source > SGT Groups and select the object you created for production    users. 5. On the Source/Destination tab, click    + under Destination > SGT Groups, and select the object you created for production    servers. 6. Configure other options as needed. For example, you can enable logging    and apply an intrusion policy. 7. Click OK. |
| **Step 6** | Deploy the configuration. |

* [Configure Security Groups and SXP Publishing in ISE](#id_111604)

##### Configure Security Groups and SXP Publishing in ISE

There is a lot of configuration that you must do in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to create the TrustSec policy and
security group tags (SGT). Please look at the ISE documentation for more complete information on implementing TrustSec.

The following procedure picks out the highlights of the core settings you must configure in ISE for the Firepower Threat Defense device to be able to download and apply static SGT-to-IP address mappings, which can then be used for source and destination
SGT matching in access control rules. See the ISE documentation for detailed information.

The screen shots in this procedure are based on ISE 2.4. The exact paths to these
features might change in subsequent releases, but the concepts and requirements will
be the same. Although ISE 2.4 or later is recommended, and preferably 2.6 or later,
the configuration should work starting with ISE 2.2 patch 1.

###### Before you begin

You must have the ISE Plus license to publish SGT-to-IP address static mappings and
to get user session-to-SGT mappings so that the Firepower Threat Defense device can receive them.

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Settings > SXP Settings, and select the Publish SXP Bindings on PxGrid option.  This option makes ISE send the SGT mappings out using SXP. You must select this option for the FTD device to “hear” anything from listing to the SXP topic. This option must be selected for the FTD device to get static SGT-to-IP address mapping information. It is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Turn on Publish SXP Bindings on PxGrid option in ISE. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > SXP > SXP Devices, and add a device.  This does not have to be a real device, you can even use the management IP address of the Firepower Threat Defense device. The table simply needs at least one device to induce ISE to publish the static SGT-to-IP address mappings. This step is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Add an SXP device in ISE. |
| **Step 3** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Components > Security Groups and verify there are security group tags defined. Create new ones as necessary.  Configure security group tags (SGT) in ISE. |
| **Step 4** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Components > IP SGT Static Mapping and map host and network IP addresses to the security group tags.  This step is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Configure IP to SGT static mappings in ISE. |

# **Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Compatibility**

This document lists the Secure Firewall ASA software and
hardware compatibility and requirements.

## ASA and ASDM Compatibility Per Model

This section lists ASA and ASDM compatibility per model.

| **Note** | ---   For guidance on security issues on the ASA, and which releases contain fixes for each issue, see the [ASA Security Advisories](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### ASA 9.22

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.22(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.20 with ASA 9.22. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.22(1.2) with ASDM 7.22(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASA 9.18(x) was the final version for the Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150, and   Security Modules SM-24, SM-36, and SM-44 for the Firepower 9300. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.19(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). See the following   exceptions:    + For the Firepower 1010E, ASDM 7.19(1) is not supported. You must use 7.19(1.90)+     or 7.18(2.1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.18 with ASA 9.19. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.20(1.5) with ASDM 7.20(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |

For example, ASDM 7.17(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). See the following   exceptions:    + For the Firepower 1010E, ASDM 7.19(1) is not supported. You must use 7.19(1.90)+     or 7.18(2.1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.17 with ASA 9.18. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.17(1.2) with ASDM 7.17(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.17(1.13) and 9.18(2) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now   validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run   an older ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be   blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”   will be displayed at the ASA CLI.

## **ASA and VPN Compatibility**

For ASA and VPN compatibility, see [Supported VPN Platforms, Cisco ASA 5500 Series](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asa-vpn-compatibility.html).

## Firepower 4100/9300 Compatibility with ASA and Threat Defense

For the Firepower 4100/9300, you must maintain compatibility between FXOS and all ASA and
threat
defense logical devices. Upgrade FXOS before you upgrade the sofware. The **bold** versions
the the following table are specially-qualified (enhanced testing) companion releases. Use
these combinations whenever
possible.

Note that for other device models, the FXOS compatibility work is done for you. In most
cases, upgrading the software automatically upgrades
FXOS.
For the Secure Firewall 3100/4200 in multi-instance mode, the management center guides you through upgrading FXOS and then threat
defense.

To upgrade:

* FXOS: From FXOS 2.2.2 and later, you can upgrade directly to
  any higher version. When upgrading from versions earlier than 2.2.2, you need to
  upgrade to each intermediate version. Note that you cannot upgrade FXOS to a version
  that does not support your current logical device version. You will need to upgrade in
  steps: upgrade FXOS to the highest version that supports your current logical device;
  then upgrade your logical device to the highest version supported with that FXOS
  version. For example, if you want to upgrade from FXOS 2.2/ASA 9.8 to FXOS 2.13/ASA
  9.19, you would have to perform the following upgrades:

  1. FXOS 2.2→FXOS 2.11 (the highest version that supports 9.8)
  2. ASA 9.8→ASA 9.17 (the highest version supported by 2.11)
  3. FXOS 2.11→FXOS 2.13
  4. ASA 9.17→ASA 9.19
* Threat Defense: Interim upgrades may be required for threat
  defense, in addition to the FXOS requirements above. For the exact upgrade path, refer to the
  [management center upgrade guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-installation-guides-list.html) for your version.
* ASA: ASA lets you upgrade directly from your current version to any higher version,
  noting the FXOS requirements above.

| **Note** | ---   FXOS 2.8(1.125)+ and later versions do not support ASA 9.14(1) or 9.14(1.10) for ASA SNMP polls and traps; you must use 9.14(1.15)+. Other releases, such as 9.13 or 9.12, are not affected.   --- |

## Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) Compatibility with the ASA

CDO can manage all platforms running ASA 8.4 and later (see [ASA and ASDM Compatibility Per Model](#id_65776)), except for the ASA Services Module (ASASM), which is not
supported by CDO.

CDO can onboard an ASA running ASA 8.3 but cannot deploy changes to it or manage it
in any other way. Support is "read-only."

CDO does not support management of the ASA FirePOWER module, which runs a different
operating system from ASA. You can still use the ASA FirePOWER module in your
system, but you need to manage it separately with Firepower Management Center or
ASDM.

There may be a CDO feature that does not support all versions of ASA, such as ASA
upgrades from pre-9.12 versions. In those cases, the CDO documentation will list any
version exceptions with the prerequisites for that feature.

## ASA REST API Compatibility

This section lists ASA REST API and ASA compatibility.

| **Note** | ---   The REST API is not supported on newer hardware models and is no longer being developed. We recommend that you instead use the ASA HTTP interface for automation. See [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA HTTP Interface for Automation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/misc/http-interface/asa-http-interface.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

The ASA REST API is supported only on the following models starting with 9.3(2) and
ending with 9.16:

* ASA
  Virtual
* Firepower 9300
* ISA 3000
* Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150
* ASA 5585-X
* ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, 5555-X
* ASA 5512-X, 5515-X
* ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, 5516-X

  | **Note** | ---   The ASA 5506-X series does not support the REST API if you are running the FirePOWER module Version 6.0 or later. Disable the ASA REST API using the **no rest-api agent** command.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

## Firepower 2100 Network Module Compatibility

| **Note** | ---   If a network module is listed for multiple Firepower models, and the part number only differs in the model number (FPR*X*K-NM-*module*), then that module is compatible with the other Firepower models. For example, the FPR9K-NM-6X10SR-F module is compatible on the Firepower 2100 (FPR2K-NM-6X10SR-F) and Firepower 4100 (FPR4K-NM-6X10SR-F). See the [FXOS compatibility guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/compatibility/fxos-compatibility.html) for information about Firepower 4100 and 9300 network modules.   --- |

## ASA and Threat Defense Clustering External Hardware Support

Clustering will work with both Cisco and non-Cisco switches from other major
switching vendors with no known interoperability issues if they comply with the
following requirements and recommendations. Clustering is compatible with
technologies such as vPC (Nexus), VSS (Catalyst), and StackWise & StackWise
Virtual (Catalyst).

### Switch Requirements

* All third party switches must be compliant to the IEEE standard (802.3ad) Link Aggregation Control Protocol.
* EtherChannel bundling must be completed within 45 seconds when connected to Firepower devices and 33 seconds when connected
  to ASA devices.
* On the cluster control link, the switch must provide fully unimpeded unicast and broadcast connectivity at Layer 2 between
  all cluster members.
* On the cluster control link, the switch must not impose any limitations on IP addressing or the packet format above Layer
  2 headers.
* On the cluster control link, the switch interfaces must support jumbo frames and be configurable for an MTU above 1600.

### Switch Recommendations

* The switch should provide uniform traffic distribution over the EtherChannel's individual links.
* The switch should have an EtherChannel load-balancing algorithm that provides traffic symmetry.
* The EtherChannel load balance hash algorithm should be configurable using the 5-tuple, 4-tuple, or 2-tuple to calculate the
  hash.

| **Note** | ---   For the Firepower 9300 cluster, intra-chassis clustering can operate with any switch because Firepower 9300-to-switch connections use standard interface types.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Some switches, such as the Nexus series, do not support LACP rate fast when performing in-service software upgrades (ISSUs), so we do not recommend using ISSUs with clustering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The vulnerability is due to improper authorization controls for a specific URL in the web management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could have a twofold impact: the attacker could either change the administrator password, gaining privileged access, or reset the network configuration details, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. In both scenarios, manual intervention is required to restore normal operations.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).  For information about which Cisco WSA releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Email Security Appliance (ESA)   + Content Security Management Appliance (SMA)  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table:       | Cisco AsyncOS for WSA Major Release | First Fixed Software Release |   | --- | --- |   | 10.1 | 10-1-5-004 |   | 10.5 | 11.5.3-016 |   | 11.5 | 11.5.3-016 |   | 11.7 | 11.7.1-006 |   | 11.8 | Not vulnerable. |   | 12 | Not vulnerable. |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

What is Snort?

Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules
that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and
generates alerts for users.

Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses:
As a packet sniffer like tcpdump, as a packet logger — which is useful for network traffic debugging, or it can be
used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. Snort can be downloaded and configured for personal
and business use alike.

What are my options for buying and using Snort?

Once downloaded and configured, Snort rules are distributed in two sets: The “Community Ruleset” and the “Snort Subscriber Ruleset.”

The Snort Subscriber Ruleset is developed, tested, and approved by Cisco Talos. Subscribers to the Snort Subscriber Ruleset will receive the
ruleset in real-time as they are released to Cisco customers. You can download the rules and deploy them in your network through the Snort.org website. The Community Ruleset is developed by the Snort community and QAed by Cisco Talos. It is freely available to all users.

For more information about Snort Subscriber Rulesets available for purchase, please visit the [Snort product page](/products).

## Upgrade Feature History

Table 6. Version 7.0.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Improved FTD upgrade performance and status reporting. | FTD upgrades are now easier faster, more reliable, and take up less disk space. A new Upgrades tab in the Message Center provides further enhancements to upgrade status and error reporting. |
| Easy-to-follow upgrade workflow for FTD devices. | A new device upgrade page (Devices > Device Upgrade) on the FMC provides an easy-to-follow wizard for upgrading Version 6.4+ FTD devices. It walks you through important pre-upgrade stages, including selecting devices to upgrade, copying the upgrade package to the devices, and compatibility and readiness checks.  To begin, use the new Upgrade Firepower Software action on the Device Management page (Devices > Device Management > Select Action).  As you proceed, the system displays basic information about your selected devices, as well as the current upgrade-related status. This includes any reasons why you cannot upgrade. If a device does not "pass" a stage in the wizard, it does not appear in the next stage.  If you navigate away from wizard, your progress is preserved, although other users with Administrator access can reset, modify, or continue the wizard.   | **Note** | You must still use System(system gear icon) > Updates to upload or specify the location of FTD upgrade packages. You must also use the System Updates page to upgrade the FMC itself, as well as all non-FTD managed devices. | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | In Version 7.0, the wizard does not correctly display devices in clusters or high availability pairs. Even though you must select and upgrade these devices as a unit, the wizard displays them as standalone devices. Device status and upgrade readiness are evaluated and reported on an individual basis. This means it is possible for one unit to appear to "pass" to the next stage while the other unit or units do not. However, these devices are still grouped. Running a readiness check on one, runs it on all. Starting the upgrade on one, starts it on all.  To avoid possible time-consuming upgrade failures, *manually* ensure all group members are ready to move on to the next step of the wizard before you click Next. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade more FTD devices at once. | The number of devices you can upgrade at once is now limited by your management network bandwidth—not the system's ability to manage simultaneous upgrades. Previously, we recommended against upgrading more than five devices at a time.   | **Important** | Only upgrades to FTD Version 6.7+ using the FTD upgrade wizard see this improvement. If you are upgrading devices to an older FTD release—even if you are using the new upgrade wizard—we still recommend you limit to five devices at a time. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade different device models together. | You can now use the FTD upgrade wizard to queue and invoke upgrades for all FTD models at the same time, as long as the system has access to the appropriate upgrade packages.  Previously, you would choose an upgrade package, then choose the devices to upgrade using that package. That meant that you could upgrade multiple devices at the same time *only* if they shared an upgrade package. For example, you could upgrade two Firepower 2100 series devices at the same time, but not a Firepower 2100 series and a Firepower 1000 series. |

Table 7. Version 6.7.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades remove PCAP files to save disk space. | Upgrades now remove locally stored PCAP files. To upgrade, you must have enough free disk space or the upgrade fails. |
| Improved FTD upgrade status reporting and cancel/retry options. | You can now view the status of FTD device upgrades and readiness checks in progress on the Device Management page, as well as a 7-day history of upgrade success/failures. The Message Center also provides enhanced status and error messages.  A new Upgrade Status pop-up, accessible from both Device Management and the Message Center with a single click, shows detailed upgrade information, including percentage/time remaining, specific upgrade stage, success/failure data, upgrade logs, and so on.  Also on this pop-up, you can manually cancel failed or in-progress upgrades (Cancel Upgrade), or retry failed upgrades (Retry Upgrade). Canceling an upgrade reverts the device to its pre-upgrade state.   | **Note** | To be able to manually cancel or retry a failed upgrade, you must disable the new auto-cancel option, which appears when you use the FMC to upgrade an FTD device: Automatically cancel on upgrade failure and roll back to the previous version. With the option enabled, the device automatically reverts to its pre-upgrade state upon upgrade failure.  Auto-cancel is not supported for patches. In an HA or clustered deployment, auto-cancel applies to each device individually. That is, if the upgrade fails on one device, only that device is reverted. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens:   * System(system gear icon) > Updates > Product Updates > Available Updates > Install icon for the FTD upgrade package * Devices > Device Management > Upgrade * Message Center > Tasks   New/modified CLI commands: show upgrade status detail , show upgrade status continuous , show upgrade status , upgrade cancel , upgrade retry |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Custom intrusion rule import warns when rules collide. | The FMC now warns you of rule collisions when you import custom (local) intrusion rules. Previously, the system would silently skip the rules that cause collisions—with the exception of Version 6.6.0.1, where a rule import with collisions would fail entirely.  On the Rule Updates page, if a rule import had collisions, a warning icon is displayed in the Status column. For more information, hover your pointer over the warning icon and read the tooltip.  Note that a collision occurs when you try to import an intrusion rule that has the same SID/revision number as an existing rule. You should always make sure that updated versions of custom rules have new revision numbers.  New/modified screens: We added a warning icon to System(system gear icon) > Updates > Rule Updates. |

Table 8. Version 6.6.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Get FTD upgrade packages from an internal web server. | FTD devices can now get upgrade packages from your own internal web server, rather than from the FMC. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth between the FMC and its devices. It also saves space on the FMC.   | **Note** | This feature is supported only for FTD devices running Version 6.6+. It is not supported for upgrades *to* Version 6.6, nor is it supported for the FMC or Classic devices. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens: We added a Specify software update source option to the page where you upload upgrade packages. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic VDB update during initial setup. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically attempts to update the vulnerability database (VDB).  This is a one-time operation. If the FMC has internet access, we recommend you schedule tasks to perform automatic recurring VDB update downloads and installations. |

Table 9. Version 6.5.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic software downloads and GeoDB updates. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically schedules:   * A weekly task to download software updates for the FMC   and its managed devices. * Weekly updates for the GeoDB.   The tasks are scheduled in UTC, which means that when they occur locally depends on the date and your specific location. Also, because tasks are scheduled in UTC, they do not adjust for Daylight Saving Time, summer time, or any such seasonal adjustments that you may observe in your location. If you are affected, scheduled tasks occur one hour “later” in the summer than in the winter, according to local time. We recommend you review the auto-scheduled configurations and adjust them if necessary. |

Table 10. Version 6.4.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Management Center Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades postpone scheduled tasks. | The FMC upgrade process now postpones scheduled tasks. Any task scheduled to begin during the upgrade will begin five minutes after the post-upgrade reboot.   | **Note** | Before you begin any upgrade, you must still make sure running tasks are complete. Tasks running when the upgrade begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed. | | --- | --- |   Note that this feature is supported for all upgrades *from* a supported version. This includes Version 6.4.0.10 and later patches, Version 6.6.3 and later maintenance releases, and Version 6.7.0+. This feature is not supported for upgrades *to* a supported version from an unsupported version. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Signed SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates. | So the system can verify that you are using the correct update files, Version 6.4+ uses *signed* updates for intrusion rules (SRU), the vulnerability database (VDB), and the geolocation database (GeoDB). Earlier versions continue to use unsigned updates.  Unless you manually download updates from the Cisco Support & Download site—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—you should not notice any difference in functionality. If, however, you do manually download and install SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates, make sure you download the correct package for your current version.  Signed update files begin with 'Cisco' instead of 'Sourcefire,' and terminate in .sh.REL.tar instead of .sh, as follows:   * SRU:   Cisco\_Firepower\_SRU-*date*-*build*-vrt.sh.REL.tar * VDB:   Cisco\_VDB\_Fingerprint\_Database-4.5.0-*version*.sh.REL.tar * GeoDB:   Cisco\_GEODB\_Update-*date*-*build*.sh.REL.tar   We will provide both signed and unsigned updates until the end-of-support for versions that require unsigned updates. Do not untar signed (.tar) packages. If you accidentally upload a signed update to an older FMC or ASA FirePOWER device, you must manually delete it. Leaving the package takes up disk space, and also may cause issues with future upgrades. |

Table 11. Version 6.2.3 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Device Upgrade** | |
| Copy upgrade packages to managed devices before the upgrade. | You can now copy (or push) an upgrade package from the FMC to a managed device before you run the actual upgrade. This is useful because you can push during times of low bandwidth use, outside of the upgrade maintenance window.  When you push to high availability, clustered, or stacked devices, the system sends the upgrade package to the active/control/primary first, then to the standby/data/secondary.  New/modified screens: System(system gear icon) > Updates |
| **Content Updates** | |
| FMC warns of Snort restart before VDB updates. | The FMC now warns you that Vulnerability Database (VDB) updates restart the Snort process. This interrupts traffic inspection and, depending on how the managed device handles traffic, possibly interrupts traffic flow. You can cancel the install until a more convenient time, such as during a maintenance window.  These warnings can appear:   * After you download and manually install a VDB. * When you create a scheduled task to install the VDB. * When the VDB installs in the background, such as during a   previously scheduled task or as part of a software   upgrade. |
| Deprecated: Geolocation details | In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package mapping IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package containing additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. In January 2024, we stopped providing the IP package. This saves disk space and does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way. Any contextual data is now stale, and upgrading to most later versions deletes the IP package. Options to view contextual data have no effect, and are removed in later versions. |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Policy Deployment

| **Caution** | ---   Do NOT push the FMC deployments over a VPN tunnel that is terminating directly on the Firepower Threat Defense. Pushing the FMC deployments can potentially inactivate the tunnel and disconnect the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.  Recovering the device from this situation can be very disruptive and require executing the disaster recovery procedure. This procedure resets the Firepower Threat Defense configuration to factory defaults by changing manager from FMC to local and configuring the device from beginning. For more information, see [Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel](#ID-2176-0000040d__section_pq5_jly_2tb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

After you configure your deployment, and any time you change that configuration, you must deploy the changes to affected devices.
You can view deployment status in the Message Center.

Deploying updates the following components:

* Device and interface configurations
* Device-related policies: NAT, VPN, QoS, platform settings
* Access control and related policies: DNS, file, identity, intrusion, network analysis, prefilter, SSL
* Network discovery policy
* Intrusion rule
  updates
* Configurations and objects associated with any of these elements

You can configure the system to deploy automatically by scheduling a deploy task or by setting the system to deploy when importing
intrusion rule updates. Automating policy deployment is especially useful if you allow intrusion rule updates to modify system-provided
base policies for intrusion and network analysis. Intrusion rule updates can also modify default values for the advanced preprocessing
and performance options in your access control policies.

In a multidomain deployment, you can deploy changes for any domain where your user account belongs:

* Switch to an ancestor domain to deploy changes to all subdomains at the same time.
* Switch to a leaf domain to deploy changes to only that domain.

### Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes

The following are guidelines for deploying configuration changes.

#### Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel

You can deploy the FMC policy configuration over a VPN tunnel, only if the deployment is for a device that does not terminate the tunnel. The FMC to Firepower Threat Defense management traffic should be its own secure transport SF tunnel and does not need to be over S2S VPN tunnel for any connectivity.

For policy-based VPN tunnel, choose the protected networks on both side to exclude the FMC to Firepower Threat Defense management traffic. For route-based VPN tunnel, configure the routing to exclude the FMC to Firepower Threat Defense management traffic to the VTI interface.

When you push the FMC deployments over the VPN tunnel with the management traffic that is also passing through the tunnel, in the event of any
VPN misconfiguration, it inactivates the tunnel and results in disconnecting the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.

To reinstantiate the tunnel configuration, you can either:

* Remove the sensor from the Firepower Threat Defense and the FMC (resulting in losing all of its configuration), and then add the sensor again to the FMC.

  Or
* Contact Cisco TAC.

  | **Note** | ---   Reinstantiating the tunnel configuration requires overhauling of the system.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

#### Inline vs Passive Deployments

Do not apply inline configurations to devices deployed passively, and vice versa.

#### Time to Deploy and Memory Limitations

The time it takes to deploy depends on multiple factors, including (but not limited to):

* The configurations you send to the device. For example, if you dramatically increase the number of Security Intelligence entries
  you block, deploy can take longer.
* Device model and memory. On lower-memory devices, deploying can take longer.

Do not exceed the capability of your devices. If you exceed the maximum number of rules or policies supported by a target
device, the system displays a warning. The maximum depends on a number of factors—not only memory and the number of processors
on the device, but also on policy and rule complexity. For information on optimizing policies and rules, see [Best Practices for Access Control Rules](best_practices_for_access_control.html#ID-2176-000005b6).

#### Interruptions to Traffic Flow and Inspection During Deploy

When you deploy, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection. Additionally, deploying
some configurations restarts the Snort process, which interrupts traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption
or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) and [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).

For Firepower Threat Defense devices, the Inspect Interruption column in the Deploy dialog warns you when deploying might interrupt traffic flow or inspection. You can either proceed with,
cancel, or delay deployment; see [Restart Warnings for the FTD Devices](#id_65425) for more information.

| **Caution** | ---   We *strongly* recommend you deploy in a maintenance window or at a time when interruptions will have the least impact.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Auto-Enabling Application Detectors

If you are performing application control but disable required detectors, the system automatically enables the appropriate
system-provided detectors upon policy deploy. If none exist, the system enables the most recently modified user-defined detector
for the application.

#### Asset Rediscovery with Network Discovery Policy Changes

When you deploy changes to a network discovery policy, the system deletes and then rediscovers MAC address, TTL, and hops
information from the network map for the hosts in your monitored networks. Also, the affected managed devices discard any
discovery data that has not yet been sent to the FMC.

[Snort® Restart Scenarios](#concept_33516C5D6B574B6888B1A05F956ABDF9)

### Restart Warnings for the FTD Devices

When you deploy, the Inspect Interruption column in the deploy page specifies whether a deployed configuration restarts the Snort process on the Firepower Threat Defense device. When the traffic inspection engine referred to as *the Snort process* restarts, inspection is interrupted until the process resumes. Whether traffic is interrupted or passes without inspection
during the interruption depends on how the device handles traffic. Note that you can proceed with the deployment, cancel the
deployment and modify the configuration, or delay the deployment until a time when deploying would have the least impact on
your network.

When the Inspect Interruption column indicates Yes and you expand the device configuration listing, the system indicates any specific configuration type that would restart
the Snort process with an Inspect
Interruption (![inspect interruption icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/447001-448000/447700.jpg)). When you hover your mouse over the icon, a message informs you that deploying the configuration may interrupt traffic.

The following table summarizes how the deploy page displays inspection interruption warnings.

Table 1. Inspection Interruption Indicators

| Type | Inspect Interruption | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FTD | Inspect Interruption (inspect interruption icon)Yes | At least one configuration would interrupt inspection on the device if deployed, and might interrupt traffic depending on how the device handles traffic. You can expand the device configuration listing for more information. |
| -- | Deployed configurations will not interrupt traffic on the device. |
| Undetermined | The system cannot determine if a deployed configuration may interrupt traffic on the device.  Undetermined status is displayed before the first deployment after a software upgrade, or in some cases during a Support call. |
| Errors (error icon) | The system cannot determine the status due to an internal error.  Cancel the operation and click Deploy again to allow the system to redetermine the Inspect Interruption status. If the problem persists, contact Support. |
| sensor | -- | The device identified as *sensor* is not the Firepower Threat Defense device; the system does not determine if a deployed configuration may interrupt traffic on this device. |

For information on all configurations that restart the Snort process for all device types, see [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).

### Deployment Status

On the Deployment page, the Status column provides the deployment status for each device. If a deployment is in progress, then the live status of the deployment
progress is displayed, else one of the following statuses is displayed:

* Pending—Indicates that there are changes in the device that are to be deployed.
* Warnings or errors—Indicates that the pre-deployment checks have identified warnings or errors for the deployment, and you
  have not proceeded with the deployment. You can continue with the deployment if there are any warnings, but not if there are
  any errors.

  | **Note** | ---   The status column provides the warning or error status only for a single user session on the deployment page. If you navigate away from the page or refresh the page, the status changes to pending.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Failed—Indicates that the previous deployment attempt failed. Click on the status to view the details.
* In queue—Indicates that deployment is initiated, and the system is yet to start the deployment process.
* Completed—Indicates that deployment has completed successfully.

### Deployment Estimate

The Estimate link is available on the Deployment page after you select a device, a policy, or a configuration. Click the Estimate link to get an estimate of the deployment duration. The time duration is a rough estimate (having around 70% accuracy), and
the actual time taken for deployment may vary for a few scenarios. Refer to the deployment duration estimate for deployments
to a few Firepower Threat Defenses. The estimate is dependable for deployments of up to 20 Firepower Threat Defense devices.

When an estimate is not available, it indicates that the data is not available, since the first successful deployment on the
selected device is pending. This situation could occur after the FMC version upgrade or after a fresh installation.

| **Note** | ---   The estimate is incorrect and unreliable for bulk policy changes (in case of bulk policy migrations), and selective deployments because the estimate is based on the heuristic technique.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Deployment Notes

Deployment notes are custom notes that a user can add as part of the deployment, and the deployment notes are optional.

You can view the deployment notes in the Deployment History page. On the Firepower Management Center menu bar, click Deploy and then select Deployment History to view the Deployment Notes column for each job.

Use the Search option on the Deployment History page to search using job name, device name, user name, status, or deployment notes.

### Deployment Preview

Preview provides a snapshot of all the policy and object changes to be deployed on the device. The policy changes include
the new policies, changes in the existing policies, and the deleted policies. The object changes include the added and modified
objects which are used in policies. The unused object changes are not displayed because they are not deployed on the device.

On the Deployment page, the Preview column provides a Preview (![preview icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/448001-449000/448387.jpg)) icon for each listed device. On clicking the preview icon, FMC displays a UI page listing all the policy and object changes. The left pane on the preview page lists all the different policy
types that have changed on the device, organized in a tree structure.

The Filter icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/454001-455000/454938.jpg) provided on the Preview page provides an option to filter the policies at the user level and policy level. Click the Filter icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/454001-455000/454938.jpg). Select the policy or user name, or both, and then click Apply to restrict the displayed listing to only the selected items. To view all the pending deployments, ensure that you click
the Filter icon and select Reset.

The right pane lists all the additions, changes, or deletions in the policy, or the object selected in the left pane. The
two columns on the right pane provide the last deployed configuration settings (in the Deployed Version column) versus the changes that are due for deployment (in the Version on Firewall Management Center column). The last deployed configuration settings are derived from a snapshot of the last saved deployment in the FMC and not from the device. The background colors of the settings are color-coded as per the legend available on the top-right
of the page.

The Modified By column lists the users who have modified, or added the configuration settings. At the policy level, the FMC displays all the users who have modified the policy, and at the rule level, the FMC displays only the last user who has modified the rule.

Deployment preview of changes to Security Intelligence, Geolocation, Sinkhole, and File List objects is supported. For an
explanation of these and other reusable objects supported in the FMC, see the chapter titled [Reusable Objects](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/reusable_objects.html).

You can download a copy of the change log by clicking the Download as PDF button.

| **Note** | ---  * To preview the deploy changes, you require access from the REST API to the FMC. To enable the REST API access, follow the steps in [Enabling REST API Access](system_configuration.html#id_26813). * The preview does not show the reordering of rules across policies.  For DNS policies, reordered rules appear in the preview list as rule additions and deletions. For example, moving a rule from   position 1 to position 3 in the rule order is displayed as if the rule was deleted from position 1 and added as a new rule   in position 3. Similarly, when a rule is deleted, the rules under it are listed as edited rules as they have changed their   positions. The changes are displayed in the final order in which they appear in the policy. * The preview shows all the default values, even when they are not altered, along with the other configured settings when an   interface or a platform settings policy is added for the first time. Similarly, the high availability-related policies and   default values for settings are shown, even when they are not altered, in the first preview after a high availability pair   is configured or disrupted. * Preview is not supported for some objects. * Object additions and attribute changes are displayed in the preview only if the objects are associated with any device or   interface. Object deletions are not displayed. * Preview is not supported for the following policies:    + High availability   + Network discovery   + Network analysis   + Device settings * The change log is not supported on NGIPS devices. * User information at rule level is not available for intrusion policies. * The FMC displays the username as system for the following operations:    + Rollback   + Upgrade   + FTD backup and restore   + SRU update   + LSP update   + VDB update * If you change the FMC name in System > Configuration > Information, the deployment preview does not specify this change, yet it requires deploy.  --- |

### Filter Support for Deployment

The Filter icon (![filter](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/454001-455000/454938.jpg)) provided on the Deployment page provides an option to filter the device listings that are pending deployment. The filter
icon provides options to filter the listings based on selected devices and user names. You can use the filter along with the
search option to narrow down to the required listing.

Click the filter icon (![filter](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/454001-455000/454938.jpg)). Select the device or user name, or both, and then click Apply to restrict the displayed listing to only the selected items. To view all the pending deployments, ensure that you click
the filter icon (![filter](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/454001-455000/454938.jpg)) and select Reset.

### Selective Policy Deployment

| **Caution** | ---   Do NOT push the FMC deployments over a VPN tunnel that is terminating directly on the Firepower Threat Defense. Pushing the FMC deployments can potentially inactivate the tunnel and disconnect the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.  Recovering the device from this situation can be very disruptive and require executing the disaster recovery procedure. This procedure resets the Firepower Threat Defense configuration to factory defaults by changing manager from FMC to local and configuring the device from beginning. For more information, see [Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel](#ID-2176-0000040d__section_pq5_jly_2tb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

The FMC allows you to select a specific policy within the list of all the changes on the device that are due for deployment and deploy
only the selected policy. Selectively deployment is available only for the following policies:

* Access control policies
* Intrusion policies
* Malware and file policies
* DNS policies
* Identity policies
* SSL policies
* QoS policies
* Prefilter policies
* Network discovery
* NAT policies
* Routing policies
* VPN policies

On the deployment page, after you click Expand Arrow
(![expand arrow icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/448001-449000/448385.jpg)) to view device-specific configuration changes, Policy selection
 (![policy selection icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/447001-448000/447698.jpg)) icon is visible. The policy selection icon allows you to select individual policies or configurations to deploy while withholding
the remaining listed changes without deploying them. This option is available only for Firepower Threat Defenses and not for sensors. You can also view the interdependent changes for a certain policy or configuration using this option.
The FMC dynamically detects dependencies in-between policies (for example, between an access control policy and an intrusion policy),
and between the shared objects and the policies. Interdependent changes are indicated using color-coded tags to identify a
set of interdependent deployment changes. When one of the deployment changes is selected, the interdependent changes are automatically
selected.

| **Note** | ---  * When the changes in shared objects are deployed, the impacted policies should also be deployed along with them. When you select   a shared object during deployment, the impacted policies are automatically selected. * Selective deployment is not supported for scheduled deployments and deployments using REST APIs. You can only opt for complete   deployment of all the changes in these cases. * The pre-deployment checks for warnings and errors are performed not only on the selected policies, but on all the policies   that are out-of-date. Therefore, the warnings or errors list shows the deselected policies as well. * Similarly, the Inspect Interruption column indication on the Deployment page considers all out-of-date policies and not just the selected policies. For information   on the Inspect Interruption column, see [Restart Warnings for the FTD Devices](#id_65425).  --- |
| --- | --- |

There are certain limitations to selectively deploying policies. Follow the contents in the table below to understand when
selective policy deployment can be used.

Table 2. Limitations for Selective Deployment

| Type | Description | Scenarios |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full deployment | Full deployment is necessary for specific deploy scenarios, and the FMC does not support selective deployment in such scenarios. If you encounter an error in such scenarios, you may choose to proceed by selecting all the changes for deployment on the device. | Scenarios wherein a full deployment is required are:   * The first deployment after you have upgraded the Firepower Threat Defense or FMC. * The first deployment after you have restored the Firepower Threat Defense. * The first deployment after modifications in the Firepower Threat Defense interface settings. * The first deployment after modifications in the virtual router settings. * When the Firepower Threat Defense device is moved to a new domain (global to sub-domain or sub-domain to global). |
| Associated policy deployment | The FMC identifies interdependent policies which are interlinked. When one of the interlinked policies is selected, the remaining interlinked policies are automatically selected. | Scenarios wherein an associated policy is automatically selected:   * When a new object is associated with an existing policy. * When an existing policy's object is modified.   Scenarios wherein multiple policies are automatically selected:   * When a new object is associated with an existing policy, and the same object is already associated with other policies, all   the associated policies are automatically selected. * When a shared object is modified, all the associated policies are automatically selected. |
| Interdependent policy changes (shown using color-coded tags) | The FMC dynamically detects dependencies in-between policies, and between the shared objects and the policies. The interdependency of the objects or policies is shown using color-coded tags. | Scenarios wherein color-coded interdependent policies or objects are automatically selected:   * When all the out-of-date policies have interdependent changes.  For example, when an access control policy, an intrusion policy, and a NAT policy are out-of-date. Since access control policy   and NAT policy share an object, all policies are selected together for deployment. * When all out-of-date policies share an object, and the object is modified. |
| Access Policy Group specifications | Access Policy Group policies are listed together in the preview window under Access Policy Group when you click Show or Hide Policy  (Show or Hide Policy icon). | The scenarios and the expected behavior for Access Policy Group policies are:   * If the access control policy is out-of-date, all other out-of-date policies under this group, except file policy and intrusion   policy, are selected when the access control policy is selected for deployment.  However, if the access control policy is out-of-date, intrusion and file policies can be individually selected or deselected   irrespective of whether the access control policy is selected or not, unless there are any dependent changes. For example,   if a new intrusion policy is assigned to an access control rule, it indicates that there are dependent changes, then both   the access control policy and the intrusion policy will be automatically selected when either of them is selected. * If no access control policy is out-of-date, other out-of-date policies in this group can be selected and deployed individually. |

### Deploy Configuration Changes

| **Caution** | ---   Do NOT push the FMC deployments over a VPN tunnel that is terminating directly on the Firepower Threat Defense. Pushing the FMC deployments can potentially inactivate the tunnel and disconnect the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.  Recovering the device from this situation can be very disruptive and require executing the disaster recovery procedure. This procedure resets the Firepower Threat Defense configuration to factory defaults by changing manager from FMC to local and configuring the device from beginning. For more information, see [Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel](#ID-2176-0000040d__section_pq5_jly_2tb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

After you change configurations, deploy them to the affected devices. We *strongly* recommend that you deploy in a maintenance window or at a time when any interruptions to traffic flow and inspection will
have the least impact.

| **Caution** | ---  When you deploy, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection. Additionally, deploying some configurations restarts the Snort process, which interrupts traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) and [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

* Review the guidelines described in [Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes](#ID-2176-0000040d).
* Be sure all managed devices use the same revision of the Security Zones object. If you have edited security zone objects:
  Do not deploy configuration changes to any device until you edit the zone setting for interfaces on *all* devices you want to sync. You must deploy to all managed devices at the same time. See [Synchronizing Security Zone Object Revisions](classic_device_management_basics.html#ID-2242-0000130d).

| **Note** | ---  Policy deployment process fails if the sensor configuration is being read by the system during deployment. Executing commands such as `show running-config` from the sensor CLI disturbs the deployment, which results in deployment failure.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the FMC menu bar, click Deploy and then select Deployment.  The GUI page lists the devices with out-of-date configurations having the pending status.   * The Modified By column lists the users who have modified the policies or objects. On expanding the device listing, you can view the users   who have modified the policies against each policy listing.       | **Note** | Usernames are not provided for deleted policies and objects. |   | --- | --- | * The Inspect Interruption column indicates if traffic inspection interruption may be caused in the device during deployment. See [Restart Warnings for the FTD Devices](#id_65425) for information to help you identify configurations that interrupt traffic inspection and might interrupt traffic when deployed   to Firepower Threat Defense devices.  If the entry is blank in this column for a device, then it indicates that there will be no traffic inspection interruptions   on that device during deployment. * The Last Modified Time column specifies when you last made the configuration changes. * The Preview column allows you to preview the changes for the next deployment. For more information, see [Deployment Preview](#Cisco_Concept.dita_44f4e6ea-cdb6-41e7-974a-2573b51e3825 "Deployment preview provides a snapshot of all the policy and object changes to be deployed on the device. The policy changes include the new policies, changes in the existing policies, and the deleted policies. The object changes include the added and modified objects which are used in policies."). * The Status column provides the status for each deployment. For more information, see [Deployment Status](#dep_status_estimate_1). |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Identify and choose the devices on which you want to deploy configuration changes.   * Search—Search for the device name, type, domain, group, or status in the search box. * Expand—Click Expand Arrow   (expand arrow icon) to view device-specific configuration changes to be deployed. By selecting the device check box, all the changes for the device, which are listed under the device, are pushed for deployment.   However, you can use the Policy selection    (policy selection icon) to select individual policies or configurations to deploy while withholding the remaining changes without deploying them.   For details, see [Selective Policy Deployment](#select_pol_dep_1).  Optionally, use Show or Hide Policy    (Show or Hide Policy icon) to selectively view or hide the associated unmodified policies.       | **Note** | + When the status in the Inspect Interruption column indicates (Yes) that deploying will interrupt inspection, and perhaps traffic, on a Firepower Threat Defense device, the expanded list indicates the specific configurations causing the interruption with the Inspect   Interruption (inspect interruption icon). + When there are changes to interface groups, security zones, or objects, the impacted devices are shown as out-of-date on the   FMC. To ensure that these changes take effect, the policies with these interface groups, security zones, or objects, also need   to be deployed along with these changes. The impacted policies are shown as out-of-date on the Preview page on the FMC. |   | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) Click Estimate to get a rough estimate of the deployment duration.  For more details, see [Deployment Estimate](#dep_status_estimate_1). |
| **Step 4** | Click Deploy. |
| **Step 5** | If the system identifies errors or warnings in the changes to be deployed, it displays them in the Validation Messages  window. To view complete details, click the arrow icon before the warnings or errors.  You have the following choices:   * Deploy—Continue deploying without resolving warning conditions. You cannot proceed if the system identifies errors. * Close—Exit without deploying. Resolve the error and warning conditions, and attempt to deploy the configuration again. |

---

#### What to do next

* (Optional) Monitor deployment status; see [Viewing Deployment Messages](troubleshooting_the_system.html#task_91DA35534C6A4937BE7F16E770E3C510).
* If deploy fails, see [Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes](#ID-2176-0000040d).
* During deployment, if there is a deployment failure due to any reason, there is a possibility that the failure may impact
  traffic. However, it depends on certain conditions. If there are specific configuration changes in the deployment, the deployment
  failure may lead to traffic being interrupted. See the following table to know what configuration changes may cause traffic
  interruption when deployment fails.

  | Configuration Changes | Exists? | Traffic Impacted? |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | **Threat Defense Service** changes in an access control policy | Yes | Yes |
  | VRF | Yes | Yes |
  | Interface | Yes | Yes |
  | QoS | Yes | Yes |

  | **Note** | ---   The configuration changes interrupting traffic during deployment is valid only if both the FMC and Firepower Threat Defense are of version 6.2.3 or higher.   --- |

### Redeploy Existing Configurations to a Device

You can force-deploy existing (unchanged) configurations to a single managed device. We *strongly* recommend you deploy in a maintenance window or at a time when any interruptions to traffic flow and inspection will have
the least impact.

| **Caution** | ---  When you deploy, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection. Additionally, deploying some configurations restarts the Snort process, which interrupts traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) and [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Review the guidelines described in [Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes](#ID-2176-0000040d).

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Devices > Device Management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Edit (edit icon) next to the device where you want to force deployment.  In a multidomain deployment, if you are not in a leaf domain, the system prompts you to switch. |
| **Step 3** | Click Device. |
| **Step 4** | Click Edit (edit icon) next to the General section heading. |
| **Step 5** | Click Force Deploy (force deploy icon).   | **Note** | Force-deploy takes more time than the regular deployment because it involves the complete generation of the policy rules to be deployed on the FTD. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 6** | Click Deploy.  The system identifies any errors or warnings with the configurations you are deploying. You can click Proceed to continue without resolving warning conditions. However, you cannot proceed if the system identifies an error. |

---

#### What to do next

* (Optional) Monitor deployment status; see [Viewing Deployment Messages](troubleshooting_the_system.html#task_91DA35534C6A4937BE7F16E770E3C510).
* If deploy fails, see [Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes](#ID-2176-0000040d).

### View Deployment History

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the Firepower Management Center menu bar, click Deploy and then select Deployment History.  A list of all the previous deployment and rollback jobs is displayed in reverse chronological order. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Expand Arrow (expand arrow icon) next to the required deployment job to view the devices included in the job and their deployment statuses. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) Click Transcript Details (transcript details icon) to view the commands sent to the device, and the responses received.  The transcript includes the following sections:   * **Snort Apply**—If there are any failures or responses from Snort-related policies, then the messages are displayed in this section. Normally,   the section is empty. * **CLI Apply**—This section covers features that are configured using commands that are sent to the device.       | **Note** | The transcript for the rollback operation does not provide the CLI commands information. To view the rollback commands, see [View the Deployment Rollback Transcript](#view_rollback_transcript). |   | --- | --- | * **Infrastructure Messages**—This section shows the status of different deployment modules.   In the **CLI Apply** section, the deployment transcript includes commands that are sent to the device, and any responses returned from the device. These responses can be informative messages or error messages. For failed deployments, look for messages that indicate errors with the commands. Examining these errors can be particularly helpful if you are using FlexConfig policies to configure customized features. These errors can help you correct the script in the FlexConfig object that is trying to configure the commands.   | **Note** | There is no distinction that is made in the transcript between commands that are sent for managed features and those generated from FlexConfig policies. | | --- | --- |   For example, the following sequence shows that Firepower Management Center (FMC) sent commands to configure GigabitEthernet0/0 with the logical name *outside*. The device responded that it automatically set the security level to 0. Firepower Threat Defense does not use the security level for anything.  ```  ========= CLI APPLY =========  FMC >> interface GigabitEthernet0/0 FMC >>  nameif outside FTDv 192.168.0.152 >> [info] : INFO: Security level for "outside" set to 0 by default.   ``` |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) Click Preview (preview icon) to view the policy and object changes deployed on the device versus the previously deployed version.  The Modified By column lists the users who have modified the policies or objects. At the policy level, FMC displays all the user names who have modified the policy. At the rule level, FMC displays the last user who has modified the rule.  Additionally, to compare any two versions and view the change log, choose the required versions in the drop-down boxes and click the Show button. Click the Download as PDF button to download a copy of the change log.   | **Note** | Deployment history preview is not supported for certificate enrollments, HA operations, and failed deployments. | | --- | --- | |

Click the Download as PDF button to download a copy of the change log.   | **Note** | Deployment history preview is not supported for certificate enrollments, HA operations, and failed deployments. | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | * Deployment history preview is supported for all the deployments done in the FMC 7.0 release only. Preview is not supported   for deployments done prior to 7.0.  * When a device is registered, preview is not supported for the job history record that is created.  * In the deployment history, the last 10 successful deployments, the last 5 failed deployments, and last 5 rollback deployments   are captured. | | --- | --- | |

---

* [HA Scenarios where Preview is not Supported](#HA_Preview_Unsupported)

#### HA Scenarios where Preview is not Supported

Preview is not supported in the following HA scenarios:

* If a device was in standalone mode and if a chain is made, then an auto-deployment is triggered. For that particular job,
  preview is not supported. On hover over the Preview (![preview icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/448001-449000/448387.jpg)), a message is displayed that it is a HA bootstrap deployment, and no preview is supported.
* Configuration groups - Consider a flow in which a device was initially standalone. Subsequently, three deployments took place. In the fourth deployment,
  the device was a HA bootstrap deployement. After these, the user deploys devices 5, 6, and 7. The deployment 7 is an HA break
  deployment, and the user deploys devices 8, 9, and 10.

  In this flow, the preview between 3 and 5 is not supported because 4 was a HA deployment. Similarly, the preview between 8
  and 3 is also not supported. Preview is supported only from 3 to 1, 7,6, 5, 4, and 10, 9, and 8.
* If a device is broken (HA is broken) then the new device is considered as a fresh device.

### Deployment Rollback

| **Caution** | ---   Do NOT push the FMC deployments over a VPN tunnel that is terminating directly on the Firepower Threat Defense. Pushing the FMC deployments can potentially inactivate the tunnel and disconnect the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.  Recovering the device from this situation can be very disruptive and require executing the disaster recovery procedure. This procedure resets the Firepower Threat Defense configuration to factory defaults by changing manager from FMC to local and configuring the device from beginning. For more information, see [Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel](#ID-2176-0000040d__section_pq5_jly_2tb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

Rollback is a deployment functionality provided to clear the existing deployment on an FTD device and to reconfigure the device
with the previously deployed configuration.

After a policy deployment, if the traffic through an FTD is affected in an unintended way, rollback provides an option to
revert the device to the earlier state, which existed before the faulty deployment.

When a deployment has gone awry and caused traffic interruption in an unintended way, it is recommended that you should identify
the change in the deployment that has caused the condition, and fix it. To know the changes in the previous deployment, choose
Deploy > Deployment History, expand the last deployed job, and click the preview icon (![preview icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/448001-449000/448387.jpg)). The preview page provides an option to compare deployments, which can be useful to identify specific changes for a deployment
compared to a previous deployment. After identifying the change causing the problem, rectify the configuration, and redeploy
it on the device. This is the recommended approach. However, if the change causing the problem is unidentifiable, roll back
to the last stable deployed version on the device.

After a successful rollback operation, go to Deploy > Deployment, and click the Preview icon next to the rolled back device. View the changes between the rolled back configuration and the current changes in the
FMC. Identify the change that has caused the issue and rectify it.

Rollback reverts all the configurations on the device except a few. See the table below for details.

| Configurations that are reverted during a rollback | Configurations that are not reverted during a rollback |
| --- | --- |
| * All policy configurations  * Interface configurations  * SRU configurations * VDB configurations * LSP configurations * VPN configurations * FXOS configurations | * Snort binaries       | **Note** | Rollback from Snort 3 to Snort 2 version policies and vice versa are supported. |   | --- | --- | * Geo DB |

| **Important** | ---  * Rollback is a disruptive operation. During this operation, all the existing connections and routes are dropped, and the traffic   is disrupted. Rollback removes the current configuration on all the selected FTD devices and reconfigures them with the chosen   rollback version. * Initiate a rollback during low traffic conditions for optimal performance. * Rollback to a particular version can be performed only once. * Consecutive rollbacks to the same version is not allowed. However, the same version can be selected for rollback at a later   time. * You can roll back to any one of the last 10 versions before the currently deployed version. Rollback to versions prior to   these are not supported. The rollback icon is greyed out for unsupported versions. * Two consecutive rollback operations are not allowed. However, you can rollback again after a deployment. * Rollback reverts the configuration only on the selected FTDs. FMC retains all the changes. With the configuration changes   retained in the FMC, the devices are marked as out-of-date on the FMC after a rollback operation. To see the changes that   are retained in FMC versus the configuration on the device, go to Deploy > Deployment, and click the Preview icon next to the rolled back device. * Be cautious of the changes you want to deploy in the first deployment after you have rolled back, as it would be a full deployment,   and you will not be able to roll back to the rolled back version again. * For FTDs with very large access lists, if the Object Group Search setting is disabled, then the rollback operation may take a longer duration to complete. To verify the Object Group Search setting, go to Devices > Device Management, then select the device and click Edit Advanced Settings.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  * Rollback is supported only on FTD versions 6.7.0 and above. * Rollback is not supported on NGIPS devices. * Rollback is supported for Snort3 policies as well. * Rollback is not supported if the connection interface between the FMC and the FTD is changed from management to data or vice   versa. * In Firepower 4100/9300, when interface changes are made from the Firepower Chassis Manager (FCM) in a previous deployment,   then sync the interfaces using the FCM before initiating a rollback. Failing to do so can cause traffic interruptions. * Independent certificate enrollments are also listed as deployment jobs in the Deployment History page. However, you cannot   rollback to these versions. A rollback from a deployment version created after certificate enrolments reverts the certificate   associations as well. In the next deployment after a rollback, manually associate the certificates before proceeding with   the deployment. * Rollback is not supported on the first version after an upgrade of FMC or FTD. For example, if the FMC is upgraded from 6.7.0   to 6.7.0.1, then you will not be able to roll back to any deployment packages associated with 6.7.0. * If a deployment for a device with a FlexConfig object configured with a deployment frequency set to Once is rolled back, then you will not be able to redeploy the object even though it is displayed as out-of-date on the Preview   page. After a rollback, you will have to manually unassign and then reassign the FlexConfig object to the device before the   next deployment.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Rollback in HA Scenarios

Rollback is not supported in the following HA scenarios:

* When the version you want to roll back to contains the FTD HA bootstrap configuration.
* When the version you want to roll back to contains the FTD HA break configuration.
* When an FTD which is currently in standalone mode, was part of a HA or cluster in the previous deployment version.

#### Rollback in Cluster Scenarios

Rollback is not supported if there are multiple control nodes in a cluster.

#### View the Deployment Rollback Transcript

Rollback transcript is a written version of the commands that are sent to the device, along with the responses returned from
the device. If a rollback operation has failed, the transcript in the Deploy > Deployment History page provides the reason for the failure. However, to know the CLI commands executed for a successful rollback operation,
follow the steps given below after a rollback operation has completed. Note that this information is available only until
the next deployment.

| **Note** | ---   The CLI command information is available after a rollback is complete and is available only until the next deployment. The first deployment after a rollback operation erases all the rollback-related information.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   For any rollback deployment, the Deployment Notes are updated automatically as Rollback Job. In the Deployment History page, the user can filter the Rollback Jobs easily using the Search option.   --- |

### Snort® Restart Scenarios

When the traffic inspection engine referred to as *the Snort process* on a managed device restarts, inspection is interrupted until the process resumes. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles
traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) for more information. Additionally, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection when you deploy, regardless
of whether the Snort process restarts.

Any of the scenarios in the following table cause the Snort process to restart.

Table 3. Snort Restart Scenarios

#### Inspect Traffic During Policy Apply

Inspect traffic during policy apply is an advanced access control policy general setting that allows managed devices to inspect traffic while deploying configuration
changes; this is the case unless a configuration that you deploy requires the Snort process to restart. You can configure
this option as follows:

* Enabled — Traffic is inspected during the deployment unless certain configurations require the Snort process to restart.

  When the configurations you deploy do not require a Snort restart, the system initially uses the currently deployed access
  control policy to inspect traffic, and switches during deployment to the access control policy you are deploying.
* Disabled — Traffic is not inspected during the deployment. The Snort process always restarts when you deploy.

The following graphic illustrates how Snort restarts can occur when you enable or disable Inspect traffic during policy apply.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/400001-410000/407001-408000/407766.jpg)

| **Caution** | ---   When you deploy, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection. Additionally, deploying some configurations restarts the Snort process, which interrupts traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) and [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior

The following tables explain how different devices handle traffic when the Snort process restarts.

Table 4. FTD and FTDv Restart Traffic Effects

| Interface Configuration | Restart Traffic Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| inline: Snort Fail Open: Down: disabled | dropped |
| inline: Snort Fail Open: Down: enabled | passed without inspection  Some packets can be delayed in buffer for several seconds before the system recognizes that Snort is down. This delay can vary depending upon the load distribution. However, the buffered packets are eventually passed. |
| routed, transparent (including EtherChannel, redundant, subinterface): preserve-connection  enabled (configure snort preserve-connection enable ; default)  For more information, see [Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense.html). | existing TCP/UDP flows: passed without inspection so long as at least one packet arrives while Snort is down  new TCP/UDP flows and all non-TCP/UDP flows: dropped  Note that the following traffic drops even when preserve-connection  is enabled:   * plaintext, passthrough prefilter tunnel traffic that   matches an Analyze rule action or an   Analyze all tunnel traffic    default policy action * connections that do not match an access control rule and   are instead handled by the default action. * decrypted TLS/SSL traffic * a safe search flow * a captive portal flow |
| routed, transparent (including EtherChannel, redundant, subinterface): preserve-connection  disabled (configure snort preserve-connection disable ) | dropped |
| inline: tap mode | egress packet immediately, copy bypasses Snort |
| passive | uninterrupted, not inspected |

Table 5. NGIPSv Restart Traffic Effects

| Interface Configuration | Restart Traffic Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| inline: Failsafe enabled or disabled | passed without inspection  A few packets might drop if Failsafe is disabled and Snort is busy but not down. |
| inline: tap mode | egress packet immediately, copy bypasses Snort |
| passive | uninterrupted, not inspected |

Table 6. ASA FirePOWER Restart Traffic Effects

| Interface Configuration | Restart Traffic Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| routed or transparent with fail-open | passed without inspection |
| routed or transparent with fail-close | dropped |

| **Note** | ---  In addition to traffic handling when the Snort process is down while it restarts, traffic can also pass without inspection or drop when the Snort process is busy, depending on the configuration of the Failsafe option (see [Inline Sets](ips_device_deployments_and_configuration.html#ID-2238-0000010e)) or the Snort Fail Open Busy option (see [Configure an Inline Set](inline_sets_and_passive_interfaces_for_firepower_threat_defense.html#task_0E963BC661AA45AF8E7E123430EAA1C4)). A device supports either the Failsafe option or the Snort Fail Open option, but not both.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Warning** | ---  Do not reboot the system while the Snort Rule Update is in progress.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Snort-busy drops happen when snort is not able to process the packets fast enough. Lina does not know whether Snort is busy
due to processing delay, or if is stuck or due to call blocking. When transmission queue is full, snort-busy drops occur.
Based on Transmission queue utilization, Lina will try to access if the queue is being serviced smoothly.

| **Note** | ---  When the Snort process is busy but not down during configuration deployment, some packets may drop on routed, switched, or transparent interfaces if the total CPU load exceeds 60 percent.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated

Deploying any of the following configurations except AAB restarts the Snort process as described. Deploying AAB does not cause
a restart, but excessive packet latency activates the currently deployed AAB configuration, causing a partial restart of the
Snort process.

##### Access Control Policy Advanced Settings

* Deploy when Inspect Traffic During Policy Apply is disabled.
* Add or remove an SSL policy.

##### File Policy

Deploy the first or last of any one of the following configurations; note that while otherwise deploying these file policy
configurations does not cause a restart, deploying non-file-policy configurations can cause restarts.

* Take either of the following actions:

  + Enable or disable Inspect Archives when the deployed access control policy includes at least one file policy.
  + Add the first or remove the last file policy rule when Inspect Archives is enabled (note that at least one rule is required for Inspect Archives to be meaningful).
* Enable or disable Store files in a Detect Files or Block Files rule.
* Add the first or remove the last active file rule that combines the Malware Cloud Lookup or Block Malware rule action with an analysis option (Spero Analysis or MSEXE, Dynamic Analysis, or Local Malware Analysis) or a store files option (Malware,
  Unknown, Clean, or Custom).

Note that access control rules that deploy these file policy configurations to security zones or tunnel zones cause a restart
only when your configuration meets the following conditions:

* Source or destination security zones in your access control rule must match the security zones associated with interfaces
  on the target devices.
* Unless the destination zone in you access control rule is *any*, a source tunnel zone in the rule must match a tunnel zone assigned to a tunnel rule in the prefilter policy.

##### Identity Policy

* When SSL decryption is disabled (that is, when the access control policy does not include an SSL policy), add the first or
  remove the last active authentication rule.

  An active authentication rule has either an Active Authentication rule action, or a Passive Authentication rule action with Use active authentication if passive or VPN identity cannot be established selected.

##### Network Discovery

* Enable or disable non-authoritative, traffic-based user detection over the HTTP, FTP, or MDNS protocols, using the network
  discovery policy.

##### Device Management

* MTU: Change the highest MTU value among all non-management interfaces on a device.
* Automatic Application Bypass (AAB): The currently deployed AAB configuration activates when a malfunction of the Snort process
  or a device misconfiguration causes a single packet to use an excessive amount of processing time. The result is a partial
  restart of the Snort process to alleviate extremely high latency or prevent a complete traffic stall. This partial restart
  causes a few packets to pass without inspection, or drop, depending on how the device handles traffic.

##### Updates

* System update: Deploy configurations the first time after a software update that includes a new version of the Snort binary
  or data acquisition library (DAQ).
* VDB: For managed devices running Snort 2, deploying configurations the first time after installing a vulnerability database
  (VDB) update that includes changes applicable to managed devices will require a detection engine restart and may result in
  a temporary traffic interruption. For these, a message warns you when you select the FMC to begin installing. The deploy dialog provides additional warnings for Firepower Threat Defense devices when VDB changes are pending. VDB updates that apply only to the FMC do not cause detection engine restarts, and you cannot deploy them.

  For managed devices running Snort 3, deploying configurations the first time after installing a vulnerability database (VDB)
  update may temporarily interrupt application detection, but there will be no traffic interruptions.

[Deploy Configuration Changes](#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B)

#### Changes that Immediately Restart the Snort Process

The following changes immediately restart the Snort process without going through the deploy process. How the restart affects traffic depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) for more information.

* Take any of the following actions involving applications or application detectors:

  + Activate or deactivate a system or custom application detector.
  + Delete an activated custom detector.
  + Save and Reactivate an activated custom detector.
  + Create a user-defined application.

  A message warns you that continuing restarts the Snort process, and allows you to cancel; the restart occurs on any managed
  device in the current domain or in any of its child domains.
* Create or break a Firepower Threat Defense high availability pair—A message warns you that continuing to create a high availability pair restarts the Snort process
  on the primary and secondary devices and allows you to cancel.

## Policy Comparison

To review policy
changes for compliance with your organization's standards or to optimize system
performance, you can examine the differences between two policies or between a
saved policy and the running configuration.

You can compare the
following policy types:

* DNS
* File
* Health
* Identity
* Intrusion (Only Snort 2 policies)
* Network Analysis
* SSL

The comparison view
displays both policies in a side-by-side format. Differences between the two
policies are highlighted:

* Blue indicates
  that the highlighted setting is different in the two policies, and the
  difference is noted in red text.
* Green indicates
  that the highlighted setting appears in one policy but not the other.

* [Comparing Policies](#task_ABA1FE48DBBB44BC9FF40243FCC58BF6)

### Comparing Policies

You can compare policies only if you have access rights and any required licenses for
the specific policy, and you are in the correct domain for configuring the policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Access the management page for the policy you want to compare:   * DNS—Policies > Access Control > DNS * File—Policies > Access Control > Malware & File * Health—System > Health > Policy * Identity—Policies > Access Control > Identity * Intrusion—Policies > Access Control > Intrusion      | **Note** | You can compare only Snort 2 policies. |   | --- | --- | * Network Analysis—Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies      | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. |   | --- | --- | * SSL—Policies > Access Control > SSL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Compare Policies. |
| **Step 3** | From the Compare Against drop-down list, choose the type of comparison you want to make:   * To compare two different policies, choose Other Policy. * To compare two revisions of the same policy, choose Other Revision. * To compare another policy to the currently active policy, choose Running Configuration. |
| **Step 4** | Depending on the comparison type you choose, you have the following choices:   * If you are comparing two different policies, choose the policies you want to compare from the Policy A and Policy B drop-down lists. * If you are comparing the running configuration to another policy, choose the second policy from the Policy B drop-down list. |
| **Step 5** | Click OK. |
| **Step 6** | Review the comparison results:   * Comparison Viewer—To use the comparison viewer to navigate individually through policy differences, click Previous or Next above the title bar. * Comparison Report—To generate a PDF report that lists the differences between the two policies, click Comparison Report. |

---

## Policy Reports

For most policies, you can generate
two kinds of reports. A report on a single policy provides details on the
policy's current saved configuration, while a comparison report lists only the
differences between two policies. You can generate a single-policy report for
all policy types except health.

| **Note** | ---   Intrusion policy reports combine the settings in the base policy with the settings of the policy layers, and make no distinction between which settings originated in the base policy or policy layer.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Generating Current Policy Reports](#task_CCED983433824793AF09203FDAD1AF53)

### Generating Current Policy Reports

You can generate policy reports only if you have access rights and any required
licenses for the specific policy, and you are in the correct domain for configuring
the policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Access the management page for the policy for which you want to generate a report:   * Access Control—Policies > Access Control * DNS—Policies > Access Control > DNS * File—Policies > Access Control > Malware & File * Health—System > Health > Policy * Identity—Policies > Access Control > Identity * Intrusion—Policies > Access Control > Intrusion * Network Analysis—Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies      | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. |   | --- | --- | * SSL—Policies > Access Control > SSL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Report (Report icon) next to the policy for which you want to generate a report. |

---

## Out-of-Date Policies

The Firepower System
marks out-of-date policies with red status text that indicates how many of its
targeted devices need a policy update. To clear this status, you must re-deploy
the policy to the devices.

Configuration changes that require a policy re-deploy include:

* Modifying an access control policy: any changes to access
  control rules, the default action, policy targets, Security Intelligence
  filtering, advanced options including preprocessing, and so on.
* Modifying any of the policies that the access control policy
  invokes: the SSL policy, network analysis policies, intrusion policies, file
  policies, identity policies, or DNS policies.
* Changing any reusable object or configuration used in an access
  control policy or policies it invokes:

  + network, port,
    VLAN tag, URL, and geolocation objects
  + Security
    Intelligence lists and feeds
  + application
    filters or detectors
  + intrusion
    policy variable sets
  + file lists
  + decryption-related objects and security zones
* Updating the system software, intrusion rules, or the
  vulnerability database (VDB).

Keep in mind that you can change some of these configurations
from multiple places in the web interface. For example, you can modify security
zones using the object manager (Objects > Object Management),
but modifying an interface type in a device’s configuration (Devices > Device Management)
can also change a zone and require a policy re-deploy.

Note that the following updates do
**not** require policy re-deploy:

* automatic updates to Security Intelligence feeds and additions to the Security Intelligence global Block or Do Not Block list
  using the context menu
* automatic updates to URL filtering data
* scheduled geolocation database (GeoDB) updates

## Performance Considerations for Limited Deployments

Host, application, and user discovery data allow the system to
create a complete, up-to-the-minute profile of your network. The system can
also act as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IPS), analyzing
network traffic for intrusions and exploits and, optionally, dropping offending
packets.

Combining discovery and IPS gives context to your network
activity and allows you to take advantage of many features, including:

* impact flags and indications of compromise, which can tell you
  which of your hosts are vulnerable to a particular exploit, attack, or piece of
  malware
* adaptive profile updates and Firepower recommendations, which allow you to examine traffic differently depending on the destination host
* correlation, which allows you to respond to intrusions (and
  other events) differently depending on the affected host

However, if your organization is interested in performing only
IPS, or only discovery, there are a few configurations that can optimize the
performance of the system.

* [Discovery Without Intrusion Prevention](#ID-2176-00000563)
* [Intrusion Prevention Without Discovery](#ID-2176-00000598)

### Discovery Without Intrusion Prevention

The
*discovery* feature allows you to monitor network traffic and
determine the number and types of hosts (including network devices) on your
network, as well as the operating systems, active applications, and open ports
on those hosts. You can also configure managed devices to monitor user activity
on your network. You can use discovery data to perform traffic profiling,
assess network compliance, and respond to policy violations.

In a basic deployment (discovery and simple, network-based
access control only), you can improve a device’s performance by following a few
important guidelines when configuring its access control policy.

| **Note** | ---   You must use an access control policy, even if it simply allows all traffic. The network discovery policy can **only** examine traffic that the access control policy allows to pass.   --- |
| --- | --- |

First, make sure your access control policy does not require
complex processing and uses only simple, network-based criteria to handle
network traffic. You must implement
**all** of the following guidelines; misconfiguring any one of
these options eliminates the performance benefit:

* Do **not** use the Security Intelligence feature. Remove any populated global Block or Do Not Block list from the policy’s Security
  Intelligence configuration.
* Do
  **not** include access control rules with Monitor or Interactive
  Block actions. Use only Allow, Trust, and Block rules. Keep in mind that
  allowed traffic can be inspected by discovery; trusted and blocked traffic
  cannot.
* Do
  **not** include access control rules with application, user,
  URL, ISE attribute, or geolocation-based network conditions. Use only simple
  network-based conditions: zone, IP address, VLAN tag, and port.
* Do
  **not** include access control rules that perform file, malware,
  or intrusion inspection. In other words, do not associate a file policy or
  intrusion policy with any access control rule.
* In the Advanced settings for the access control policy, make sure that Intrusion Policy used before Access Control rule is determined is set to No Rules Active.
* Select
  Network Discovery Only as the policy’s default
  action. Do
  **not** choose a default action for the policy that performs
  intrusion inspection.

In conjunction with the access control policy, you can configure
and deploy the network discovery policy, which specifies the network segments,
ports, and zones that the system examines for discovery data, as well as
whether hosts, applications, and users are discovered on the segments, ports,
and zones.

[Inspection of Packets That Pass Before Traffic Is Identified](advanced_access_control_settings_for_network_analysis_and_intrusion_policies.html#ID-2194-0000001f)

### Intrusion Prevention Without Discovery

Disabling discovery if you don't need it (for example, in an IPS-only deployment) can improve performance. To disable discovery
you must implement *all* of these changes:

* Delete *all* rules from your network discovery policy.
* Use *only* simple network-based conditions to perform access control: zone, IP address, VLAN tag, and port.

  Do *not* perform any kind of Security Intelligence, application, user, URL, or geolocation control. Although you can disable storage of discovery data, the system still must
  collect and examine it to implement those features.
* Disable network and URL-based Security Intelligence by deleting *all* Block and Do Not Block lists from your access control policy's Security Intelligence configuration, including the default
  Global lists.
* Disable DNS-based Security Intelligence by deleting or disabling *all* rules in the associated DNS policy, including the default Global Do-Not-Block List for DNS and Global Block List for DNS
  rules.

After you deploy, new discovery halts on target devices. The system gradually deletes information in the network map according
to your timeout preferences. Or, you can purge all discovery data immediately.

These vulnerabilities are due to improper management of system resources when the Snort detection engine is processing SMB2 traffic. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a high rate of certain types of SMB2 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the Snort process, resulting in a DoS condition.  **Note**: When the **snort preserve-connection** option is enabled for the Snort detection engine, a successful exploit could also allow the attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network. The **snort preserve-connection** setting is enabled by default. See the [Details](#details) section of this advisory for more information.  **Note**: Only products that have Snort 3 configured are affected. Products that are configured with Snort 2 are not affected.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:[https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-smb-3nfhJtr](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-wsa-unauth-devreset)  This advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.

Log in to the Cisco Defense Orchestrator web interface.   2. From the **Inventory** menu, choose the appropriate Cisco FTD device.   3. In the **Device Details** area, look for **Snort Version**. The version will start with either a *2* for Snort 2 or a *3* for Snort 3.   + If the device is running a Snort 2 version, it is not affected by these vulnerabilities.   + If the device is running a Snort 3 version, it is affected by these vulnerabilities.Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following products:    + Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software   + Cisco Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms   + Cisco Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms   + Cisco Catalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms   + Cisco Catalyst 8500L Series Edge Platforms   + Cisco Cloud Services Routers 1000V   + Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software   + Cisco Meraki MX64 and MX64w Appliances   + Cisco Meraki MX65 and MX65w Appliances   + Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Routers (ISRv)   + Open Source Snort 2  Details  * snort preserve-connection Settings The impact of these vulnerabilities can be twofold, depending on whether the **snort preserve-connection** setting is enabled or disabled and whether a traffic flow began before the Snort process went down or began while the Snort process was down.  The behavior for traffic flows that were established beforethe Snort process went downisconfiguration dependent. The behavior for traffic flows that begin whilethe Snort process is down is notconfiguration dependent and always results in a DoS condition. For details on the **snort preserve-connection** setting, see the [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense/c_3.html#wp1594004510) and the [Snort Restart Traffic Behavior](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/policy_management.html#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) section of the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide. snort preserve-connection Is Enabled When the **snort preserve-connection** option is enabled for the Snort detection engine, existing traffic flow are not dropped when the Snort process goes down. Instead, existing traffic flows bypass the Snort detection engine. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network. Traffic flows that begin while the Snort process is down are dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.  The CVSS score for existing traffic flows is as follows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N  The CVSS score for new traffic flows is as follows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L snort preserve-connection Is Disabled When the **snort preserve-connection** option is disabled for the Snort detection engine, existing traffic flows are dropped. A successful exploit could result in a DoS condition. Traffic flows that begin while the Snort process is down are also dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.  The CVSS score is the same for both new and existing traffic flows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L Determine the Cisco FTD Software Configuration The **snort preserve-connection** setting is enabled by default. To view the current setting, log in to the Cisco FTD Software CLI and use the s**how running-config | include snort** command. There are no GUI options for viewing the setting.  If the command produces the following output, **snort preserve-connection** is enabled on the device:  ```   > show running-config | include snortsnort preserve-connection>   ```  If the command produces the following output, **snort preserve-connection** is disabled on the device:  ```   > show running-config | include snortno snort preserve-connection>   ```  Workarounds  * There is a workaround that addresses these vulnerabilities. To remove the attack vector for these vulnerabilities for Cisco FMC Software-managed devices and Cisco Defense Orchestrator-managed devices, configure a fastpath prefilter rule to bypass the Snort detection engine. To remove the attack vector for these vulnerabilities for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM)-managed devices, configure an access control rule to bypass the Snort detection engine. Workaround for Cisco FMC Software-Managed Devices To configure a fastpath prefilter rule for SMB traffic for Cisco FMC Software-managed devices, do the following:    1. Log in to the FMC web interface.   2. From the **Policies** menu, under the **Access Control** section, choose **Prefilter**.   3. Choose **New Policy**.   4. Enter the **Name** and **Description** and click **Save**.   5. In the resulting window, ensure that **Default Action: Tunnel Traffic** is set to **Analyze all tunnel traffic**.   6. Click **Add Prefilter Rule**.   7. In the resulting window, enter a rule **Name** and ensure the **Enabled** box is checked.   8. From the **Action** drop-down menu, choose **Fastpath**.   9. Configure the policy under the **Interfaces**, **Networks**, and **Vlan Tags** tabs for SMB traffic on the affected network.   10. Click the **Port** tab.   11. Enter the following destination ports for SMB traffic: **TCP (6):138, TCP (6):139, TCP (6):445** and **UDP (17):137**.   12. Click **Add** to add the policy.   13. Click **Save** to save the policy. To associate the SMB prefilter policy with the access control policy deployed on Cisco FMC Software-managed devices, do the following:    1. From the **Policies** menu, under the **Access Control** section, choose **Access Control**.   2. Find the policy of interest.   3. Click the **Edit** icon.   4. Click the name next to **Prefilter Policy**.   5. Choose the name of the newly created SMB prefilter policy from the drop-down menu.   6. Click **OK**.

Workaround for Cisco FDM-Managed Devices Fastpath is not supported on Cisco FDM-managed devices. Instead, set an access control policy with an action of trust for the appropriate ports.  To configure an access control policy to bypass SMB traffic for Cisco FDM-managed devices, do the following:    1. Log in to the Cisco FDM web interface.   2. From the **Policies** menu, choose **Access Control**.   3. Create a new policy by clicking the plus (**+**) sign.   4. Enter a name and under the **Action** drop-down menu, choose **Trust**.   5. In the **Port** section, click the plus (**+**) sign.   6. Select **Create new Port.**   7. Enter aname, protocol type, and port numberfor each of the following ports: **TCP (6):138**, **TCP (6):139**, **TCP (6):445**, and **UDP (17):137**.   8. Once the ports have been created, select the four ports to be added to the rule by selecting their names.   9. Click **OK** when done.   10. Click **OK** to add the policy.   11. Deploy changes to Cisco FTD Software. For more information, see the [Access Control Chapter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/710/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-710/fptd-fdm-access.html) of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager. Workaround for Cisco Defense Orchestrator-Managed Devices To configure a fastpath prefilter rule for SMB traffic for Cisco Defense Orchestrator-managed devices, do the following:    1. Log in to the Cisco Defense Orchestrator web interface.   2. From the **Policies** menu, choose **FTD Policies**.   3. From the **Policies** menu, under the **Access Control** section, choose **Prefilter**.   4. Click **New Policy**.   5. Enter the **Name** and **Description** and click **Save**.   6. In the resulting window, ensure that **Default Action: Tunnel Traffic** is set to **Analyze all tunnel traffic**.   7. Click **Add Prefilter Rule**.   8. In the resulting window, enter a rule **Name** and ensure the **Enabled** box is checked.   9. From the **Action** drop-down menu, select **Fastpath**.   10. Configure the policy under the **Interfaces**, **Networks**, and **Vlan Tags** tabs for SMB traffic on the affected network.   11. Click the **Port** tab.   12. Enter the following destination ports for SMB traffic: **TCP (6):138**, **TCP (6):139**, **TCP (6):445**, and **UDP (17):137**.   13. Click **Add** to add the policy.   14. Click **Save** to save the policy. To associate the SMB prefilter policy with the access control policy deployed on Cisco Defense Orchestrator-managed devices, do the following:    1. From the **Policies** menu, under the **Access Control** section, choose **Access Control.**   2. Find the policy of interest.   3. Click the **Edit** icon.   4. Click the name next to **Prefilter Policy**.   5. Choose the name of the newly created SMB prefilter policy from the drop-down menu.   6. Click **OK**. For more information, see the [Cisco Defense Orchestrator website](https://docs.defenseorchestrator.com/).  While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.
