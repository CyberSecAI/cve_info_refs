**CVE Description:**
The official CVE description is a placeholder, but based on the provided content, we can infer the vulnerability details.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `AT_SKIP_REST` function within the Bluetooth component. The commit message "Security: Fix out of bound read in AT_SKIP_REST" from the associated AOSP code change confirms this root cause.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The vulnerability arises because the code reads beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from memory that should not be accessible leading to high severity information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the system's Bluetooth component, implying an attack vector involving the processing of Bluetooth data, potentially achieved via a malicious crafted bluetooth packet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range to interact with the vulnerable device. No additional privileges are required as stated in the bulletin.
