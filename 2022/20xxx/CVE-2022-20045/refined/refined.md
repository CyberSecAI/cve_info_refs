- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the Bluetooth component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a local service crash, which in turn, can be leveraged to achieve local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is local, and no user interaction is needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be local to the device, but no special execution privileges are required to exploit.
