Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis for CVE-2022-20806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient input validation of user-supplied command arguments in the cluster database API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.
*   **Partial Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting the vulnerability can cause a partial denial of service condition due to the rate at which an attacker can read files.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of sensitive information through the arbitrary file read capability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can obtain sensitive information by reading arbitrary files on the system.
*   A partial Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition can occur due to the resource usage when reading files on the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network.
*   **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the affected device with read/write privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker needs valid credentials with read/write privileges on the Cisco Expressway Series or Cisco TelePresence VCS application.
