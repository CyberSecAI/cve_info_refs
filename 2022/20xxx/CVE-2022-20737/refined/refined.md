Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-20737:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking within the Cisco ASA software when parsing specific HTTP authentication messages. This occurs during the handling of HTTP authentication for resources accessed through the Clientless SSL VPN portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow due to lack of proper bounds checking on specific HTTP authentication messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
- Denial of Service (DoS): Causing the affected device to reload, resulting in a service disruption.
- Information Disclosure: Retrieving bytes from the device's process memory, potentially revealing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to an affected device acting as a VPN gateway.
- The attacker needs to control a web server accessible through the Clientless SSL VPN portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Cisco ASA device.
-   The attacker must control a web server that is accessible via the clientless SSL VPN portal.
-   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious HTTP authentication messages to a vulnerable Cisco ASA device.

**Additional Details:**
-   The vulnerability is specifically within the handler for HTTP authentication for resources accessed via the Clientless SSL VPN portal.
-   The attacker would send malicious HTTP authentication messages through a controlled web server accessed through the Clientless SSL VPN portal of a vulnerable Cisco ASA device.
-   There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability, software updates are required.
-   This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA software with Clientless SSL VPN configured.
-   Cisco has released software updates that address this issue.
-   This advisory is part of the April 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.
-   The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
