Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how the Wi-Fi service handles the reset of Soft Access Point (SAP) configurations during a factory reset. Specifically, the `isUserConfiguration` value was not being correctly reset to default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is an Information Disclosure (ID) issue. The incorrect handling of the `isUserConfiguration` value during a factory reset could expose information about the user's configured settings of the Soft AP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker might be able to gain access to information about the previously configured Soft AP settings. This could potentially be leveraged in other attacks. 

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves gaining access to the device's configurations, specifically the Soft AP settings, after a factory reset.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to have some level of access or control over the device and initiate the factory reset process. They would then need to access or interpret the exposed configuration.

**Additional Notes**
The fix includes resetting the SAP configuration to default and ensuring the isUserConfiguration value is reset correctly during a factory reset. The vulnerability is present in Android versions 10, 11, 12, 12L, and 13. This vulnerability is also listed as part of Google Play system updates.
