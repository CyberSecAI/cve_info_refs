### CVE-2022-20795

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to suboptimal processing when establishing a Datagram TLS (DTLS) tunnel as part of an AnyConnect SSL VPN connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Suboptimal processing of DTLS traffic.
- Inefficient resource utilization during DTLS tunnel establishment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause high CPU utilization, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Existing DTLS tunnels may stop passing traffic.
- New DTLS tunnels cannot be established.
- The affected device will experience socket and crypto failures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a steady stream of crafted DTLS traffic to an affected device.
- This attack is possible on devices configured for termination of DTLS tunnels for AnyConnect SSL VPN connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
- The attacker does not need any authentication credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The device recovers gracefully when the attack traffic stops.
- Proof-of-concept exploit code is available for this vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability; however, disabling DTLS may mitigate it at the cost of reduced performance.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA and FTD software.
- SSL VPN is disabled by default but when enabled on an interface, DTLS is also enabled by default.
- Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software is not affected by the vulnerability.
