Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20457:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an issue related to how the system handles external storage permissions, specifically the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission, during app installation. It is related to legacy permission checks and how the system validates installer apps' access to the obb directory, which are large binary files associated with app installation

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Permission Check:** A flaw exists in the permission check for installers when accessing the obb directory. The legacy `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission was being checked when it shouldn't have been.
- **Potential for privilege escalation**: This incorrect check could lead to an elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability.
- **Access to sensitive data:** The vulnerability could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to data stored in the obb directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local Elevation of Privilege:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges without needing additional execution privileges.
- **Data Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the obb directory.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Application:** The attack vector involves a malicious local application that attempts to access the obb directory using the vulnerable permission check.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the affected device.
- **No Additional Privileges:** The attacker does not need any additional execution privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Android version 13.
- The fix was implemented by removing the legacy `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission check for installers.
- The vulnerability was identified with Android bug ID A-243924784 and is linked to the AOSP commit [80c15ed6591620034386a190d833cee829e4aace](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/80c15ed6591620034386a190d833cee829e4aace)
