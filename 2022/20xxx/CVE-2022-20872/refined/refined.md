Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20872:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided documents confirm that CVE-2022-20872 is related to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) software. The advisory `cisco-sa-fmc-xss-LATZYzxs` specifically mentions this CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco FMC Software.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is a type of XSS where malicious scripts are stored on the server.
    *   Insufficient input validation: The web-based management interface does not properly sanitize user-provided data before displaying it.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   Arbitrary Script Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface, potentially gaining control over a user's browser session and access to sensitive data.
    *   Access to Sensitive Information: The attacker can access sensitive browser-based information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).
    *   Temporary Availability Impact: In some cases, the attacker could cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote, authenticated attacker: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted input via the web-based management interface.
    *  Crafted input into various data fields: The attacker inserts the malicious code into different input fields on the management interface of the affected devices.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be authenticated to the FMC web-based management interface.
    *  The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious input into data fields.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in software updates released by Cisco.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than applying the fix.
*   Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public exploitation of the vulnerability.
*   The advisory also mentions that the vulnerability was found during internal testing and by a third party.

**4. CVSS:**
The base CVSS score is 4.8 with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, which is of medium severity.

**5. Affected Products/Versions:**
