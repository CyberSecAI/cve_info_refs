{
  "CVE-2022-20135": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability in the System component could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.",
    "Root cause": "Inconsistent writeToParcel() and createFromParcel() methods in GateKeeperResponse class allow for a malicious app to create a Bundle that changes its content after serialization which could be used to execute intents with system privileges.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent serialization/deserialization",
      "Improper handling of byte array of size 0 in GateKeeperResponse"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local Elevation of Privilege (EoP)",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious application crafts a specific bundle that exploits the inconsistency in `writeToParcel()` and `createFromParcel()` methods to gain system privileges.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A malicious application installed on the device."
  }
