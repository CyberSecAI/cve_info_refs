Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-20147

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `nfa_dm_check_set_config` function, which is part of the NFC (Near Field Communication) component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability stems from the code reading data beyond the allocated memory boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation could allow a local attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected device. This could potentially give the attacker more control over the system than they should have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attack needs to be executed locally on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the NFC component in a way that triggers the vulnerable code.
- It is a local privilege escalation, so the attacker likely needs some existing access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix is associated with the commit: `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/nfc/%2B/88c5c267e889699c71412022e3fcb03d20100e99`
