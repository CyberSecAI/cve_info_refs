Here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2022-20936:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

Based on the provided content, CVE-2022-20936 is indeed related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, specifically related to insufficient input validation within the web-based management interface. This aligns with the information found in the provided Cisco Security Advisory, and specifically "Cisco Firepower Management Center Software Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities"

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco FMC Software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected interface.
    *   The attacker might gain access to sensitive browser-based information.
    *   In some scenarios, the attacker can cause a temporary denial of service affecting parts of the FMC Dashboard.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attack via the web-based management interface.
    *   The attacker injects crafted, malicious input into various data fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FMC's management interface.
    *   No specific user role seems to be required

**3. Technical Details:**

* The content confirms that the vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of user-supplied input.
*   Attackers can insert malicious script code into data fields that are stored and displayed on the web interface of the FMC software, leading to the execution of code by other users when they access the affected parts of the interface.
* The advisory notes that a successful exploit of the vulnerabilities could result in the ability to run arbitrary script code within the userâ€™s browser, as well as access sensitive, browser-based information.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   The content includes references to the Cisco software checker and other related documents

**4. Additional Information:**

*   This specific vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in the "November 2022 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication".
*   The advisory is marked as "Final," meaning Cisco's investigation is complete, and no further updates are expected unless a major change to the vulnerability's nature occurs.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.

**5. Remediation:**
    * The provided content emphasizes the need to apply the appropriate software updates released by Cisco to address the listed vulnerabilities.

**6. Relevant content:**

```
Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.

These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted input into various data fields in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface, or access sensitive, browser-based information. In some cases, it is also possible to cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.
