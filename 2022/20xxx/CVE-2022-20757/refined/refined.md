Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-20757:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents explicitly mention "CVE-2022-20757" in connection with a denial of service vulnerability in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software. The information aligns with the official CVE description, which refers to a DoS vulnerability due to improper traffic handling.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability is **improper traffic handling** when platform limits are reached in the connection handling function of Cisco FTD software.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness lies in the FTD software's inability to properly manage a high volume of traffic, particularly UDP traffic, causing it to reach platform limits.
*   This improper traffic handling leads to resource exhaustion.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation results in a **denial of service (DoS) condition** on the affected device.
*   Specifically, the attacker can cause all new, incoming connections to be dropped, effectively rendering the device unable to establish new network connections.
*   This affects the availability of the device and any service it provides.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **remote** and **network based**. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a high rate of UDP traffic through an affected device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send a high rate of UDP traffic to the vulnerable FTD device, making it reachable over a network.
*   The attacker **does not require any authentication** or special privileges, making it an unauthenticated remote attack.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco devices configured to send traffic to Snort2 or Snort3 for further evaluation when a matching blocking rule is encountered.
*   There are no workarounds that fully address the vulnerability. However, a mitigation is to reduce the scope of the vulnerability by not sending traffic to Snort.
*   Cisco released software updates to fix the issue.
*   The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   The provided CVSS vector string is: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H` which confirms a high impact on availability.

In summary, CVE-2022-20757 describes a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by overwhelming a Cisco FTD device with UDP traffic, leading to the device dropping new connections.
