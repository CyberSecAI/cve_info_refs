Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20613:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-20613, which is related to a CSRF vulnerability in the Mailer Plugin for Jenkins. This aligns with the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Mailer Plugin's form validation method does not require POST requests. This lack of proper validation allows an attacker to trigger the method by crafting a malicious link or script.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is that the form validation method in the Mailer Plugin does not enforce POST request verification, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Missing Permission Check:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the method implementing the form validation not performing proper permission checks, which could allow unprivileged users to initiate DNS lookups.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could exploit the CSRF vulnerability to force a user's browser to make unauthorized requests to the Jenkins server.
- Combined with the lack of permission checks, attackers with Overall/Read access can use the Jenkins instance's DNS to resolve an attacker-specified hostname.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by tricking a user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage, triggering the DNS look up.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker requires Overall/Read access to a Jenkins instance.
-   The attacker also needs to trick a user's browser into making a request to the Jenkins server

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the form validation method of the Mailer Plugin.
- The affected Mailer Plugin versions are 391.ve4a_38c1b_cf4b and earlier.
- The fix is implemented in Mailer Plugin version 408.vd726a_1130320, which now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

**Summary**
CVE-2022-20613 details a CSRF vulnerability in the Mailer Plugin of Jenkins, which can allow attackers to perform unauthorized DNS lookups on a Jenkins server using a victim's browser. This vulnerability is compounded by a lack of permission checks on a specific method in the plugin.
