**CVE-2022-20022**

*   **Title:** Expected behavior violation in Bluetooth
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Vulnerability Type:** DoS (Denial of Service)
*   **CWE:** CWE-440 Expected Behavior Violation
*   **Description:** In Bluetooth, there is a possible link disconnection due to bluetooth not properly handling a connection attempt from a host with the same BD address as the currently connected BT host. This could lead to remote denial of service of bluetooth with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
*   **Affected Chipsets:** MT6580, MT6630, MT6735, MT6737, MT6739, MT6750S, MT6753, MT6755S, MT6757, MT6757C, MT6757CD, MT6757CH, MT6763, MT6771, MT7662T, MT7663, MT7668, MT8163, MT8167, MT8167S, MT8173, MT8183, MT8321, MT8362A, MT8362B, MT8385, MT8765, MT8788
*   **Affected Software Versions:** Android 10.0, 11.0

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to a failure of the Bluetooth software to properly handle a connection attempt from a host that has the same Bluetooth Device (BD) address as the host that is currently connected. The Bluetooth software incorrectly handles this situation, leading to the disconnection of the existing link.

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of connection requests with duplicate BD addresses
*   **Weakness:**  Expected behavior violation in the Bluetooth connection management.
*   **Impact:** Remote denial of service of Bluetooth
*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploited remotely by attempting a Bluetooth connection from a host with the same BD address as the connected host.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range. No special execution privileges or user interaction is needed.
