- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the preloader (usb) component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege. An attacker with physical access to the device can gain elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the device is required. The vulnerability is triggered via the USB interface in the preloader.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device to exploit this vulnerability, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.
