Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20008:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises in the handling of MMC (MultiMediaCard) read operations during device recovery. When a read with `MMC_READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK` fails, the recovery handler falls back to using `MMC_READ_SINGLE_BLOCK` for each block, retrying up to `MMC_READ_SINGLE_RETRIES` times. The core issue lies in how the results of these retried reads are reported back to the block layer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect Success Reporting:** The logic was flawed and could report a read as successful even when no data was actually read from the device. This occurs when the command error with retries remaining was set to `BLK_STS_OK` (default), even if no data was read.
- **Error Masking:**  If an MMC command fails due to a CRC mismatch or card rejection (e.g. due to a CRC mismatch), the error might be masked, leading to the incorrect reporting of successful reads.
- **Lack of Retries on Specific Errors:** When the error code is `BLK_STS_IOERR`, the error is reported correctly, but no retries are attempted, potentially leading to a failure where a retry might have succeeded.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker cannot directly trigger this condition. However, this flaw can lead to data corruption or an inconsistent system state, specifically when the system attempts to read data from the MMC during recovery. The system can then incorrectly believe that data was read successfully when in fact it was not, potentially causing further failures later in the recovery process.

**Attack vectors:**

This is not a remotely exploitable vulnerability. It's a flaw in how the system handles errors during MMC read operations. The trigger for this issue would be a failure during an `MMC_READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK` command with subsequent fallbacks and error responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker would need to be in a position to cause MMC read errors, potentially by manipulating the card in a way that causes CRC mismatches or by causing other low-level hardware issues. However, this is not a direct attack vector, but rather a failure handling issue.
- The attacker would also require the device to be in recovery mode.
