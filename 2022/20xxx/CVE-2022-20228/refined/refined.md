Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to a race condition when memory mappings in the C2Allocator are performed. This suggests a multi-threaded or asynchronous memory allocation/management issue. The fix attempts to protect memory mappings from race conditions and cleans up the C2AllocatorIon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Race condition during memory mapping in C2Allocator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The CVE description states this could lead to information disclosure and the provided Android Security Bulletin indicates a "High" severity. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable program behavior which could include information leaks, crashes, or potentially more severe vulnerabilities if exploited in a specific way.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the media framework components of Android. The specific details of how to trigger the race condition are not detailed. It's possible an attacker would need to be able to utilize the media framework to some degree, whether directly or indirectly through a malformed media file/stream, for example.
- The vulnerability is present in Android versions 12 and 12L.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely require the ability to trigger operations within the media framework that lead to memory mapping via the C2Allocator. This might involve providing a specially crafted media file, or a specific sequence of operations that interacts with media processing.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is fixed in the 2022-07-01 security patch level.
- This vulnerability is also listed under "Google Play system updates," indicating that it affects Project Mainline components of Android, specifically Media Codecs and Media Framework components.
- The fix is available in AOSP.

The provided commit messages add slightly more information:
-   The first commit message clarifies that the fix "protects memory mappings of C2DmABufAllocator from race condition" and includes "Cleanup C2AllocatorIon also".
-   The second commit message does not appear to relate to CVE-2022-20228.
