Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-20790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The web-based management interface fails to adequately validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject directory traversal character sequences within HTTP requests. This can lead to the attacker accessing files and directories that they should not have access to.
- **CWE-23:** This vulnerability is classified as CWE-23, which refers to "Relative Path Traversal."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system of the affected device. This could expose sensitive information, such as configuration files, application code, or other data stored on the system.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** The primary impact is on the confidentiality of the system, with a high potential for data exposure. There's no impact on Integrity or Availability based on the advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests over the network.
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the system, exploiting it remotely via the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to authenticate to the web-based management interface of the affected system.
- **Knowledge of vulnerability:** Attacker needs to know how to craft a malicious HTTP request to exploit the path traversal vulnerability

**Additional Details**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco Unified CM and Unified CM SME.
- **CVSS Score:** Base score of 6.5 (Medium severity), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
- **Mitigation:** Upgrade to a fixed software version as there are no workarounds available.
- **Fixed Release:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 14SU1 for releases 14.0 of Cisco Unified CM and Cisco Unified CM SME.
- **No known exploitation in the wild** There are no known public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability as of the time of the advisory.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- Cisco PSIRT is responsible for investigating and disclosing vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services.
- Cisco Security Advisories provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action.
