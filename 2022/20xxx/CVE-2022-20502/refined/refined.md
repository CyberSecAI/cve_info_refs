    "CVE": "CVE-2022-20502",
    "description": "The vulnerability in this section could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.",
    "root_cause": "When a dex file is opened, the class linker saves the dex file address in dex_caches_. When GC occurs, the dex file is freed but the address remains in dex_caches_. Later, when code tries to iterate over dex_caches_, a use-after-free issue occurs.",

      "Use-after-free"
