    "ID": "CVE-2022-20960",
    "content": "The vulnerability is present in Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA). It is due to improper handling of certain TLS connections. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by establishing a large number of concurrent TLS connections to an affected device. This can cause the device to drop new TLS email messages from associated email servers, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The device will recover autonomously within a few hours of when the attack is halted or mitigated.\n\nAttack Vector: Network\nRequired attacker capabilities: Unauthenticated remote attacker\nImpact of exploitation: Denial of Service (DoS); the device drops new TLS email messages.\nWeaknesses: Improper handling of TLS connections. The device can be overwhelmed by a large number of concurrent TLS connections.",
