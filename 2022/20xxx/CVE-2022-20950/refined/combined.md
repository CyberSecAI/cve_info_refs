## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Upgrade Feature History

Table 6. Version 7.0.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Improved FTD upgrade performance and status reporting. | FTD upgrades are now easier faster, more reliable, and take up less disk space. A new Upgrades tab in the Message Center provides further enhancements to upgrade status and error reporting. |
| Easy-to-follow upgrade workflow for FTD devices. | A new device upgrade page (Devices > Device Upgrade) on the FMC provides an easy-to-follow wizard for upgrading Version 6.4+ FTD devices. It walks you through important pre-upgrade stages, including selecting devices to upgrade, copying the upgrade package to the devices, and compatibility and readiness checks.  To begin, use the new Upgrade Firepower Software action on the Device Management page (Devices > Device Management > Select Action).  As you proceed, the system displays basic information about your selected devices, as well as the current upgrade-related status. This includes any reasons why you cannot upgrade. If a device does not "pass" a stage in the wizard, it does not appear in the next stage.  If you navigate away from wizard, your progress is preserved, although other users with Administrator access can reset, modify, or continue the wizard.   | **Note** | You must still use System(system gear icon) > Updates to upload or specify the location of FTD upgrade packages. You must also use the System Updates page to upgrade the FMC itself, as well as all non-FTD managed devices. | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | In Version 7.0, the wizard does not correctly display devices in clusters or high availability pairs. Even though you must select and upgrade these devices as a unit, the wizard displays them as standalone devices. Device status and upgrade readiness are evaluated and reported on an individual basis. This means it is possible for one unit to appear to "pass" to the next stage while the other unit or units do not. However, these devices are still grouped. Running a readiness check on one, runs it on all. Starting the upgrade on one, starts it on all.  To avoid possible time-consuming upgrade failures, *manually* ensure all group members are ready to move on to the next step of the wizard before you click Next. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade more FTD devices at once. | The number of devices you can upgrade at once is now limited by your management network bandwidth—not the system's ability to manage simultaneous upgrades. Previously, we recommended against upgrading more than five devices at a time.   | **Important** | Only upgrades to FTD Version 6.7+ using the FTD upgrade wizard see this improvement. If you are upgrading devices to an older FTD release—even if you are using the new upgrade wizard—we still recommend you limit to five devices at a time. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade different device models together. | You can now use the FTD upgrade wizard to queue and invoke upgrades for all FTD models at the same time, as long as the system has access to the appropriate upgrade packages.  Previously, you would choose an upgrade package, then choose the devices to upgrade using that package. That meant that you could upgrade multiple devices at the same time *only* if they shared an upgrade package. For example, you could upgrade two Firepower 2100 series devices at the same time, but not a Firepower 2100 series and a Firepower 1000 series. |

Table 7. Version 6.7.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades remove PCAP files to save disk space. | Upgrades now remove locally stored PCAP files. To upgrade, you must have enough free disk space or the upgrade fails. |
| Improved FTD upgrade status reporting and cancel/retry options. | You can now view the status of FTD device upgrades and readiness checks in progress on the Device Management page, as well as a 7-day history of upgrade success/failures. The Message Center also provides enhanced status and error messages.  A new Upgrade Status pop-up, accessible from both Device Management and the Message Center with a single click, shows detailed upgrade information, including percentage/time remaining, specific upgrade stage, success/failure data, upgrade logs, and so on.  Also on this pop-up, you can manually cancel failed or in-progress upgrades (Cancel Upgrade), or retry failed upgrades (Retry Upgrade). Canceling an upgrade reverts the device to its pre-upgrade state.   | **Note** | To be able to manually cancel or retry a failed upgrade, you must disable the new auto-cancel option, which appears when you use the FMC to upgrade an FTD device: Automatically cancel on upgrade failure and roll back to the previous version. With the option enabled, the device automatically reverts to its pre-upgrade state upon upgrade failure.  Auto-cancel is not supported for patches. In an HA or clustered deployment, auto-cancel applies to each device individually. That is, if the upgrade fails on one device, only that device is reverted. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens:   * System(system gear icon) > Updates > Product Updates > Available Updates > Install icon for the FTD upgrade package * Devices > Device Management > Upgrade * Message Center > Tasks   New/modified CLI commands: show upgrade status detail , show upgrade status continuous , show upgrade status , upgrade cancel , upgrade retry |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Custom intrusion rule import warns when rules collide. | The FMC now warns you of rule collisions when you import custom (local) intrusion rules. Previously, the system would silently skip the rules that cause collisions—with the exception of Version 6.6.0.1, where a rule import with collisions would fail entirely.  On the Rule Updates page, if a rule import had collisions, a warning icon is displayed in the Status column. For more information, hover your pointer over the warning icon and read the tooltip.  Note that a collision occurs when you try to import an intrusion rule that has the same SID/revision number as an existing rule. You should always make sure that updated versions of custom rules have new revision numbers.  New/modified screens: We added a warning icon to System(system gear icon) > Updates > Rule Updates. |

Table 8. Version 6.6.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Get FTD upgrade packages from an internal web server. | FTD devices can now get upgrade packages from your own internal web server, rather than from the FMC. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth between the FMC and its devices. It also saves space on the FMC.   | **Note** | This feature is supported only for FTD devices running Version 6.6+. It is not supported for upgrades *to* Version 6.6, nor is it supported for the FMC or Classic devices. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens: We added a Specify software update source option to the page where you upload upgrade packages. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic VDB update during initial setup. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically attempts to update the vulnerability database (VDB).  This is a one-time operation. If the FMC has internet access, we recommend you schedule tasks to perform automatic recurring VDB update downloads and installations. |

Table 9. Version 6.5.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic software downloads and GeoDB updates. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically schedules:   * A weekly task to download software updates for the FMC   and its managed devices. * Weekly updates for the GeoDB.   The tasks are scheduled in UTC, which means that when they occur locally depends on the date and your specific location. Also, because tasks are scheduled in UTC, they do not adjust for Daylight Saving Time, summer time, or any such seasonal adjustments that you may observe in your location. If you are affected, scheduled tasks occur one hour “later” in the summer than in the winter, according to local time. We recommend you review the auto-scheduled configurations and adjust them if necessary. |

Table 10. Version 6.4.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Management Center Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades postpone scheduled tasks. | The FMC upgrade process now postpones scheduled tasks. Any task scheduled to begin during the upgrade will begin five minutes after the post-upgrade reboot.   | **Note** | Before you begin any upgrade, you must still make sure running tasks are complete. Tasks running when the upgrade begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed. | | --- | --- |   Note that this feature is supported for all upgrades *from* a supported version. This includes Version 6.4.0.10 and later patches, Version 6.6.3 and later maintenance releases, and Version 6.7.0+. This feature is not supported for upgrades *to* a supported version from an unsupported version. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Signed SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates. | So the system can verify that you are using the correct update files, Version 6.4+ uses *signed* updates for intrusion rules (SRU), the vulnerability database (VDB), and the geolocation database (GeoDB). Earlier versions continue to use unsigned updates.  Unless you manually download updates from the Cisco Support & Download site—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—you should not notice any difference in functionality. If, however, you do manually download and install SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates, make sure you download the correct package for your current version.  Signed update files begin with 'Cisco' instead of 'Sourcefire,' and terminate in .sh.REL.tar instead of .sh, as follows:   * SRU:   Cisco\_Firepower\_SRU-*date*-*build*-vrt.sh.REL.tar * VDB:   Cisco\_VDB\_Fingerprint\_Database-4.5.0-*version*.sh.REL.tar * GeoDB:   Cisco\_GEODB\_Update-*date*-*build*.sh.REL.tar   We will provide both signed and unsigned updates until the end-of-support for versions that require unsigned updates. Do not untar signed (.tar) packages. If you accidentally upload a signed update to an older FMC or ASA FirePOWER device, you must manually delete it. Leaving the package takes up disk space, and also may cause issues with future upgrades. |

Table 11. Version 6.2.3 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Device Upgrade** | |
| Copy upgrade packages to managed devices before the upgrade. | You can now copy (or push) an upgrade package from the FMC to a managed device before you run the actual upgrade. This is useful because you can push during times of low bandwidth use, outside of the upgrade maintenance window.  When you push to high availability, clustered, or stacked devices, the system sends the upgrade package to the active/control/primary first, then to the standby/data/secondary.  New/modified screens: System(system gear icon) > Updates |
| **Content Updates** | |
| FMC warns of Snort restart before VDB updates. | The FMC now warns you that Vulnerability Database (VDB) updates restart the Snort process. This interrupts traffic inspection and, depending on how the managed device handles traffic, possibly interrupts traffic flow. You can cancel the install until a more convenient time, such as during a maintenance window.  These warnings can appear:   * After you download and manually install a VDB. * When you create a scheduled task to install the VDB. * When the VDB installs in the background, such as during a   previously scheduled task or as part of a software   upgrade. |
| Deprecated: Geolocation details | In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package mapping IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package containing additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. In January 2024, we stopped providing the IP package. This saves disk space and does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way. Any contextual data is now stale, and upgrading to most later versions deletes the IP package. Options to view contextual data have no effect, and are removed in later versions. |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SIP and Snort 3 Detection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-ftdsnort3sip-dos-A4cHeArC  First Published: 2022 November 9 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwb99509](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb99509)     CVE-2022-20950     CWE-770       CVSS Score: [Base 5.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2022-20950     CWE-770       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftdsnort3sip-dos-A4cHeArC/csaf/cisco-sa-ftdsnort3sip-dos-A4cHeArC.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the interaction of SIP and Snort 3 for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 detection engine to restart.  This vulnerability is due to a lack of error-checking when SIP bidirectional flows are being inspected by Snort 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted SIP traffic through an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a restart of the Snort 3 process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftdsnort3sip-dos-A4cHeArC>  This advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: November 2022 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74838).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco FTD Software if it was running Release 7.2.0 or 7.2.0.1 and had the Snort 3 detection engine configured with an SIP inspection policy.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration On new installations of Cisco FTD Software releases 7.0.0 and later, Snort 3 is running by default. On devices that were running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0 or earlier and were upgraded to Release 7.0.0 or later, Snort 2 is running by default. Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration Using the FTD Software CLI To determine whether Snort 3 is configured on a device that is running Cisco FTD Software, log in to the Cisco FTD Software CLI and use the **show snort3 status** command. If the command produces the following output, the device is running Snort 3 and is affected by this vulnerability:  ```   show snort3 statusCurrently running Snort 3   ``` Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration for Cisco Firepower Management Center Software-Managed Devices To determine whether Snort 3 is configured on a device that is managed by Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, complete the following steps:    1. Log in to the Cisco FMC Software web interface.   2. From the **Devices** menu, choose **Device Management**.   3. Choose the appropriate Cisco FTD device.   4. Click the **Edit** pencil icon.   5. Choose the **Device** tab and look in the **Inspection Engine** area.   + If **Snort 2** is listed, the device is not affected by this vulnerability.   + If **Snort 3** is listed, the device is affected by this vulnerability.Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration for Cisco Firepower Device Manager Software-Managed Devices To determine whether Snort 3 is configured on a device that is managed by Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software, complete the following steps:    1. Log in to the Cisco FTD Software web interface.   2. From the main menu, choose **Policies**.   3. Choose the **Intrusion** tab.   4. Look for the **Inspection Engine** version. The version will start with either a *2* for Snort 2 or a *3* for Snort 3.   + If the device is running a Snort 2 version, it is not affected by this vulnerability.   + If the device is running a Snort 3 version, it is affected by this vulnerability.Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration for Cisco Defense Orchestrator-Managed Devices To determine whether Snort 3 is configured on a device that is managed by Cisco Defense Orchestrator, complete the following steps:    1. Log in to the Cisco Defense Orchestrator web interface.   2. From the **Inventory** menu, choose the appropriate Cisco FTD device.   3. In the **Device Details** area, look for **Snort Version**. The version will start with either a *2* for Snort 2 or a *3* for Snort 3.   + If the device is running a Snort 2 version, it is not affected by this vulnerability.   + If the device is running a Snort 3 version, it is affected by this vulnerability.Determine Cisco FTD Software SIP Configuration To determine whether SIP inspection is configured on Cisco FTD Software, run the **show service-policy | include sip** command in the CLI. The device is considered vulnerable if Snort 3 is configured as described above and if the output includes **Inspect: sip**, as shown in the following example:  ```   device# show service-policy | include sipInspect: sip , packet 2, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0, 5-min-pkt-rate 0 pkts/sec, v6-fail-close 0 sctp-drop-override 0    ```  **Note:** SIP inspection is enabled by default on Cisco FTD Software. For detailed information about the default settings for application inspection policies, see the [Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/firewall/asa-99-firewall-config/inspect-service-policy.html#ID-2094-0000026e).

"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the interaction of SIP and Snort 3 for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 detection engine to restart.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of error-checking when SIP bidirectional flows are being inspected by Snort 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted SIP traffic through an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a restart of the Snort 3 process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: November 2022 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74838\"]."

"text": "At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco FTD Software if it was running Release 7.2.0 or 7.2.0.1 and had the Snort 3 detection engine configured with an SIP inspection policy.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration\r\nOn new installations of Cisco FTD Software releases 7.0.0 and later, Snort 3 is running by default. On devices that were running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0 or earlier and were upgraded to Release 7.0.0 or later, Snort 2 is running by default.\r\n Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration Using the FTD Software CLI\r\nTo determine whether Snort 3 is configured on a device that is running Cisco FTD Software, log in to the Cisco FTD Software CLI and use the show snort3 status command. If the command produces the following output, the device is running Snort 3 and is affected by this vulnerability:\r\n\r\n\r\nshow snort3 status\r\nCurrently running Snort 3\r\n Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration for Cisco Firepower Management Center Software-Managed Devices\r\nTo determine whether Snort 3 is configured on a device that is managed by Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, complete the following steps:\r\n\r\nLog in to the Cisco FMC Software web interface.\r\nFrom the Devices menu, choose Device Management.\r\nChoose the appropriate Cisco FTD device.\r\nClick the Edit pencil icon.\r\nChoose the Device tab and look in the Inspection Engine area.\r\nIf Snort 2 is listed, the device is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\nIf Snort 3 is listed, the device is affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration for Cisco Firepower Device Manager Software-Managed Devices\r\nTo determine whether Snort 3 is configured on a device that is managed by Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software, complete the following steps:\r\n\r\nLog in to the Cisco FTD Software web interface.\r\nFrom the main menu, choose Policies.\r\nChoose the Intrusion tab.\r\nLook for the Inspection Engine version. The version will start with either a 2 for Snort 2 or a 3 for Snort 3.\r\nIf the device is running a Snort 2 version, it is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\nIf the device is running a Snort 3 version, it is affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n Determine Cisco FTD Software Configuration for Cisco Defense Orchestrator-Managed Devices\r\nTo determine whether Snort 3 is configured on a device that is managed by Cisco Defense Orchestrator, complete the following steps:\r\n\r\nLog in to the Cisco Defense Orchestrator web interface.\r\nFrom the Inventory menu, choose the appropriate Cisco FTD device.\r\nIn the Device Details area, look for Snort Version. The version will start with either a 2 for Snort 2 or a 3 for Snort 3.\r\nIf the device is running a Snort 2 version, it is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\nIf the device is running a Snort 3 version, it is affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n Determine Cisco FTD Software SIP Configuration\r\nTo determine whether SIP inspection is configured on Cisco FTD Software, run the show service-policy | include sip command in the CLI. The device is considered vulnerable if Snort 3 is configured as described above and if the output includes Inspect: sip, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\ndevice# show service-policy | include sip\r\nInspect: sip , packet 2, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0, 5-min-pkt-rate 0 pkts/sec, v6-fail-close 0 sctp-drop-override 0\r\n\r\nNote: SIP inspection is enabled by default on Cisco FTD Software. For detailed information about the default settings for application inspection policies, see the Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/firewall/asa-99-firewall-config/inspect-service-policy.html#ID-2094-0000026e\"]."

# Service Policy

Service policies
using Modular Policy
Framework provide a consistent and flexible way to configure ASA features.
For example, you can use a service policy to create a timeout configuration
that is specific to a particular TCP application, as opposed to one that
applies to all TCP applications. A service policy consists of multiple actions
or rules applied to an interface or applied globally.

### The Components of a Service Policy

The point of service policies is to apply advanced
services to the traffic you are allowing. Any traffic permitted by access rules
can have service policies applied, and thus receive special processing, such as
being redirected to a service module or having application inspection applied.

You can have these types of service policy:

* One global policy that gets applied to all
  interfaces.
* One service policy applied per interface. The
  policy can be a mix of classes for traffic going through the device and
  management traffic directed at the ASA interface rather than going through it,

Each service policy is composed of the following
elements:

1. Service policy map, which is the ordered set
   of rules, and is named on the
   service-policy command.
   In ASDM, the policy map is represented as a folder on the Service Policy Rules
   page.
2. Rules, each rule being a
   class command within the
   service policy map and the commands associated with the
   class command. In ASDM,
   each rule is shown on a separate row, and the name of the rule is the class
   name.

   The
   **class** command defines the traffic
   matching criteria for the rule.

   The commands associated with class, such as
   **inspect**,
   **set connection timeout**, and so forth,
   define the services and constraints to apply to matching traffic. Note that
   inspect commands can point to inspection policy maps, which define actions to
   apply to inspected traffic. Keep in mind that inspection policy maps are not
   the same as service policy maps.

The following example compares how service
policies appear in the CLI with how they appear in ASDM. Note that there is not
a one-to-one mapping between the figure call-outs and lines in the CLI.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/300001-400000/370001-380000/373001-374000/373059.tif/_jcr_content/renditions/373059.jpg)

The following CLI is generated by the rules shown
in the figure above.

```

### Features Configured with Service Policies

The following table lists the features you configure using
service policies.

Table 1. Features Configured with Service Policies

| Feature | For Through Traffic? | For Management Traffic? | See: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application inspection (multiple types) | **All** except RADIUS accounting | **RADIUS accounting** only | * [Getting Started with Application Layer Protocol Inspection](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-00000004). * [Inspection of Basic Internet Protocols](inspect-basic.html#ID-2092-00000004). * [Inspection for Voice and Video Protocols](inspect-voicevideo.html#ID-2096-00000004). * [Inspection for Mobile Networks](inspect-mobile.html#ID-2095-00000004). |
| ASA FirePOWER (ASA SFR) | **Yes** | No | [ASA FirePOWER Module](access-sfr.html#ID-2123-00000004). |
| NetFlow Secure Event Logging filtering | **Yes** | **Yes** | See the NetFlow implementation guide. |
| QoS input and output policing | **Yes** | No | [Quality of Service](conns-qos.html#ID-2133-00000004). |
| QoS standard priority queue | **Yes** | No | [Quality of Service](conns-qos.html#ID-2133-00000004). |
| TCP and UDP connection limits and timeouts, and TCP sequence number randomization | **Yes** | **Yes** | [Connection Settings](conns-connlimits.html#ID-2068-00000004). |
| TCP normalization | **Yes** | No | [Connection Settings](conns-connlimits.html#ID-2068-00000004). |
| TCP state bypass | **Yes** | No | [Connection Settings](conns-connlimits.html#ID-2068-00000004). |
| User statistics for Identity Firewall | **Yes** | **Yes** | See the **user-statistics** command in the command reference. |

### Feature Directionality

Actions are applied to traffic bidirectionally or
unidirectionally depending on the feature. For features that are applied
bidirectionally, all traffic that enters or exits the interface to which you
apply the policy map is affected if the traffic matches the class map for both
directions.

| **Note** | ---   When you use a global policy, all features are unidirectional; features that are normally bidirectional when applied to a single interface only apply to the ingress of each interface when applied globally. Because the policy is applied to all interfaces, the policy will be applied in both directions so bidirectionality in this case is redundant.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For features that are applied unidirectionally,
for example QoS priority queue, only traffic that enters (or exits, depending
on the feature) the interface to which you apply the policy map is affected.
See the following table for the directionality of each feature.

Table 2. Feature Directionality

| Feature | Single Interface Direction | Global Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application inspection (multiple types) | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| ASA FirePOWER (ASA SFR) | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| NetFlow Secure Event Logging filtering | N/A | Ingress |
| QoS input policing | Ingress | Ingress |
| QoS output policing | Egress | Egress |
| QoS standard priority queue | Egress | Egress |
| TCP and UDP connection limits and timeouts, and TCP sequence number randomization | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| TCP normalization | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| TCP state bypass | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| User statistics for Identity Firewall | Bidirectional | Ingress |

### Feature Matching Within a Service Policy

A packet matches class maps in a policy map for a given
interface according to the following rules:

1. A packet can match only one class
   map in the policy map
   for each feature type.
2. When the packet matches a class map for a feature
   type, the ASA does not attempt to match it to any subsequent class
   maps for that feature
   type.
3. If the packet matches a subsequent class
   map for a different
   feature type, however, then the ASA also applies the actions for the
   subsequent class map, if supported. See
   [Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions](#ID-2094-000001f7)
   for more information about unsupported combinations.

   | **Note** | ---   Application inspection includes multiple inspection types, and most are mutually exclusive. For inspections that can be combined, each inspection is considered to be a separate feature.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

#### Examples of Packet Matching

For example:

* If a packet matches a class map for connection
  limits, and also matches a class map for an application
  inspection, then both actions are applied.
* If a packet matches a class map for HTTP
  inspection, but also matches another class map that includes HTTP
  inspection, then the second class map actions are not
  applied.
* If a packet matches a class map for HTTP
  inspection, but also matches another class map that includes FTP
  inspection, then the second class map actions are not
  applied because HTTP and FTP inspections cannot be combined.
* If a packet matches a class map for HTTP
  inspection, but also matches another class map that includes IPv6
  inspection, then both actions are applied because the IPv6 inspection can be
  combined with any other type of inspection.

### Order in Which Multiple Feature Actions are Applied

The order in which different types of actions in a policy map are
performed is independent of the order in which the actions appear in the policy map.

Actions are performed in the following order:

1. QoS input policing
2. TCP normalization, TCP and UDP connection limits and timeouts,
   TCP sequence number randomization, and TCP state bypass.

   | **Note** | ---   When a the ASA performs a proxy service (such as AAA) or it modifies the TCP payload (such as FTP inspection), the TCP normalizer acts in dual mode, where it is applied before and after the proxy or payload modifying service.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
3. Application inspections that can be combined with other
   inspections:

   1. IPv6
   2. IP options
   3. WAAS
4. Application inspections that cannot be combined with other
   inspections. See
   [Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions](#ID-2094-000001f7)
   for more information.
5. ASA FirePOWER (ASA SFR)
6. QoS output policing
7. QoS standard priority queue

| **Note** | ---   NetFlow Secure Event Logging filtering and User statistics for Identity Firewall are order-independent.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions

Some features are not compatible with each other for the same
traffic. The following list might not include all incompatibilities; for
information about compatibility of each feature, see the chapter or section for
the feature:

* You cannot configure QoS priority queuing and QoS policing for
  the same set of traffic.
* Most inspections should not be combined with another inspection, so the
  ASA only applies one inspection if you configure multiple inspections for the
  same traffic.
  Exceptions
  are listed in [Order in Which Multiple Feature Actions are Applied](#ID-2094-000001cf).
* You cannot configure traffic to be sent to multiple
  modules.
* HTTP inspection is not compatible with ASA FirePOWER.

| **Note** | ---   The **match default-inspection-traffic** command, which is used in the default global policy, is a special CLI shortcut to match the default ports for all inspections. When used in a policy map, this class map ensures that the correct inspection is applied to each packet, based on the destination port of the traffic. For example, when UDP traffic for port 69 reaches the ASA, then the ASA applies the TFTP inspection; when TCP traffic for port 21 arrives, then the ASA applies the FTP inspection. So in this case only, you can configure multiple inspections for the same class map. Normally, the ASA does not use the port number to determine which inspection to apply, thus giving you the flexibility to apply inspections to non-standard ports, for example.   --- |
| --- | --- |

An example of a misconfiguration is if you configure multiple
inspections in the same policy map and do not use the
default-inspection-traffic shortcut. In the first example, traffic destined to
port 21 is mistakenly configured for both FTP and HTTP inspection. In the
second example, traffic destined to port 80 is mistakenly configured for both
FTP and HTTP inspection. In both cases of misconfiguration examples, only the
FTP inspection is applied, because FTP comes before HTTP in the order of
inspections applied.

#### Example 1: Misconfiguration for FTP packets: HTTP Inspection Also Configured

```

class-map ftp
   match port tcp eq 21
class-map http
   match port tcp eq 21 [it should be 80]
policy-map test
   class ftp
     inspect ftp
   class http
     inspect http

```

#### Example 2: Misconfiguration for HTTP packets: FTP Inspection Also Configured

```

class-map ftp
   match port tcp eq 80 [it should be 21]
class-map http
   match port tcp eq 80
policy-map test
   class ftp
     inspect ftp
   class http
     inspect http

```

### Feature Matching for Multiple Service Policies

For TCP and UDP traffic (and ICMP when you enable stateful ICMP inspection), service policies operate on traffic flows, and
not just individual packets. If traffic is part of an existing connection that matches a feature in a policy on one interface,
that traffic flow cannot also match the same feature in a policy on another interface; only the first policy is used.

For example, if HTTP traffic matches a policy on the inside interface to inspect HTTP traffic, and you have a separate policy
on the outside interface for HTTP inspection, then that traffic is not also inspected on the egress of the outside interface.
Similarly, the return traffic for that connection will not be inspected by the ingress policy of the outside interface, nor
by the egress policy of the inside interface.

For traffic that is not treated as a flow, for example ICMP when you do not
enable stateful ICMP inspection, returning traffic can match a different policy map on
the returning interface.

## Guidelines for Service Policies

### Inspection Guidelines

There is a separate topic that provides detailed guidelines for
application inspection service policies. See
[Guidelines for Application Inspection](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-000000ce).

### IPv6 Guidelines

Supports IPv6 for the following features:

* Application inspection for several, but not all, protocols. For
  details, see
  [Guidelines for Application Inspection](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-000000ce).
* ASA FirePOWER
* NetFlow Secure Event Logging filtering
* SCTP state bypass
* TCP and UDP connection limits and timeouts, TCP sequence number
  randomization
* TCP normalization
* TCP state bypass
* User statistics for Identity Firewall

### Class Map (Traffic Class) Guidelines

The maximum number of class maps (traffic classes) of all types
is 255 in single mode or per context in multiple mode. Class maps include the
following types:

* Layer 3/4 class maps (for through traffic and management
  traffic).
* Inspection class maps
* Regular expression class maps
* match  commands used directly underneath an
  inspection policy map

This limit also includes default class maps of all types,
limiting user-configured class maps to approximately 235.

### Policy Map Guidelines

See the following guidelines for using policy maps:

* You can only assign one policy map per interface. However you
  can create up to 64 policy maps in the configuration.
* You can apply the same policy map to multiple interfaces.
* You can identify up to 63 Layer 3/4 class maps in a Layer 3/4
  policy map.
* For each class map, you can assign multiple actions from one or
  more feature types, if supported. See
  [Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions](#ID-2094-000001f7).

### Service Policy Guidelines

* Interface service policies on ingress interfaces take precedence
  over the global service policy for a given feature. For example, if you have a
  global policy with FTP inspection, and an interface policy with TCP
  normalization, then both FTP inspection and TCP normalization are applied to
  the interface. However, if you have a global policy with FTP inspection, and an
  ingress interface policy with FTP inspection, then only the ingress interface
  policy FTP inspection is applied to that interface. If no ingress or global
  policy implements a feature, then an interface service policy on the egress
  interface that specifies the feature is applied.
* You can only apply one global policy. For example, you cannot
  create a global policy that includes feature set 1, and a separate global
  policy that includes feature set 2. All features must be included in a single
  policy.
* When you make service policy changes to the configuration, all
  *new* connections use the new service policy. Existing
  connections continue to use the policy that was configured at the time of the
  connection establishment. Output for the
  **show** command will not include data about the old
  connections.

  For example, if you remove a QoS service policy from an
  interface, then add a modified version, then the
  show service-policy  command only displays QoS
  counters associated with new connections that match the new service policy;
  existing connections on the old policy no longer show in the command output.

  To ensure that all connections use the new policy, you need to
  disconnect the current connections so they can reconnect using the new policy.
  Use the
  clear conn  or
  clear local-host  commands.

## Defaults for Service Policies

The following topics describe the default settings
for service policies and the Modular Policy Framework.

* [Default Service Policy Configuration](#ID-2094-00000270)
* [Default Class Maps (Traffic Classes)](#ID-2094-000002b1)

### Default Service Policy Configuration

By default, the configuration includes a policy
that matches all default application inspection traffic and applies certain
inspections to the traffic on all interfaces (a global policy). Not all
inspections are enabled by default. You can only apply one global policy, so if
you want to alter the global policy, you need to either edit the default policy
or disable it and apply a new one. (An interface policy overrides the global
policy for a particular feature.)

The default policy includes the following
application inspections:

* DNS
* FTP
* H323 (H225)
* H323 (RAS)
* RSH
* RTSP
* ESMTP
* SQLnet
* Skinny (SCCP)
* SunRPC
* SIP
* NetBios
* TFTP
* IP Options

The default policy configuration
includes the following commands:

```

class-map inspection_default
 match default-inspection-traffic
policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map
 parameters
message-length maximum client auto
message-length maximum 512
dns-guard
protocol-enforcement
nat-rewrite
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect dns preset_dns_map
  inspect ftp
  inspect h323 h225 _default_h323_map
  inspect h323 ras _default_h323_map
  inspect ip-options _default_ip_options_map
  inspect netbios
  inspect rsh
  inspect rtsp
  inspect skinny
  inspect esmtp _default_esmtp_map
  inspect sqlnet
  inspect sunrpc
  inspect tftp
  inspect sip
  service-policy global_policy global

```

### Default Class Maps (Traffic Classes)

The configuration includes a default Layer 3/4
class map (traffic class) that the ASA uses in the default global policy
called
default-inspection-traffic; it matches the default inspection traffic. This class,
which is used in the default global policy, is a special shortcut to match the
default ports for all inspections.

When used in a policy, this class ensures that the
correct inspection is applied to each packet, based on the destination port of
the traffic. For example, when UDP traffic for port 69 reaches the ASA, then
the ASA applies the TFTP inspection; when TCP traffic for port 21 arrives, then
the ASA applies the FTP inspection. So in this case only, you can configure
multiple inspections for the same class map. Normally, the ASA does not use the
port number to determine which inspection to apply, thus giving you the
flexibility to apply inspections to non-standard ports, for example.

```

class-map inspection_default
 match default-inspection-traffic

```

Another class map that exists in the default
configuration is called class-default, and it matches all traffic.
This class map appears at the end of all Layer 3/4
policy maps and essentially tells the ASA to not perform any actions on all
other traffic.
You can use the class-default class if desired, rather than making your own
**match any** class map. In fact,
some features are only available for class-default.

```

class-map class-default
 match any

```

## Configure Service Policies

To configure service policies using the Modular Policy
Framework, perform the following steps:

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Identify the traffic on which you want to act by creating Layer 3/4 class maps, as described in [Identify Traffic (Layer 3/4 Class Maps)](#ID-2094-000002ec).  For example, you might want to perform actions on all traffic that passes through the ASA; or you might only want to perform certain actions on traffic from 10.1.1.0/24 to any destination address. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Optionally, perform additional actions on some inspection traffic.  If one of the actions you want to perform is application inspection, and you want to perform additional actions on some inspection traffic, then create an inspection policy map. The inspection policy map identifies the traffic and specifies what to do with it.  For example, you might want to drop all HTTP requests with a body length greater than 1000 bytes.  You can create a self-contained inspection policy map that identifies the traffic directly with **match** commands, or you can create an inspection class map for reuse or for more complicated matching. For example, you could match text within a inspected packets using a regular expression or a group of regular expressions (a regular expression class map), and target actions based on narrower criteria. For example, you might want to drop all HTTP requests with a URL including the text “example.com.”  See [Configure Application Layer Protocol Inspection](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-000002d8). |
| **Step 3** | Define the actions you want to perform on each Layer 3/4 class map by creating a Layer 3/4 policy map, as described in [Define Actions (Layer 3/4 Policy Map)](#ID-2094-000003d0). |
| **Step 4** | Determine on which interfaces you want to apply the policy map, or apply it globally, as described in [Apply Actions to an Interface (Service Policy)](#ID-2094-00000475). |

* [Apply Actions to an Interface (Service Policy)](#ID-2094-00000475)

### Identify Traffic (Layer 3/4 Class Maps)

A Layer 3/4 class map identifies Layer 3 and 4 traffic to which you want to apply actions. You can create multiple Layer 3/4
class maps for each Layer 3/4 policy map.

* [Create a Layer 3/4 Class Map for Through Traffic](#ID-2094-000002ee)
* [Create a Layer 3/4 Class Map for Management Traffic](#ID-2094-0000039c)

#### Create a Layer 3/4 Class Map for Through Traffic

A Layer 3/4 class map matches traffic based on protocols, ports,
IP addresses and other Layer 3 or 4 attributes.

| **Tip** | ---   We suggest that you only inspect traffic on ports on which you expect application traffic; if you inspect all traffic, for example using **match any**, the ASA performance can be impacted.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Create a Layer 3/4 class map: class-map class\_map\_name  Where *class\_map\_name* is a string up to 40 characters in length.  The name “class-default” is reserved. All types of class maps use the same name space, so you cannot reuse a name already used by another type of class map. The CLI enters class-map configuration mode.  Example: ```  hostname(config)# class-map all_udp   ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) Add a description to the class map.  **description** *string*  Example: ```  hostname(config-cmap)# description All UDP traffic   ``` |
| **Step 3** | Match traffic using one of the following commands. Unless otherwise specified, you can include only one match command in the class map.   * **match any**—Matches all traffic.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match any         ``` * **match**   **access-list**   *access\_list\_name*—Matches traffic specified by an extended   ACL.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list udp         ``` * match port {tcp |   udp |   sctp} {eq   port\_num |   range   port\_num   port\_num} —Matches destination ports,   either a single port or a contiguous range of ports, for the indicated   protocol. For applications that use multiple, non-contiguous ports, use the   **match access-list** command and define an ACE to match each   port.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match tcp eq 80         ``` * **match**   **default-inspection-traffic**—Matches default traffic for   inspection: the default TCP and UDP ports used by all applications that the ASA   can inspect.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match default-inspection-traffic         ```    This command, which is used in the default global policy, is a   special CLI shortcut that when used in a policy map, ensures that the correct   inspection is applied to each packet, based on the destination port of the   traffic. For example, when UDP traffic for port 69 reaches the ASA, then the   ASA applies the TFTP inspection; when TCP traffic for port 21 arrives, then the   ASA applies the FTP inspection. So in this case only, you can configure   multiple inspections for the same class map (with the exception of WAAS   inspection, which can be configured with other inspections. See   [Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions](#ID-2094-000001f7)   for more information about combining actions). Normally, the ASA does not use   the port number to determine the inspection applied, thus giving you the   flexibility to apply inspections to non-standard ports, for example.  See   [Default Inspections and NAT Limitations](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-000000fe)   for a list of default ports. Not all applications whose ports are included in   the   **match default-inspection-traffic** command are enabled by   default in the policy map.  You can specify a   **match access-list**command along with the   **match default-inspection-traffic** command to narrow the   matched traffic. Because the   **match default-inspection-traffic**command specifies the ports and protocols to match, any   ports and protocols in the ACL are ignored. * **match**   **dscp***value1* [*value2*] [...] [*value8*]—Matches the DSCP value in an IP header, up to eight   DSCP values.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match dscp af43 cs1 ef         ``` * **match precedence***value1* [*value2*] [*value3*] [*value4*]—Matches up to   four precedence values, represented by the TOS byte in the IP header, where the   precedence values can be 0 to 7.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match precedence 1 4         ``` * **match rtp***starting\_port range*—Matches RTP traffic, where the   *starting\_port* specifies an even-numbered UDP destination   port between 2000 and 65534. The   *range* specifies the number of additional UDP ports to match   above the   *starting\_port*, between 0 and 16383.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match rtp 4004 100         ``` * **match tunnel-group***name—*Matches VPN tunnel   group traffic to which you want to apply QoS.  You can also specify one other   **match** command to refine the traffic match. You can specify   any of the preceding commands, except for the   **match any**,   **match access-list**, or   **match default-inspection-traffic** commands. Or you can also   enter the   **match flow ip destination-address** command to match flows in   the tunnel group going to each IP address.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match tunnel-group group1   hostname(config-cmap)# match flow ip destination-address         ``` |

---

##### Examples

The following is an example for the
class-map
command:

```

hostname(config)# access-list udp permit udp any any
hostname(config)# access-list tcp permit tcp any any
hostname(config)# access-list host_foo permit ip any 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.255

hostname(config)# class-map all_udp
hostname(config-cmap)# description "This class-map matches all UDP traffic"
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list udp

hostname(config-cmap)# class-map all_tcp
hostname(config-cmap)# description "This class-map matches all TCP traffic"
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list tcp

hostname(config-cmap)# class-map all_http
hostname(config-cmap)# description "This class-map matches all HTTP traffic"
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq http

hostname(config-cmap)# class-map to_server
hostname(config-cmap)# description "This class-map matches all traffic to server 10.1.1.1"
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list host_foo

```

#### Create a Layer 3/4 Class Map for Management Traffic

For management traffic to the ASA, you might want to perform
actions specific to this kind of traffic. You can specify a management class
map that can match an ACL or TCP or UDP ports. The types of actions available
for a management class map in the policy map are specialized for management
traffic.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Create a management class map: class-map type management class\_map\_name  Where *class\_map\_name* is a string up to 40 characters in length.  The name “class-default” is reserved. All types of class maps use the same name space, so you cannot reuse a name already used by another type of class map. The CLI enters class-map configuration mode.  Example: ```  hostname(config)# class-map management all_udp   ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) Add a description to the class map.  **description** *string*  Example: ```  hostname(config-cmap)# description All UDP traffic   ``` |
| **Step 3** | Match traffic using one of the following commands.   * **match**   **access-list**   *access\_list\_name*—Matches traffic specified by an extended   ACL.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list udp         ``` * match port {tcp |   udp |   sctp} {eq   port\_num |   range   port\_num   port\_num} —Matches destination ports,   either a single port or a contiguous range of ports, for the indicated   protocol. For applications that use multiple, non-contiguous ports, use the   **match access-list** command and define an ACE to match each   port.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match tcp eq 80         ``` |

---

### Define Actions (Layer 3/4 Policy Map)

After you configure Layer 3/4 class maps to identify traffic,
use a Layer 3/4 policy map to associate actions to those classes.

| **Tip** | ---   The maximum number of policy maps is 64, but you can only apply one policy map per interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Add the policy map: policy-map policy\_map\_name  Where policy\_map\_name  is the name of the policy map, up to 40 characters in length. All types of policy maps use the same name space, so you cannot reuse a name already used by another type of policy map. The CLI enters policy-map configuration mode.  Example: ```  hostname(config)# policy-map global_policy   ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Specify a previously configured Layer 3/4 class map: class class\_map\_name  Where the class\_map\_name  is the name of the class map.  See [Identify Traffic (Layer 3/4 Class Maps)](#ID-2094-000002ec) to add a class map.  Example: ```  hostname(config-pmap)# class all_http   ``` |
| **Step 3** | Specify one or more actions for this class map.  See [Features Configured with Service Policies](#ID-2094-0000007b).   | **Note** | If there is no match default-inspection-traffic  command in a class map, then at most one **inspect** command is allowed to be configured under the class. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Repeat the process for each class map you want to include in this policy map. |

---

#### Examples

The following is an example of a
policy-map
command for a connection policy. It limits the number of connections allowed to
the web server 10.1.1.1:

```

hostname(config)# access-list http-server permit tcp any host 10.1.1.1
hostname(config)# class-map http-server
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list http-server

hostname(config)# policy-map global-policy
hostname(config-pmap)# description This policy map defines a policy concerning
connection to http server.
hostname(config-pmap)# class http-server
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 256

```

The following example shows how multi-match works in a policy
map:

```

hostname(config)# class-map inspection_default
hostname(config-cmap)# match default-inspection-traffic
hostname(config)# class-map http_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 80

hostname(config)# policy-map outside_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http http_map
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect sip
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection timeout idle 0:10:0

```

The following example shows how traffic matches the first
available class map, and will not match any subsequent class maps that specify
actions in the same feature domain:

```

hostname(config)# class-map telnet_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 23
hostname(config)# class-map ftp_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 21
hostname(config)# class-map tcp_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp range 1 65535
hostname(config)# class-map udp_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port udp range 0 65535
hostname(config)# policy-map global_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class telnet_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection timeout idle 0:0:0
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 100
hostname(config-pmap)# class ftp_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection timeout idle 0:5:0
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 50
hostname(config-pmap)# class tcp_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection timeout idle 2:0:0
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 2000

```

When a Telnet connection is initiated, it matches
**class telnet\_traffic**. Similarly, if an FTP connection is
initiated, it matches
**class ftp\_traffic**. For any TCP connection other than Telnet
and FTP, it will match
**class tcp\_traffic**. Even though a Telnet or FTP connection
can match
**class tcp\_traffic**, the ASA does not make this match because
they previously matched other classes.

### Apply Actions to an Interface (Service Policy)

To activate the Layer 3/4 policy map, create a
service policy that applies it to one or more interfaces or that applies it
globally to all interfaces. Use the following command:

service-policy
policy\_map\_name {global |
interface
interface\_name} [fail-close]

Where:

* *policy\_map\_name*
  is the name of the policy map.
* **global** creates a
  service policy that applies to all interfaces that do not have a specific
  policy.

  You can only apply one global policy, so if
  you want to alter the global policy, you need to either edit the default policy
  or disable it and apply a new one. By default, the configuration includes a
  global policy that matches all default application inspection traffic and
  applies inspection to the traffic globally. The default service policy includes
  the following command:
  **service-policy global\_policy global**.
* **interface**
  *interface\_name* creates a service policy
  by associating a policy map with an interface.
* **fail-close**
  generates a syslog (767001) for IPv6 traffic that is dropped by application
  inspections that do not support IPv6 traffic. By default, syslogs are not
  generated.

#### Examples

For example, the following command enables the
inbound\_policy policy map on the outside interface:

```

hostname(config)# service-policy inbound_policy interface outside

```

The following commands disable the default
global policy, and enables a new one called new\_global\_policy.

```

hostname(config)# no service-policy global_policy global
hostname(config)# service-policy new_global_policy global

```

## Monitoring Service Policies

To monitor service policies, enter the following command:

* **show service-policy**

  Displays the service policy statistics.

## Examples for Service Policies (Modular Policy Framework)

This section includes several Modular Policy Framework examples.

* [Applying Inspection and QoS Policing to HTTP Traffic](#ID-2094-00000597)
* [Applying Inspection to HTTP Traffic Globally](#ID-2094-000005ba)
* [Applying Inspection and Connection Limits to HTTP Traffic to Specific Servers](#ID-2094-000005d7)
* [Applying Inspection to HTTP Traffic with NAT](#ID-2094-00000625)

### Applying Inspection and QoS Policing to HTTP Traffic

In this example, any HTTP connection (TCP traffic
on port 80) that enters or exits the ASA through the outside interface is
classified for HTTP inspection. Any HTTP traffic that exits the outside
interface is classified for policing.

Figure 1. HTTP Inspection and QoS Policing

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/140001-150000/143001-144000/143356.ps/_jcr_content/renditions/143356.jpg)

See the following commands for this example:

```

hostname(config)# class-map http_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 80

hostname(config)# policy-map http_traffic_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http
hostname(config-pmap-c)# police output 250000
hostname(config)# service-policy http_traffic_policy interface outside

```

### Applying Inspection to HTTP Traffic Globally

In this example, any HTTP connection (TCP traffic
on port 80) that enters the ASA through any interface is classified for HTTP
inspection. Because the policy is a global policy, inspection occurs only as
the traffic enters each interface.

See the following commands for this example:

```

hostname(config)# class-map http_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 80

hostname(config)# policy-map http_traffic_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http
hostname(config)# service-policy http_traffic_policy global

```

### Applying Inspection and Connection Limits to HTTP Traffic to Specific Servers

In this example, any HTTP connection destined for
Server A (TCP traffic on port 80) that enters the ASA through the outside
interface is classified for HTTP inspection and maximum connection limits.
Connections initiated from Server A to Host A do not match the ACL in the class
map, so they are not affected.

Any HTTP connection destined for Server B that
enters the ASA through the inside interface is classified for HTTP inspection.
Connections initiated from Server B to Host B do not match the ACL in the class
map, so they are not affected.

See the following commands for this example:

```

hostname(config)# object network obj-192.168.1.2
hostname(config-network-object)# host 192.168.1.2
hostname(config-network-object)# nat (inside,outside) static 209.165.201.1
hostname(config)# object network obj-192.168.1.0
hostname(config-network-object)# subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
hostname(config-network-object)# nat (inside,outside) dynamic 209.165.201.2
hostname(config)# access-list serverA extended permit tcp any host 209.165.201.1 eq 80
hostname(config)# access-list ServerB extended permit tcp any host 209.165.200.227 eq 80

hostname(config)# class-map http_serverA
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list serverA
hostname(config)# class-map http_serverB
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list serverB

hostname(config)# policy-map policy_serverA
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_serverA
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 100
hostname(config)# policy-map policy_serverB
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_serverB
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http

hostname(config)# service-policy policy_serverB interface inside
hostname(config)# service-policy policy_serverA interface outside

```

### Applying Inspection to HTTP Traffic with NAT

In this example, the Host on the inside network
has two addresses: one is the real IP address 192.168.1.1, and the other is a
mapped IP address used on the outside network, 209.165.200.225. You must use
the real IP address in the ACL in the class map. If you applied it to the
outside interface, you would also use the real address.

See the following commands for this example:

```

hostname(config)# object network obj-192.168.1.1
hostname(config-network-object)# host 192.168.1.1
hostname(config-network-object)# nat (VM1,outside) static 209.165.200.225

hostname(config)# access-list http_client extended permit tcp host 192.168.1.1 any eq 80

hostname(config)# class-map http_client
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list http_client

hostname(config)# policy-map http_client
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_client
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http

hostname(config)# service-policy http_client interface inside

```

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

# Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Compatibility Guide

This guide provides software and hardware compatibility for Cisco Secure
Firewall Threat Defense. For related compatibility guides, see the following table.

| **Note** | ---   Not all software versions, especially patches, apply to all platforms. A quick way to tell if a version is supported is that its upgrade/installation packages are posted on the Cisco Support & Download site. If the site is "missing" an upgrade or installation package, that version is not supported. You can also check the release notes and [End-of-Life Announcements](#id_85448). If you feel a version is missing in error, contact Cisco TAC.   --- |

## Suggested Release: Version 7.4.2

To take advantage of new features and resolved issues, we recommend you upgrade all
eligible appliances to at least the suggested release, including the latest patch.
On the Cisco Support & Download
site, the suggested release is marked with a gold star. In Version 7.2.6+/7.4.1+, the
management center notifies you when a new suggested release is available, and
indicates suggested releases on its product upgrades page.

### Suggested Releases for Older Appliances

If an appliance is too old to run the suggested release and you do not plan to
refresh the hardware right now, choose a major version then patch as far as
possible. Some major versions are designated *long-term* or *extra
long-term*, so consider one of those. For an explanation of these terms, see
[Cisco NGFW Product Line Software
Release and Sustaining Bulletin](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/firewalls/bulletin-c25-743178.html).

If you are interested in a hardware refresh, contact your Cisco representative or
partner contact.

## Threat Defense Platform Summary

These tables summarize the supported devices and on-prem (customer-deployed)
management methods for threat
defense.

| **Note** | ---   The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center can manage threat defense 7.0.3 to 7.6.0 (except 7.1). For Security Cloud Control with device manager, you must be running at least threat defense 6.4.   --- |

## Threat Defense Hardware

### Firepower 1000/2100 Series

Firepower 1000/2100 series devices use the FXOS operating
system. Upgrading threat defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled
FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425). These devices can also run ASA instead of threat defense; see [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

### Secure Firewall 3100/4200 Series

Secure Firewall 3100/4200 series devices use the FXOS operating system. How FXOS is upgraded depends on
whether the device is in application mode or multi-instance mode. These devices can
also run ASA instead of threat defense; see [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

#### Application Mode

In application mode, upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

#### Multi-Instance Mode

In multi-instance mode, you upgrade the chassis (FXOS and firmware) and threat
defense separately. However, one package contains both components. It is possible to
have a chassis-only upgrade or a threat defense-only upgrade. For information on
bundled FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Although you can run older threat defense instances on a newer
FXOS, new features and resolved issues
often require a full upgrade.

### Firepower 4100/9300

For the Firepower 4100/9300, major threat
defense versions have a specially qualified and recommended companion FXOS version,
listed below in **bold**. Use these combinations whenever possible, because we
perform enhanced testing for them. Note that the table lists the minimum build for
each FXOS version, but in most cases we recommend the latest. For more information,
see the [Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS Release
Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-9000-series/products-release-notes-list.html).

| **Note** | ---   Although we document that FXOS 2.14.1.163+ is required for threat defense 7.4.x, this is for reimaging to 7.4.2+. If you are already running an earlier FXOS 2.14.1 build, you can successfully upgrade to 7.4.2+ without upgrading FXOS ([CSCwf64429](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf64429)).   --- |
| --- | --- |

These devices can also run ASA instead of threat
defense. With ASA 9.12+ and threat
defense 6.4.0+, you can run both ASA and threat
defense on separate modules in the same Firepower 9300 chassis. For more information, see
[Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/compatibility/fxos-compatibility.html).

## Threat Defense High Availability and Clustering

These tables list threat defense support for high availability and clustering. For
threat defense hardware, support differs depending on whether you are using
standalone devices (also called native instances or application mode) or container
instances (also called multi-instance mode). Threat defense virtual does not support
container instances.

### Standalone Devices

This table lists threat defense hardware support for high availability and clustering
with standalone devices. In management center deployments, all threat defense
hardware supports high availability. For device manager, high availability support
begins in Version 6.3 and clustering is not supported.

Threat Defense Management

## On-Prem Management Center

All devices support remote management with a customer-deployed (*on-prem*)
management center.

Versions are major (A.x), maintenance (A.x.y), or patch (A.x.y.z). The management
center should run the same or newer version as its devices. New features and
resolved issues often require the latest version on both the management center and its devices, including patches. Upgrade the management center first—you will still be able to manage older devices, usually a few major
versions
back

| **Note** | ---   You cannot upgrade a device past the management center to a newer major or maintenance version. Although a patched device (fourth-digit) can be managed with an unpatched management center, fully patched deployments undergo enhanced testing.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Note
that in most cases you can upgrade an older device directly to the management center's major or maintenance version. However, sometimes you can manage an older
device that you cannot directly upgrade, even though the target version is
supported on the device. And rarely, there are issues with specific management center-device combinations. For release-specific requirements, see the release
notes.

## Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center

The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center can manage threat
defense devices running **Version 7.0.3 to 7.6.0 (except Version 7.1)**.

You can co-manage a cloud-managed device with a Version 7.2+ on-prem management center for event logging and analytics purposes only. Or, you can send security events
to the Cisco cloud with Security
Analytics and Logging (SaaS).

### Co-managing Devices with an Analytics Management Center

The cloud-delivered Firewall
Management Center supports a wider range of managed device versions than on-prem management
centers. This can cause issues if you use an on-prem management center for
analytics because devices can be "too old" or "too new" to co-manage.

You can be prevented from:

* Registering newer devices to the analytics management center because
  older devices are blocking the required management center upgrade.
* Upgrading co-managed devices to the latest release, because the analytics
  management center is "stuck" at an older release.
* Reverting device upgrade, if revert would take the device out of
  compatibility with the analytics management center.

For example, consider a scenario where you want to add co-managed Version 7.6.0
devices to a deployment that currently includes co-managed Version 7.0.x
devices. The cloud-delivered Firewall
Management Center can manage this full range of devices, but the on-prem analytics management
center cannot.

In order of preference, you can:

* Upgrade the Version 7.0.x devices to at least Version 7.2.0, upgrade the
  analytics management center to Version 7.6.0, then add the Version 7.6.0
  devices to both management centers.
* Remove the Version 7.0.x devices from the analytics management center,
  upgrade the analytics management center to Version 7.6.0, then add the
  Version 7.6.0 devices to both management centers.
* Leave the analytics management center as it is and do not add your
  Version 7.6.0 devices.

That is, your choices are:

* To get events from all devices, upgrade (or replace) the analytics
  management center and your older devices.
* To forgo events from older devices, upgrade (or replace) the analytics
  management center only.
* To forgo events from newer devices, leave the analytics management center
  at an older release.

## Device Manager

You can use device
manager to locally manage a single threat
defense device. Most models suppport local management.

Optionally, add Cisco Security Cloud Control to remotely manage multiple threat
defense devices, as an alternative to the management center. Although some configurations still require device
manager, Security Cloud Control allows you to establish and maintain consistent security policies across your threat
defense deployment.

## Bundled Components

These tables list the versions of various
components bundled with threat
defense. Use this information to identify open or resolved bugs in bundled components
that may affect your deployment.

Note that sometimes we release updated builds for select releases. If bundled
components change from build to build, we list the components in the *latest*
build. (In most cases, only the latest build is available for
download.)
For details on new builds and the issues they resolve, see the release notes for
your version.

### Operating Systems

ASA 5500-X series and ISA 3000 devices use the ASA operating system. Firepower
1000/2100, Secure Firewall 1200, and Secure Firewall 3100/4200 series devices use
the FXOS operating system. For the Firepower 4100/9300, see [Firepower 4100/9300](#reference_6DF211D8F60F423387D0316000333539).

### System Databases

The vulnerability database (VDB) is a database of known vulnerabilities to which
hosts may be susceptible, as well as fingerprints for operating systems, clients,
and applications. The system uses the VDB to help determine whether a particular
host increases your risk of compromise.

The geolocation database (GeoDB) is a database that you can leverage to view and
filter traffic based on geographical location.

  Analytics and Logging On Prem app for the Stealthwatch Management Console
  (SMC). For information on Stealthwatch Enterprise (SWE) requirements for the
  SMC, see [Cisco Security Analytics
  and Logging On Premises: Firepower Event Integration
  Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/security-analytics-logging/products-installation-guides-list.html).
* Cisco SecureX integration, which was available with
  Version 6.4–7.4, has now reached end of support. For a replacement
  technology, contact your Cisco representative or partner contact.

### Threat Defense Remote Access VPN

Remote access virtual private network (RA VPN) allows individual users to connect to
your network from a remote location using a computer or supported mobile device.
Keep in mind that newer threat defense features can require newer versions of the
client.

For more information, see the [Cisco Secure Client/AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
configuration guides](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

## Browser Requirements

### Browsers

We test with the latest versions of these popular browsers, running on currently
supported versions of macOS and Microsoft Windows:

Table 24. Browsers

| Browser | Device Manager Version |
| --- | --- |
| Google Chrome | Any |
| Mozilla Firefox | Any |
| Microsoft Edge (Windows only) | Version 6.7+ |
| Apple Safari | Not extensively tested. Feedback welcome. |

If you encounter issues with any other browser, or are running an operating system
that has reached end of life, we ask that you switch or upgrade. If you continue to
encounter issues or have feedback, contact Cisco TAC.

### Browser Settings and Extensions

Regardless of browser, keep JavaScript and
cookies enabled.
If you are using Microsoft Edge, do *not* enable IE mode.

Note that some browser extensions can prevent you from saving values in fields like
the certificate and key in PKI objects. These extensions include, but are not
limited to, Grammarly and Whatfix Editor. This happens because these extensions
insert characters (such as HTML) in the fields, which causes the system to see them
invalid. We recommend you disable these extensions while you’re logged into our
products.

### Screen Resolution

Table 25. Screen Resolution

| **Interface** | **Minimum Resolution** |
| --- | --- |
| Device manager | 1024 x 768 |
| Chassis manager for the Firepower 4100/9300 | 1024 x 768 |

### Securing Communications

When you first log in, the system uses a self-signed digital certificate to secure
web communications. Your browser should display an untrusted authority warning, but
also should allow you to add the certificate to the trust store. Although this will
allow you to continue, we do recommend that you replace the self-signed certificate
with a certificate signed by a globally known or internally trusted certificate
authority (CA).

To begin replacing the self-signed certificate on device manager, click
Device, then the System Settings > Management Access link, then the Management Web Server tab.
For detailed procedures, see the online help or the [Cisco
Secure Firewall Device Manager Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-ngfw/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

| **Note** | ---   If you do not replace the self-signed certificate:   * Google Chrome does not cache static content, such as images, CSS, or   JavaScript. Especially in low bandwidth environments, this can extend   page load times. * Mozilla Firefox can stop trusting the self-signed certificate when the   browser updates. If this happens, you can refresh Firefox, keeping in   mind that you will lose some settings; see Mozilla's *[Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings)* support   page.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Browsing from a Monitored Network

Many browsers use Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3 by default. If you are using an
SSL policy to handle encrypted traffic, and people in your monitored network use
browsers with TLS v1.3 enabled, websites that support TLS v1.3 may fail to load.

| **Note** | ---   In Version 6.2.3 and earlier, websites that support TLS v1.3 always fail to load. As a workaround, you can configure managed devices to remove extension 43 (TLS 1.3) from ClientHello negotiation; see the software advisory titled: [*Failures loading websites using TLS 1.3 with SSL inspection enabled*](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/SA/SW_Advisory_CSCvh22181.html). In Version 6.2.3.7+, you can specify when to downgrade; see the system support  commands in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense.html) after consulting with Cisco TAC.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## End-of-Life Announcements

The following tables provide end-of-life details. Dates that have passed
are in **bold**.

### Snort

If you are still using the Snort 2 inspection engine with threat defense, switch to Snort 3
now for improved detection and performance. It is available starting in threat defense
Version 6.7+ (with device manager) and Version 7.0+ (with management center). Snort 2 will
be deprecated in a future release. You will eventually be unable to upgrade
Snort 2 devices.

In management center deployments, upgrading to threat defense Version
7.2+ also upgrades eligible Snort 2 devices to Snort
3.
For devices that are ineligible because they use custom intrusion or network analysis
policies, manually upgrade Snort. See Migrate from Snort 2 to Snort 3 in the
[Cisco Secure Firewall
Management Center Snort 3 Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/go/fmc-snort3).

In device manager deployments, manually upgrade Snort. See Intrusion Policies
in the [Cisco
Secure Firewall Device Manager Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-ngfw/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

These software versions on still-supported branches have been removed
from the Cisco Support & Download
site.

| **Note** | ---   In Version 6.2.3+, uninstalling a patch (fourth-digit release) results in an appliance running the version you upgraded from. This means that you can end up running a deprecated version simply by uninstalling a later patch. Unless otherwise stated, do *not* remain at a deprecated version. Instead, we recommend you upgrade. If upgrade is impossible, uninstall the deprecated patch.   --- |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Policy Deployment

| **Caution** | ---   Do NOT push the FMC deployments over a VPN tunnel that is terminating directly on the Firepower Threat Defense. Pushing the FMC deployments can potentially inactivate the tunnel and disconnect the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.  Recovering the device from this situation can be very disruptive and require executing the disaster recovery procedure. This procedure resets the Firepower Threat Defense configuration to factory defaults by changing manager from FMC to local and configuring the device from beginning. For more information, see [Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel](#ID-2176-0000040d__section_pq5_jly_2tb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

After you configure your deployment, and any time you change that configuration, you must deploy the changes to affected devices.
You can view deployment status in the Message Center.

Deploying updates the following components:

* Device and interface configurations
* Device-related policies: NAT, VPN, QoS, platform settings
* Access control and related policies: DNS, file, identity, intrusion, network analysis, prefilter, SSL
* Network discovery policy
* Intrusion rule
  updates
* Configurations and objects associated with any of these elements

You can configure the system to deploy automatically by scheduling a deploy task or by setting the system to deploy when importing
intrusion rule updates. Automating policy deployment is especially useful if you allow intrusion rule updates to modify system-provided
base policies for intrusion and network analysis. Intrusion rule updates can also modify default values for the advanced preprocessing
and performance options in your access control policies.

In a multidomain deployment, you can deploy changes for any domain where your user account belongs:

* Switch to an ancestor domain to deploy changes to all subdomains at the same time.
* Switch to a leaf domain to deploy changes to only that domain.

### Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes

The following are guidelines for deploying configuration changes.

#### Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel

You can deploy the FMC policy configuration over a VPN tunnel, only if the deployment is for a device that does not terminate the tunnel. The FMC to Firepower Threat Defense management traffic should be its own secure transport SF tunnel and does not need to be over S2S VPN tunnel for any connectivity.

For policy-based VPN tunnel, choose the protected networks on both side to exclude the FMC to Firepower Threat Defense management traffic. For route-based VPN tunnel, configure the routing to exclude the FMC to Firepower Threat Defense management traffic to the VTI interface.

When you push the FMC deployments over the VPN tunnel with the management traffic that is also passing through the tunnel, in the event of any
VPN misconfiguration, it inactivates the tunnel and results in disconnecting the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.

To reinstantiate the tunnel configuration, you can either:

* Remove the sensor from the Firepower Threat Defense and the FMC (resulting in losing all of its configuration), and then add the sensor again to the FMC.

  Or
* Contact Cisco TAC.

  | **Note** | ---   Reinstantiating the tunnel configuration requires overhauling of the system.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

#### Inline vs Passive Deployments

Do not apply inline configurations to devices deployed passively, and vice versa.

#### Time to Deploy and Memory Limitations

The time it takes to deploy depends on multiple factors, including (but not limited to):

* The configurations you send to the device. For example, if you dramatically increase the number of Security Intelligence entries
  you block, deploy can take longer.
* Device model and memory. On lower-memory devices, deploying can take longer.

Do not exceed the capability of your devices. If you exceed the maximum number of rules or policies supported by a target
device, the system displays a warning. The maximum depends on a number of factors—not only memory and the number of processors
on the device, but also on policy and rule complexity. For information on optimizing policies and rules, see [Best Practices for Access Control Rules](best_practices_for_access_control.html#ID-2176-000005b6).

#### Interruptions to Traffic Flow and Inspection During Deploy

When you deploy, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection. Additionally, deploying
some configurations restarts the Snort process, which interrupts traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption
or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) and [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).

For Firepower Threat Defense devices, the Inspect Interruption column in the Deploy dialog warns you when deploying might interrupt traffic flow or inspection. You can either proceed with,
cancel, or delay deployment; see [Restart Warnings for the FTD Devices](#id_65425) for more information.

| **Caution** | ---   We *strongly* recommend you deploy in a maintenance window or at a time when interruptions will have the least impact.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Auto-Enabling Application Detectors

If you are performing application control but disable required detectors, the system automatically enables the appropriate
system-provided detectors upon policy deploy. If none exist, the system enables the most recently modified user-defined detector
for the application.

#### Asset Rediscovery with Network Discovery Policy Changes

When you deploy changes to a network discovery policy, the system deletes and then rediscovers MAC address, TTL, and hops
information from the network map for the hosts in your monitored networks. Also, the affected managed devices discard any
discovery data that has not yet been sent to the FMC.

**Related Concepts**
[Snort® Restart Scenarios](#concept_33516C5D6B574B6888B1A05F956ABDF9)

### Restart Warnings for the FTD Devices

When you deploy, the Inspect Interruption column in the deploy page specifies whether a deployed configuration restarts the Snort process on the Firepower Threat Defense device. When the traffic inspection engine referred to as *the Snort process* restarts, inspection is interrupted until the process resumes. Whether traffic is interrupted or passes without inspection
during the interruption depends on how the device handles traffic. Note that you can proceed with the deployment, cancel the
deployment and modify the configuration, or delay the deployment until a time when deploying would have the least impact on
your network.

When the Inspect Interruption column indicates Yes and you expand the device configuration listing, the system indicates any specific configuration type that would restart
the Snort process with an Inspect
Interruption (![inspect interruption icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/447001-448000/447700.jpg)). When you hover your mouse over the icon, a message informs you that deploying the configuration may interrupt traffic.

The following table summarizes how the deploy page displays inspection interruption warnings.

Table 1. Inspection Interruption Indicators

| Type | Inspect Interruption | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FTD | Inspect Interruption (inspect interruption icon)Yes | At least one configuration would interrupt inspection on the device if deployed, and might interrupt traffic depending on how the device handles traffic. You can expand the device configuration listing for more information. |
| -- | Deployed configurations will not interrupt traffic on the device. |
| Undetermined | The system cannot determine if a deployed configuration may interrupt traffic on the device.  Undetermined status is displayed before the first deployment after a software upgrade, or in some cases during a Support call. |
| Errors (error icon) | The system cannot determine the status due to an internal error.  Cancel the operation and click Deploy again to allow the system to redetermine the Inspect Interruption status. If the problem persists, contact Support. |
| sensor | -- | The device identified as *sensor* is not the Firepower Threat Defense device; the system does not determine if a deployed configuration may interrupt traffic on this device. |

For information on all configurations that restart the Snort process for all device types, see [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).

### Deployment Status

On the Deployment page, the Status column provides the deployment status for each device. If a deployment is in progress, then the live status of the deployment
progress is displayed, else one of the following statuses is displayed:

* Pending—Indicates that there are changes in the device that are to be deployed.
* Warnings or errors—Indicates that the pre-deployment checks have identified warnings or errors for the deployment, and you
  have not proceeded with the deployment. You can continue with the deployment if there are any warnings, but not if there are
  any errors.

  | **Note** | ---   The status column provides the warning or error status only for a single user session on the deployment page. If you navigate away from the page or refresh the page, the status changes to pending.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Failed—Indicates that the previous deployment attempt failed. Click on the status to view the details.
* In queue—Indicates that deployment is initiated, and the system is yet to start the deployment process.
* Completed—Indicates that deployment has completed successfully.

### Deployment Estimate

The Estimate link is available on the Deployment page after you select a device, a policy, or a configuration. Click the Estimate link to get an estimate of the deployment duration. The time duration is a rough estimate (having around 70% accuracy), and
the actual time taken for deployment may vary for a few scenarios. Refer to the deployment duration estimate for deployments
to a few Firepower Threat Defenses. The estimate is dependable for deployments of up to 20 Firepower Threat Defense devices.

When an estimate is not available, it indicates that the data is not available, since the first successful deployment on the
selected device is pending. This situation could occur after the FMC version upgrade or after a fresh installation.

| **Note** | ---   The estimate is incorrect and unreliable for bulk policy changes (in case of bulk policy migrations), and selective deployments because the estimate is based on the heuristic technique.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Deployment Preview

Preview provides a snapshot of all the policy and object changes to be deployed on the device. The policy changes include
the new policies, changes in the existing policies, and the deleted policies. The object changes include the added and modified
objects which are used in policies. The unused object changes are not displayed because they are not deployed on the device.

On the Deployment page, the Preview column provides a Preview (![preview icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/448001-449000/448387.jpg)) icon for each listed device. On clicking the preview icon, FMC displays a UI page listing all the policy and object changes. The left pane on the preview page lists all the different policy
types that have changed on the device, organized in a tree structure.

The right pane lists all the additions, changes, or deletions in the policy, or the object selected in the left pane. The
two columns on the right pane provide the last deployed configuration settings (in the Deployed Version column) versus the changes that are due for deployment (in the Version on Firewall Management Center column). The last deployed configuration settings are derived from a snapshot of the last saved deployment in the FMC and not from the device. The background colors of the settings are color-coded as per the legend available on the top-right
of the page.

Deployment preview of changes to Security Intelligence, Geolocation, Sinkhole, and File List objects is supported. For an
explanation of these and other reusable objects supported in the FMC, see the chapter titled [Reusable Objects](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/reusable_objects.html).

| **Note** | ---  * To preview the deploy changes, you require access from the REST API to the FMC. To enable the REST API access, follow the steps in [Enabling REST API Access](system_configuration.html#id_26813). * The preview does not show the reordering of rules across policies. * The preview shows all the default values, even when they are not altered, along with the other configured settings when an   interface or a platform settings policy is added for the first time. Similarly, the high availability-related policies and   default values for settings are shown, even when they are not altered, in the first preview after a high availability pair   is configured or disrupted. * Preview is not supported for some objects. * Object additions and attribute changes are displayed in the preview only if the objects are associated with any device or   interface. Object deletions are not displayed. * Preview is not supported for the following policies:    + High availability   + Network discovery   + Network analysis   + Device settings   + Flex config  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Selective Policy Deployment

| **Caution** | ---   Do NOT push the FMC deployments over a VPN tunnel that is terminating directly on the Firepower Threat Defense. Pushing the FMC deployments can potentially inactivate the tunnel and disconnect the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.  Recovering the device from this situation can be very disruptive and require executing the disaster recovery procedure. This procedure resets the Firepower Threat Defense configuration to factory defaults by changing manager from FMC to local and configuring the device from beginning. For more information, see [Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel](#ID-2176-0000040d__section_pq5_jly_2tb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

The FMC allows you to select a specific policy within the list of all the changes on the device that are due for deployment and deploy
only the selected policy. Selectively deployment is available only for the following policies:

* Access control policies
* Intrusion policies
* Malware and file policies
* DNS policies
* Identity policies
* SSL policies
* QoS policies
* Prefilter policies
* Network discovery
* NAT policies
* Routing policies

On the deployment page, after you click Expand Arrow
(![expand arrow icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/448001-449000/448385.jpg)) to view device-specific configuration changes, Policy selection
 (![policy selection icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/447001-448000/447698.jpg)) icon is visible. The policy selection icon allows you to select individual policies or configurations to deploy while withholding
the remaining listed changes without deploying them. This option is available only for Firepower Threat Defenses and not for sensors. You can also view the interdependent changes for a certain policy or configuration using this option.
The FMC dynamically detects dependencies in-between policies (for example, between an access control policy and an intrusion policy),
and between the shared objects and the policies. Interdependent changes are indicated using color-coded tags to identify a
set of interdependent deployment changes. When one of the deployment changes is selected, the interdependent changes are automatically
selected.

| **Note** | ---  * When the changes in shared objects are deployed, the impacted policies should also be deployed along with them. When you select   a shared object during deployment, the impacted policies are automatically selected. * Selective deployment is not supported for scheduled deployments and deployments using REST APIs. You can only opt for complete   deployment of all the changes in these cases. * The pre-deployment checks for warnings and errors are performed not only on the selected policies, but on all the policies   that are out-of-date. Therefore, the warnings or errors list shows the deselected policies as well. * Similarly, the Inspect Interruption column indication on the Deployment page considers all out-of-date policies and not just the selected policies. For information   on the Inspect Interruption column, see [Restart Warnings for the FTD Devices](#id_65425).  --- |
| --- | --- |

There are certain limitations to selectively deploying policies. Follow the contents in the table below to understand when
selective policy deployment can be used.

Table 2. Limitations for Selective Deployment

| Type | Description | Scenarios |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full deployment | Full deployment is necessary for specific deploy scenarios, and the FMC does not support selective deployment in such scenarios. If you encounter an error in such scenarios, you may choose to proceed by selecting all the changes for deployment on the device. | Scenarios wherein a full deployment is required are:   * The first deployment after you have upgraded the Firepower Threat Defense or FMC. * The first deployment after you have restored the Firepower Threat Defense. * The first deployment after modifications in the Firepower Threat Defense interface settings. * The first deployment after modifications in the virtual router settings. * When the Firepower Threat Defense device is moved to a new domain (global to sub-domain or sub-domain to global). |
| Associated policy deployment | The FMC identifies interdependent policies which are interlinked. When one of the interlinked policies is selected, the remaining interlinked policies are automatically selected. | Scenarios wherein an associated policy is automatically selected:   * When a new object is associated with an existing policy. * When an existing policy's object is modified.   Scenarios wherein multiple policies are automatically selected:   * When a new object is associated with an existing policy, and the same object is already associated with other policies, all   the associated policies are automatically selected. * When a shared object is modified, all the associated policies are automatically selected. |
| Interdependent policy changes (shown using color-coded tags) | The FMC dynamically detects dependencies in-between policies, and between the shared objects and the policies. The interdependency of the objects or policies is shown using color-coded tags. | Scenarios wherein color-coded interdependent policies or objects are automatically selected:   * When all the out-of-date policies have interdependent changes.  For example, when an access control policy, an intrusion policy, and a NAT policy are out-of-date. Since access control policy   and NAT policy share an object, all policies are selected together for deployment. * When all out-of-date policies share an object, and the object is modified. |
| Access Policy Group specifications | Access Policy Group policies are listed together in the preview window under Access Policy Group when you click Show or Hide Policy  (Show or Hide Policy icon). | The scenarios and the expected behavior for Access Policy Group policies are:   * If the access control policy is out-of-date, all other out-of-date policies under this group, except file policy and intrusion   policy, are selected when the access control policy is selected for deployment.  However, if the access control policy is out-of-date, intrusion and file policies can be individually selected or deselected   irrespective of whether the access control policy is selected or not, unless there are any dependent changes. For example,   if a new intrusion policy is assigned to an access control rule, it indicates that there are dependent changes, then both   the access control policy and the intrusion policy will be automatically selected when either of them is selected. * If no access control policy is out-of-date, other out-of-date policies in this group can be selected and deployed individually. |

### Deploy Configuration Changes

| **Caution** | ---   Do NOT push the FMC deployments over a VPN tunnel that is terminating directly on the Firepower Threat Defense. Pushing the FMC deployments can potentially inactivate the tunnel and disconnect the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.  Recovering the device from this situation can be very disruptive and require executing the disaster recovery procedure. This procedure resets the Firepower Threat Defense configuration to factory defaults by changing manager from FMC to local and configuring the device from beginning. For more information, see [Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel](#ID-2176-0000040d__section_pq5_jly_2tb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

After you change configurations, deploy them to the affected devices. We *strongly* recommend that you deploy in a maintenance window or at a time when any interruptions to traffic flow and inspection will
have the least impact.

| **Caution** | ---  When you deploy, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection. Additionally, deploying some configurations restarts the Snort process, which interrupts traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) and [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

* Review the guidelines described in [Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes](#ID-2176-0000040d).
* Be sure all managed devices use the same revision of the Security Zones object. If you have edited security zone objects:
  Do not deploy configuration changes to any device until you edit the zone setting for interfaces on *all* devices you want to sync. You must deploy to all managed devices at the same time. See [Synchronizing Security Zone Object Revisions](classic_device_management_basics.html#ID-2242-0000130d).

| **Note** | ---  Policy deployment process fails if the sensor configuration is being read by the system during deployment. Executing commands such as `show running-config` from the sensor CLI disturbs the deployment, which results in deployment failure.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the FMC menu bar, click Deploy and then select Deployment.  The GUI page lists the devices with out-of-date configurations having the pending status.   * The Inspect Interruption column indicates if traffic inspection interruption may be caused in the device during deployment. See [Restart Warnings for the FTD Devices](#id_65425) for information to help you identify configurations that interrupt traffic inspection and might interrupt traffic when deployed   to Firepower Threat Defense devices.  If the entry is blank in this column for a device, then it indicates that there will be no traffic inspection interruptions   on that device during deployment. * The Last Modified Time column specifies when you last made the configuration changes. * The Preview column allows you to preview the changes for the next deployment. For more information, see [Deployment Preview](#Cisco_Concept.dita_44f4e6ea-cdb6-41e7-974a-2573b51e3825 "Deployment preview provides a snapshot of all the policy and object changes to be deployed on the device. The policy changes include the new policies, changes in the existing policies, and the deleted policies. The object changes include the added and modified objects which are used in policies."). * The Status column provides the status for each deployment. For more information, see [Deployment Status](#dep_status_estimate_1). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Identify and choose the devices on which you want to deploy configuration changes.   * Search—Search for the device name, type, domain, group, or status in the search box. * Expand—Click Expand Arrow   (expand arrow icon) to view device-specific configuration changes to be deployed. By selecting the device check box, all the changes for the device, which are listed under the device, are pushed for deployment.   However, you can use the Policy selection    (policy selection icon) to select individual policies or configurations to deploy while withholding the remaining changes without deploying them.   For details, see [Selective Policy Deployment](#select_pol_dep_1).  Optionally, use Show or Hide Policy    (Show or Hide Policy icon) to selectively view or hide the associated unmodified policies.       | **Note** | + When the status in the Inspect Interruption column indicates (Yes) that deploying will interrupt inspection, and perhaps traffic, on a Firepower Threat Defense device, the expanded list indicates the specific configurations causing the interruption with the Inspect   Interruption (inspect interruption icon). + When there are changes to interface groups, security zones, or objects, the impacted devices are shown as out-of-date on the   FMC. To ensure that these changes take effect, the policies with these interface groups, security zones, or objects, also need   to be deployed along with these changes. The impacted policies are shown as out-of-date on the Preview page on the FMC. |   | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) Click Estimate to get a rough estimate of the deployment duration.  For more details, see [Deployment Estimate](#dep_status_estimate_1). |
| **Step 4** | Click Deploy. |
| **Step 5** | If the system identifies errors or warnings in the changes to be deployed, it displays them in the Validation Messages  window. To view complete details, click the arrow icon before the warnings or errors.  You have the following choices:   * Deploy—Continue deploying without resolving warning conditions. You cannot proceed if the system identifies errors. * Close—Exit without deploying. Resolve the error and warning conditions, and attempt to deploy the configuration again. |

---

#### What to do next

* (Optional) Monitor deployment status; see [Viewing Deployment Messages](troubleshooting_the_system.html#task_91DA35534C6A4937BE7F16E770E3C510).
* If deploy fails, see [Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes](#ID-2176-0000040d).
* During deployment, if there is a deployment failure due to any reason, there is a possibility that the failure may impact
  traffic. However, it depends on certain conditions. If there are specific configuration changes in the deployment, the deployment
  failure may lead to traffic being interrupted. See the following table to know what configuration changes may cause traffic
  interruption when deployment fails.

  | Configuration Changes | Exists? | Traffic Impacted? |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | **Threat Defense Service** changes in an access control policy | Yes | Yes |
  | VRF | Yes | Yes |
  | Interface | Yes | Yes |
  | QoS | Yes | Yes |

  | **Note** | ---   The configuration changes interrupting traffic during deployment is valid only if both the FMC and Firepower Threat Defense are of version 6.2.3 or higher.   --- |

### Redeploy Existing Configurations to a Device

You can force-deploy existing (unchanged) configurations to a single managed device. We *strongly* recommend you deploy in a maintenance window or at a time when any interruptions to traffic flow and inspection will have
the least impact.

| **Caution** | ---  When you deploy, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection. Additionally, deploying some configurations restarts the Snort process, which interrupts traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) and [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Review the guidelines described in [Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes](#ID-2176-0000040d).

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Devices > Device Management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Edit (edit icon) next to the device where you want to force deployment.  In a multidomain deployment, if you are not in a leaf domain, the system prompts you to switch. |
| **Step 3** | Click Device. |
| **Step 4** | Click Edit (edit icon) next to the General section heading. |
| **Step 5** | Click Force Deploy (force deploy icon).   | **Note** | Force-deploy takes more time than the regular deployment because it involves the complete generation of the policy rules to be deployed on the FTD. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 6** | Click Deploy.  The system identifies any errors or warnings with the configurations you are deploying. You can click Proceed to continue without resolving warning conditions. However, you cannot proceed if the system identifies an error. |

---

#### What to do next

* (Optional) Monitor deployment status; see [Viewing Deployment Messages](troubleshooting_the_system.html#task_91DA35534C6A4937BE7F16E770E3C510).
* If deploy fails, see [Best Practices for Deploying Configuration Changes](#ID-2176-0000040d).

### View Deployment History

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the Firepower Management Center menu bar, click Deploy and then select Deployment History.  A list of all the previous deployment and rollback jobs is displayed in reverse chronological order. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Expand Arrow (expand arrow icon) next to the required deployment job to view the devices included in the job and their deployment statuses. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) Click Transcript Details (transcript details icon) to view the commands sent to the device, and the responses received.  The transcript includes the following sections:   * **Snort Apply**—If there are any failures or responses from Snort-related policies, then the messages are displayed in this section. Normally,   the section is empty. * **CLI Apply**—This section covers features that are configured using commands that are sent to the device.       | **Note** | The transcript for the rollback operation does not provide the CLI commands information. To view the rollback commands, see [View the Deployment Rollback Transcript](#view_rollback_transcript). |   | --- | --- | * **Infrastructure Messages**—This section shows the status of different deployment modules.   In the **CLI Apply** section, the deployment transcript includes commands that are sent to the device, and any responses returned from the device. These responses can be informative messages or error messages. For failed deployments, look for messages that indicate errors with the commands. Examining these errors can be particularly helpful if you are using FlexConfig policies to configure customized features. These errors can help you correct the script in the FlexConfig object that is trying to configure the commands.   | **Note** | There is no distinction that is made in the transcript between commands that are sent for managed features and those generated from FlexConfig policies. | | --- | --- |   For example, the following sequence shows that Firepower Management Center (FMC) sent commands to configure GigabitEthernet0/0 with the logical name *outside*. The device responded that it automatically set the security level to 0. Firepower Threat Defense does not use the security level for anything.  ```  ========= CLI APPLY =========  FMC >> interface GigabitEthernet0/0 FMC >>  nameif outside FTDv 192.168.0.152 >> [info] : INFO: Security level for "outside" set to 0 by default.   ``` |

---

### Deployment Rollback

| **Caution** | ---   Do NOT push the FMC deployments over a VPN tunnel that is terminating directly on the Firepower Threat Defense. Pushing the FMC deployments can potentially inactivate the tunnel and disconnect the FMC and the Firepower Threat Defense.  Recovering the device from this situation can be very disruptive and require executing the disaster recovery procedure. This procedure resets the Firepower Threat Defense configuration to factory defaults by changing manager from FMC to local and configuring the device from beginning. For more information, see [Deploying the FMC Policy Configuration over VPN Tunnel](#ID-2176-0000040d__section_pq5_jly_2tb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

Rollback is a deployment functionality provided to clear the existing deployment on an FTD device and to reconfigure the device
with the previously deployed configuration.

| **Attention** | ---   Rollback is a beta feature. However, the feature is fully supported.   --- |
| --- | --- |

After a policy deployment, if the traffic through an FTD is affected in an unintended way, rollback provides an option to
revert the device to the earlier state, which existed before the faulty deployment.

When a deployment has gone awry and caused traffic interruption in an unintended way, it is recommended that you should identify
the change in the deployment that has caused the condition, and fix it. To know the changes in the previous deployment, go
to Deploy > Deployment History and view the transcript of the last deployment. For additional changes related to the previous deployment, you can refer
to the audit records (see, [Audit Records](auditing_the_system.html#ID-2256-0000001f)). After identifying the change causing the problem, rectify the configuration, and redeploy it on the device. This is the
recommended approach. However, if the change causing the problem is unidentifiable, roll back to the last stable deployed
version on the device.

After a successful rollback operation, go to Deploy > Deployment, and click the Preview icon next to the rolled back device. View the changes between the rolled back configuration and the current changes in the
FMC. Identify the change that has caused the issue and rectify it.

Rollback reverts all the configurations on the device except a few. See the table below for details.

| Configurations that are reverted during a rollback | Configurations that are not reverted during a rollback |
| --- | --- |
| * All policy configurations  * Interface configurations  * SRU configurations * VDB configurations * VPN configurations * FXOS configurations | * Snort binaries * Geo DB |

| **Important** | ---  * Rollback is a disruptive operation. During this operation, all the existing connections and routes are dropped, and the traffic   is disrupted. Rollback removes the current configuration on all the selected FTD devices and reconfigures them with the chosen   rollback version. * Initiate a rollback during low traffic conditions for optimal performance. * Rollback to a particular version can be performed only once. * You can roll back only to the version which is just before the currently deployed version. Rollback to older versions is not   supported. The rollback icon is greyed out for unsupported versions. * Two consecutive rollback operations are not allowed. However, you can rollback again after a deployment. * Rollback reverts the configuration only on the selected FTDs. FMC retains all the changes. With the configuration changes   retained in the FMC, the devices are marked as out-of-date on the FMC after a rollback operation. To see the changes that   are retained in FMC versus the configuration on the device, go to Deploy > Deployment, and click the Preview icon next to the rolled back device. * Be cautious of the changes you want to deploy in the first deployment after you have rolled back, as it would be a full deployment,   and you will not be able to roll back to the rolled back version again. * For FTDs with very large access lists, if the Object Group Search setting is disabled, then the rollback operation may take a longer duration to complete. To verify the Object Group Search setting, go to Devices > Device Management, then select the device and click Edit Advanced Settings.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  * Rollback is supported only on FTD versions 6.7.0 and above. * Rollback is not supported on FTD clusters and NGIPS devices. * Rollback is not supported if the connection interface between the FMC and the FTD is changed from management to data or vice   versa. * In Firepower 4100/9300, when interface changes are made from the Firepower Chassis Manager (FCM) in a previous deployment,   then sync the interfaces using the FCM before initiating a rollback. Failing to do so can cause traffic interruptions. * Independent certificate enrollments are also listed as deployment jobs in the Deployment History page. However, you cannot   rollback to these versions. A rollback from a deployment version created after certificate enrolments reverts the certificate   associations as well. In the next deployment after a rollback, manually associate the certificates before proceeding with   the deployment. * Rollback is not supported on the first version after an upgrade of FMC or FTD. For example, if the FMC is upgraded from 6.7.0   to 6.7.0.1, then you will not be able to roll back to any deployment packages associated with 6.7.0. * If a deployment for a device with a FlexConfig object configured with a deployment frequency set to Once is rolled back, then you will not be able to redeploy the object even though it is displayed as out-of-date on the Preview   page. After a rollback, you will have to manually unassign and then reassign the FlexConfig object to the device before the   next deployment.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Rollback in HA Scenarios

Rollback is not supported in the following HA scenarios:

* When the version you want to roll back to contains the FTD HA bootstrap configuration.
* When the version you want to roll back to contains the FTD HA break configuration.
* When an FTD which is currently in standalone mode, was part of a HA or cluster in the previous deployment version.

* [Roll Back Deployment on a Device](#rollback_task)
* [View the Deployment Rollback Transcript](#view_rollback_transcript)

### Snort® Restart Scenarios

When the traffic inspection engine referred to as *the Snort process* on a managed device restarts, inspection is interrupted until the process resumes. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles
traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) for more information. Additionally, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection when you deploy, regardless
of whether the Snort process restarts.

Any of the scenarios in the following table cause the Snort process to restart.

#### Inspect Traffic During Policy Apply

Inspect traffic during policy apply is an advanced access control policy general setting that allows managed devices to inspect traffic while deploying configuration
changes; this is the case unless a configuration that you deploy requires the Snort process to restart. You can configure
this option as follows:

* Enabled — Traffic is inspected during the deployment unless certain configurations require the Snort process to restart.

  When the configurations you deploy do not require a Snort restart, the system initially uses the currently deployed access
  control policy to inspect traffic, and switches during deployment to the access control policy you are deploying.
* Disabled — Traffic is not inspected during the deployment. The Snort process always restarts when you deploy.

The following graphic illustrates how Snort restarts can occur when you enable or disable Inspect traffic during policy apply.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/400001-410000/407001-408000/407766.jpg)

| **Caution** | ---   When you deploy, resource demands may result in a small number of packets dropping without inspection. Additionally, deploying some configurations restarts the Snort process, which interrupts traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) and [Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated](#reference_F11C552688424DEF85ED145FA97283B7).   --- |

#### Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior

The following tables explain how different devices handle traffic when the Snort process restarts.

Table 4. FTD and FTDv Restart Traffic Effects

| Interface Configuration | Restart Traffic Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| inline: Snort Fail Open: Down: disabled | dropped |
| inline: Snort Fail Open: Down: enabled | passed without inspection  Some packets can be delayed in buffer for several seconds before the system recognizes that Snort is down. This delay can vary depending upon the load distribution. However, the buffered packets are eventually passed. |
| routed, transparent (including EtherChannel, redundant, subinterface): preserve-connection  enabled (configure snort preserve-connection enable ; default)  For more information, see [Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense.html). | existing TCP/UDP flows: passed without inspection so long as at least one packet arrives while Snort is down  new TCP/UDP flows and all non-TCP/UDP flows: dropped  Note that the following traffic drops even when preserve-connection  is enabled:   * plaintext, passthrough prefilter tunnel traffic that   matches an Analyze rule action or an   Analyze all tunnel traffic    default policy action * connections that do not match an access control rule and   are instead handled by the default action. * decrypted TLS/SSL traffic * a safe search flow * a captive portal flow |
| routed, transparent (including EtherChannel, redundant, subinterface): preserve-connection  disabled (configure snort preserve-connection disable ) | dropped |
| inline: tap mode | egress packet immediately, copy bypasses Snort |
| passive | uninterrupted, not inspected |

Table 5. NGIPSv Restart Traffic Effects

| Interface Configuration | Restart Traffic Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| inline: Failsafe enabled or disabled | passed without inspection  A few packets might drop if Failsafe is disabled and Snort is busy but not down. |
| inline: tap mode | egress packet immediately, copy bypasses Snort |
| passive | uninterrupted, not inspected |

Table 6. ASA FirePOWER Restart Traffic Effects

| Interface Configuration | Restart Traffic Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| routed or transparent with fail-open | passed without inspection |
| routed or transparent with fail-close | dropped |

| **Note** | ---  In addition to traffic handling when the Snort process is down while it restarts, traffic can also pass without inspection or drop when the Snort process is busy, depending on the configuration of the Failsafe option (see [Inline Sets](ips_device_deployments_and_configuration.html#ID-2238-0000010e)) or the Snort Fail Open Busy option (see [Configure an Inline Set](inline_sets_and_passive_interfaces_for_firepower_threat_defense.html#task_0E963BC661AA45AF8E7E123430EAA1C4)). A device supports either the Failsafe option or the Snort Fail Open option, but not both.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Warning** | ---  Do not reboot the system while the Snort Rule Update is in progress.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Snort-busy drops happen when snort is not able to process the packets fast enough. Lina does not know whether Snort is busy
due to processing delay, or if is stuck or due to call blocking. When transmission queue is full, snort-busy drops occur.
Based on Transmission queue utilization, Lina will try to access if the queue is being serviced smoothly.

| **Note** | ---  When the Snort process is busy but not down during configuration deployment, some packets may drop on routed, switched, or transparent interfaces if the total CPU load exceeds 60 percent.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Configurations that Restart the Snort Process When Deployed or Activated

Deploying any of the following configurations except AAB restarts the Snort process as described. Deploying AAB does not cause
a restart, but excessive packet latency activates the currently deployed AAB configuration, causing a partial restart of the
Snort process.

##### Access Control Policy Advanced Settings

* Deploy when Inspect Traffic During Policy Apply is disabled.
* Add or remove an SSL policy.

##### File Policy

Deploy the first or last of any one of the following configurations; note that while otherwise deploying these file policy
configurations does not cause a restart, deploying non-file-policy configurations can cause restarts.

* Take either of the following actions:

  + Enable or disable Inspect Archives when the deployed access control policy includes at least one file policy.
  + Add the first or remove the last file policy rule when Inspect Archives is enabled (note that at least one rule is required for Inspect Archives to be meaningful).
* Enable or disable Store files in a Detect Files or Block Files rule.
* Add the first or remove the last active file rule that combines the Malware Cloud Lookup or Block Malware rule action with an analysis option (Spero Analysis or MSEXE, Dynamic Analysis, or Local Malware Analysis) or a store files option (Malware,
  Unknown, Clean, or Custom).

Note that access control rules that deploy these file policy configurations to security zones or tunnel zones cause a restart
only when your configuration meets the following conditions:

* Source or destination security zones in your access control rule must match the security zones associated with interfaces
  on the target devices.
* Unless the destination zone in you access control rule is *any*, a source tunnel zone in the rule must match a tunnel zone assigned to a tunnel rule in the prefilter policy.

##### Identity Policy

* When SSL decryption is disabled (that is, when the access control policy does not include an SSL policy), add the first or
  remove the last active authentication rule.

  An active authentication rule has either an Active Authentication rule action, or a Passive Authentication rule action with Use active authentication if passive or VPN identity cannot be established selected.

##### Network Discovery

* Enable or disable non-authoritative, traffic-based user detection over the HTTP, FTP, or MDNS protocols, using the network
  discovery policy.

##### Device Management

* MTU: Change the highest MTU value among all non-management interfaces on a device.
* Automatic Application Bypass (AAB): The currently deployed AAB configuration activates when a malfunction of the Snort process
  or a device misconfiguration causes a single packet to use an excessive amount of processing time. The result is a partial
  restart of the Snort process to alleviate extremely high latency or prevent a complete traffic stall. This partial restart
  causes a few packets to pass without inspection, or drop, depending on how the device handles traffic.

##### Updates

* System update: Deploy configurations the first time after a software update that includes a new version of the Snort binary
  or data acquisition library (DAQ).
* VDB: Deploying configurations the first time after installing a vulnerability database (VDB) update that includes changes
  applicable to managed devices will require a detection engine restart and may result in a temporary traffic interruption.
  For these, a message warns you when you select the FMC to begin installing. The deploy dialog provides additional warnings for Firepower Threat Defense devices when VDB changes are pending. VDB updates that apply only to the FMC do not cause detection engine restarts, and you cannot deploy them.

**Related Tasks**
[Deploy Configuration Changes](#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B)

#### Changes that Immediately Restart the Snort Process

The following changes immediately restart the Snort process without going through the deploy process. How the restart affects traffic depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) for more information.

* Take any of the following actions involving applications or application detectors:

  + Activate or deactivate a system or custom application detector.
  + Delete an activated custom detector.
  + Save and Reactivate an activated custom detector.
  + Create a user-defined application.

  A message warns you that continuing restarts the Snort process, and allows you to cancel; the restart occurs on any managed
  device in the current domain or in any of its child domains.
* Create or break a Firepower Threat Defense high availability pair—A message warns you that continuing to create a high availability pair restarts the Snort process
  on the primary and secondary devices and allows you to cancel.

## Policy Comparison

To review policy
changes for compliance with your organization's standards or to optimize system
performance, you can examine the differences between two policies or between a
saved policy and the running configuration.

You can compare the
following policy types:

* DNS
* File
* Health
* Identity
* Intrusion (Only Snort 2 policies)
* Network Analysis
* SSL

The comparison view
displays both policies in a side-by-side format. Differences between the two
policies are highlighted:

* Blue indicates
  that the highlighted setting is different in the two policies, and the
  difference is noted in red text.
* Green indicates
  that the highlighted setting appears in one policy but not the other.

* [Comparing Policies](#task_ABA1FE48DBBB44BC9FF40243FCC58BF6)

### Comparing Policies

You can compare policies only if you have access rights and any required licenses for
the specific policy, and you are in the correct domain for configuring the policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Access the management page for the policy you want to compare:   * DNS—Policies > Access Control > DNS * File—Policies > Access Control > Malware & File * Health—System > Health > Policy * Identity—Policies > Access Control > Identity * Intrusion—Policies > Access Control > Intrusion      | **Note** | You can compare only Snort 2 policies. |   | --- | --- | * Network Analysis—Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies      | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. |   | --- | --- | * SSL—Policies > Access Control > SSL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Compare Policies. |
| **Step 3** | From the Compare Against drop-down list, choose the type of comparison you want to make:   * To compare two different policies, choose Other Policy. * To compare two revisions of the same policy, choose Other Revision. * To compare another policy to the currently active policy, choose Running Configuration. |
| **Step 4** | Depending on the comparison type you choose, you have the following choices:   * If you are comparing two different policies, choose the policies you want to compare from the Policy A and Policy B drop-down lists. * If you are comparing the running configuration to another policy, choose the second policy from the Policy B drop-down list. |
| **Step 5** | Click OK. |
| **Step 6** | Review the comparison results:   * Comparison Viewer—To use the comparison viewer to navigate individually through policy differences, click Previous or Next above the title bar. * Comparison Report—To generate a PDF report that lists the differences between the two policies, click Comparison Report. |

---

## Policy Reports

For most policies, you can generate
two kinds of reports. A report on a single policy provides details on the
policy's current saved configuration, while a comparison report lists only the
differences between two policies. You can generate a single-policy report for
all policy types except health.

| **Note** | ---   Intrusion policy reports combine the settings in the base policy with the settings of the policy layers, and make no distinction between which settings originated in the base policy or policy layer.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Generating Current Policy Reports](#task_CCED983433824793AF09203FDAD1AF53)

### Generating Current Policy Reports

You can generate policy reports only if you have access rights and any required
licenses for the specific policy, and you are in the correct domain for configuring
the policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Access the management page for the policy for which you want to generate a report:   * Access Control—Policies > Access Control * DNS—Policies > Access Control > DNS * File—Policies > Access Control > Malware & File * Health—System > Health > Policy * Identity—Policies > Access Control > Identity * Intrusion—Policies > Access Control > Intrusion * Network Analysis—Policies > Access Control, then click Network Analysis Policies or Policies  > Access Control > Intrusion, then click Network Analysis Policies      | **Note** | If your custom user role limits access to the first path listed here, use the second path to access the policy. |   | --- | --- | * SSL—Policies > Access Control > SSL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Report (Report icon) next to the policy for which you want to generate a report. |

---

## Out-of-Date Policies

The Firepower System
marks out-of-date policies with red status text that indicates how many of its
targeted devices need a policy update. To clear this status, you must re-deploy
the policy to the devices.

Configuration changes that require a policy re-deploy include:

* Modifying an access control policy: any changes to access
  control rules, the default action, policy targets, Security Intelligence
  filtering, advanced options including preprocessing, and so on.
* Modifying any of the policies that the access control policy
  invokes: the SSL policy, network analysis policies, intrusion policies, file
  policies, identity policies, or DNS policies.
* Changing any reusable object or configuration used in an access
  control policy or policies it invokes:

  + network, port,
    VLAN tag, URL, and geolocation objects
  + Security
    Intelligence lists and feeds
  + application
    filters or detectors
  + intrusion
    policy variable sets
  + file lists
  + decryption-related objects and security zones
* Updating the system software, intrusion rules, or the
  vulnerability database (VDB).

Keep in mind that you can change some of these configurations
from multiple places in the web interface. For example, you can modify security
zones using the object manager (Objects > Object Management),
but modifying an interface type in a device’s configuration (Devices > Device Management)
can also change a zone and require a policy re-deploy.

Note that the following updates do
**not** require policy re-deploy:

* automatic updates to Security Intelligence feeds and additions to the Security Intelligence global Block or Do Not Block list
  using the context menu
* automatic updates to URL filtering data
* scheduled geolocation database (GeoDB) updates

## Performance Considerations for Limited Deployments

Host, application, and user discovery data allow the system to
create a complete, up-to-the-minute profile of your network. The system can
also act as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IPS), analyzing
network traffic for intrusions and exploits and, optionally, dropping offending
packets.

Combining discovery and IPS gives context to your network
activity and allows you to take advantage of many features, including:

* impact flags and indications of compromise, which can tell you
  which of your hosts are vulnerable to a particular exploit, attack, or piece of
  malware
* adaptive profile updates and Firepower recommendations, which allow you to examine traffic differently depending on the destination host
* correlation, which allows you to respond to intrusions (and
  other events) differently depending on the affected host

However, if your organization is interested in performing only
IPS, or only discovery, there are a few configurations that can optimize the
performance of the system.

* [Discovery Without Intrusion Prevention](#ID-2176-00000563)
* [Intrusion Prevention Without Discovery](#ID-2176-00000598)

### Discovery Without Intrusion Prevention

The
*discovery* feature allows you to monitor network traffic and
determine the number and types of hosts (including network devices) on your
network, as well as the operating systems, active applications, and open ports
on those hosts. You can also configure managed devices to monitor user activity
on your network. You can use discovery data to perform traffic profiling,
assess network compliance, and respond to policy violations.

In a basic deployment (discovery and simple, network-based
access control only), you can improve a device’s performance by following a few
important guidelines when configuring its access control policy.

| **Note** | ---   You must use an access control policy, even if it simply allows all traffic. The network discovery policy can **only** examine traffic that the access control policy allows to pass.   --- |
| --- | --- |

First, make sure your access control policy does not require
complex processing and uses only simple, network-based criteria to handle
network traffic. You must implement
**all** of the following guidelines; misconfiguring any one of
these options eliminates the performance benefit:

* Do **not** use the Security Intelligence feature. Remove any populated global Block or Do Not Block list from the policy’s Security
  Intelligence configuration.
* Do
  **not** include access control rules with Monitor or Interactive
  Block actions. Use only Allow, Trust, and Block rules. Keep in mind that
  allowed traffic can be inspected by discovery; trusted and blocked traffic
  cannot.
* Do
  **not** include access control rules with application, user,
  URL, ISE attribute, or geolocation-based network conditions. Use only simple
  network-based conditions: zone, IP address, VLAN tag, and port.
* Do
  **not** include access control rules that perform file, malware,
  or intrusion inspection. In other words, do not associate a file policy or
  intrusion policy with any access control rule.
* In the Advanced settings for the access control policy, make sure that Intrusion Policy used before Access Control rule is determined is set to No Rules Active.
* Select
  Network Discovery Only as the policy’s default
  action. Do
  **not** choose a default action for the policy that performs
  intrusion inspection.

In conjunction with the access control policy, you can configure
and deploy the network discovery policy, which specifies the network segments,
ports, and zones that the system examines for discovery data, as well as
whether hosts, applications, and users are discovered on the segments, ports,
and zones.

**Related Concepts**
[Inspection of Packets That Pass Before Traffic Is Identified](advanced_access_control_settings_for_network_analysis_and_intrusion_policies.html#ID-2194-0000001f)

### Intrusion Prevention Without Discovery

Disabling discovery if you don't need it (for example, in an IPS-only deployment) can improve performance. To disable discovery
you must implement *all* of these changes:

* Delete *all* rules from your network discovery policy.
* Use *only* simple network-based conditions to perform access control: zone, IP address, VLAN tag, and port.

  Do *not* perform any kind of Security Intelligence, application, user, URL, or geolocation control. Although you can disable storage of discovery data, the system still must
  collect and examine it to implement those features.
* Disable network and URL-based Security Intelligence by deleting *all* Block and Do Not Block lists from your access control policy's Security Intelligence configuration, including the default
  Global lists.
* Disable DNS-based Security Intelligence by deleting or disabling *all* rules in the associated DNS policy, including the default Global Do-Not-Block List for DNS and Global Block List for DNS
  rules.

After you deploy, new discovery halts on target devices. The system gradually deletes information in the network map according
to your timeout preferences. Or, you can purge all discovery data immediately.

## History for Policy Management

| **Feature** | **Version** | **Details** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rollback deployment on an FTD device | 6.7 | Rollback is a deployment functionality provided to remove the existing deployment on an FTD device and to reconfigure the device with the previously deployed configuration.  New/modified pages: The Deploy > Deployment History page provides a new Rollback column with the rollback icons. Similar rollback icons can also be found when the jobs are expanded, to initiate rollback at the device level.  Supported platforms: Firepower Management Center |
| Revamp of the deploy section in the Firepower Management Center. | 6.6 | The Deploy button on the FMC menu bar is changed to Deploy menu. There are two new sub-menu options under it. These are Deployment and Deployment History. The Deployment page has undergone an improvement along with newly added features, and the new Deployment History page provides a legend of all the previous deployments.  The Deployment page has the following newly added features:   * Deployment status: On the Deployment page, the   Status column provides the deployment status for   each device. * Deployment estimate: The   Estimate link is available   on the Deployment page after you select a device,   a policy, or a configuration. The   Estimate link provides an   estimate of the deployment duration once   clicked. * Deployment preview: Preview provides a snapshot   of all the policy and object changes to be   deployed on the device. The policy changes include   the new policies, changes in the existing   policies, and the deleted policies. The object   changes include the added and modified objects   which are used in policies. * Selective policy deployment: FMC allows you to   select a specific policy within the list of all   the changes on the device that are due for   deployment and deploy only the selected   policy.   Supported platforms: Firepower Management Center |

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

# **Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Compatibility**

This document lists the Secure Firewall ASA software and
hardware compatibility and requirements.

## ASA and ASDM Compatibility Per Model

This section lists ASA and ASDM compatibility per model.

| **Note** | ---   For guidance on security issues on the ASA, and which releases contain fixes for each issue, see the [ASA Security Advisories](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### ASA 9.22

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.22(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.20 with ASA 9.22. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.22(1.2) with ASDM 7.22(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Table 1. ASA and ASDM Compatibility: 9.22

| ASA | ASDM | ASA Model | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **9.22(1.1)** | 7.22(1) | **YES** | **YES** | **YES** | **YES** | **YES** | **YES** | **YES** | **YES** |

### ASA 9.20 and 9.19

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASA 9.18(x) was the final version for the Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150, and   Security Modules SM-24, SM-36, and SM-44 for the Firepower 9300. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.19(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). See the following   exceptions:    + For the Firepower 1010E, ASDM 7.19(1) is not supported. You must use 7.19(1.90)+     or 7.18(2.1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.18 with ASA 9.19. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.20(1.5) with ASDM 7.20(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |

### ASA 9.18 to 9.17

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.17(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). See the following   exceptions:    + For the Firepower 1010E, ASDM 7.19(1) is not supported. You must use 7.19(1.90)+     or 7.18(2.1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.17 with ASA 9.18. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.17(1.2) with ASDM 7.17(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.17(1.13) and 9.18(2) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now   validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run   an older ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be   blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”   will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291),   [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))  --- |

### ASA 9.16 to 9.15

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASA 9.14(x) was the final version for the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.15(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.15 with ASA 9.16. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.16(1.15) with ASDM 7.16(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.16(3.19) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older   ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked   and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be   displayed at the ASA CLI.

### ASA 9.14 to 9.13

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.14(x) was the final version for the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X. * ASA 9.12(x) was the final version for the ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.13(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA 9.10(1).   ASDM 7.13(1) and ASDM 7.14(1) did not support ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM;   you must upgrade to ASDM 7.13(1.101) or 7.14(1.48) to restore ASDM support. * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.13 with ASA 9.14. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.14(1.2) with ASDM 7.14(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.14(4.14) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older   ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked   and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be   displayed at the ASA CLI.

### ASA 9.12 to 9.5

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.12(x) was the final version for the ASA   5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all   previous ASA versions, unless otherwise stated.   For example, ASDM 7.12(1) can manage an ASA 5515-X   on ASA 9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM   version or a later version; you cannot use an old   version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For   example, you cannot use ASDM 7.10 with ASA 9.12.   For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can   continue to use the current ASDM version, unless   otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.12(1.15) with ASDM 7.12(1). If an ASA   maintenance release has significant new features,   then usually there will be a new ASDM version   required. * ASA 9.8(4.45) and 9.12(4.50) and later require   ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed   image. If you try to run an older ASDM image than   7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix,   ASDM will be blocked and the message “%ERROR:   Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”   will be displayed at the ASA CLI.

## **ASA and VPN Compatibility**

For ASA and VPN compatibility, see [Supported VPN Platforms, Cisco ASA 5500 Series](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asa-vpn-compatibility.html).

## Firepower 4100/9300 Compatibility with ASA and Threat Defense

For the Firepower 4100/9300, you must maintain compatibility between FXOS and all ASA and
threat
defense logical devices. Upgrade FXOS before you upgrade the sofware. The **bold** versions
the the following table are specially-qualified (enhanced testing) companion releases. Use
these combinations whenever
possible.

Note that for other device models, the FXOS compatibility work is done for you. In most
cases, upgrading the software automatically upgrades
FXOS.
For the Secure Firewall 3100/4200 in multi-instance mode, the management center guides you through upgrading FXOS and then threat
defense.

To upgrade:

* FXOS: From FXOS 2.2.2 and later, you can upgrade directly to
  any higher version. When upgrading from versions earlier than 2.2.2, you need to
  upgrade to each intermediate version. Note that you cannot upgrade FXOS to a version
  that does not support your current logical device version. You will need to upgrade in
  steps: upgrade FXOS to the highest version that supports your current logical device;
  then upgrade your logical device to the highest version supported with that FXOS
  version. For example, if you want to upgrade from FXOS 2.2/ASA 9.8 to FXOS 2.13/ASA
  9.19, you would have to perform the following upgrades:

  1. FXOS 2.2→FXOS 2.11 (the highest version that supports 9.8)
  2. ASA 9.8→ASA 9.17 (the highest version supported by 2.11)
  3. FXOS 2.11→FXOS 2.13
  4. ASA 9.17→ASA 9.19
* Threat Defense: Interim upgrades may be required for threat
  defense, in addition to the FXOS requirements above. For the exact upgrade path, refer to the
  [management center upgrade guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-installation-guides-list.html) for your version.
* ASA: ASA lets you upgrade directly from your current version to any higher version,
  noting the FXOS requirements above.

| **Note** | ---   FXOS 2.8(1.125)+ and later versions do not support ASA 9.14(1) or 9.14(1.10) for ASA SNMP polls and traps; you must use 9.14(1.15)+. Other releases, such as 9.13 or 9.12, are not affected.   --- |

## Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) Compatibility with the ASA

CDO can manage all platforms running ASA 8.4 and later (see [ASA and ASDM Compatibility Per Model](#id_65776)), except for the ASA Services Module (ASASM), which is not
supported by CDO.

CDO can onboard an ASA running ASA 8.3 but cannot deploy changes to it or manage it
in any other way. Support is "read-only."

CDO does not support management of the ASA FirePOWER module, which runs a different
operating system from ASA. You can still use the ASA FirePOWER module in your
system, but you need to manage it separately with Firepower Management Center or
ASDM.

There may be a CDO feature that does not support all versions of ASA, such as ASA
upgrades from pre-9.12 versions. In those cases, the CDO documentation will list any
version exceptions with the prerequisites for that feature.

## ASA REST API Compatibility

This section lists ASA REST API and ASA compatibility.

| **Note** | ---   The REST API is not supported on newer hardware models and is no longer being developed. We recommend that you instead use the ASA HTTP interface for automation. See [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA HTTP Interface for Automation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/misc/http-interface/asa-http-interface.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

The ASA REST API is supported only on the following models starting with 9.3(2) and
ending with 9.16:

* ASA
  Virtual
* Firepower 9300
* ISA 3000
* Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150
* ASA 5585-X
* ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, 5555-X
* ASA 5512-X, 5515-X
* ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, 5516-X

  | **Note** | ---   The ASA 5506-X series does not support the REST API if you are running the FirePOWER module Version 6.0 or later. Disable the ASA REST API using the **no rest-api agent** command.   --- |

## Firepower 2100 Network Module Compatibility

| **Note** | ---   If a network module is listed for multiple Firepower models, and the part number only differs in the model number (FPR*X*K-NM-*module*), then that module is compatible with the other Firepower models. For example, the FPR9K-NM-6X10SR-F module is compatible on the Firepower 2100 (FPR2K-NM-6X10SR-F) and Firepower 4100 (FPR4K-NM-6X10SR-F). See the [FXOS compatibility guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/compatibility/fxos-compatibility.html) for information about Firepower 4100 and 9300 network modules.   --- |

## ASA and Threat Defense Clustering External Hardware Support

Clustering will work with both Cisco and non-Cisco switches from other major
switching vendors with no known interoperability issues if they comply with the
following requirements and recommendations. Clustering is compatible with
technologies such as vPC (Nexus), VSS (Catalyst), and StackWise & StackWise
Virtual (Catalyst).

### Switch Requirements

* All third party switches must be compliant to the IEEE standard (802.3ad) Link Aggregation Control Protocol.
* EtherChannel bundling must be completed within 45 seconds when connected to Firepower devices and 33 seconds when connected
  to ASA devices.
* On the cluster control link, the switch must provide fully unimpeded unicast and broadcast connectivity at Layer 2 between
  all cluster members.
* On the cluster control link, the switch must not impose any limitations on IP addressing or the packet format above Layer
  2 headers.
* On the cluster control link, the switch interfaces must support jumbo frames and be configurable for an MTU above 1600.

### Switch Recommendations

* The switch should provide uniform traffic distribution over the EtherChannel's individual links.
* The switch should have an EtherChannel load-balancing algorithm that provides traffic symmetry.
* The EtherChannel load balance hash algorithm should be configurable using the 5-tuple, 4-tuple, or 2-tuple to calculate the
  hash.

| **Note** | ---   For the Firepower 9300 cluster, intra-chassis clustering can operate with any switch because Firepower 9300-to-switch connections use standard interface types.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Some switches, such as the Nexus series, do not support LACP rate fast when performing in-service software upgrades (ISSUs), so we do not recommend using ISSUs with clustering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## **ASA and Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Compatibility**

The platforms supported include:

* ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X (8.6(x)—9.14(x))
* ASA 5512-X, 5515-X (8.6(x)—9.12(x))
* ASA 5585-X (8.4(x)—9.12(x))
