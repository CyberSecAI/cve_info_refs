Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A logic error in the client forwarding code of Cisco Access Points (APs).
- The AP forwards packets destined for a wireless client if they are received on the native VLAN, even if the client resides on a non-native VLAN.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of VLAN tagging and packet forwarding within the AP's software.
- Lack of proper VLAN separation enforcement when forwarding packets to wireless clients.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass VLAN separation, allowing them to send traffic from the native VLAN to clients on different VLANs.
- The attacker could potentially bypass Layer 3 protection mechanisms that rely on VLAN separation.
- Unauthorized access and potentially data interception or manipulation of devices on non-native VLANs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Adjacent attacker: An attacker needs to be within the network's broadcast domain to gain access to the native VLAN.
- Packet injection: The attacker must be able to inject traffic into the native VLAN of the affected AP.
- Targeting specific wireless clients: The attacker directs traffic by specifying the MAC/IP address of the target wireless client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have access to the native VLAN of the affected Cisco AP.
- The attacker does not need any authentication to perform the attack.
- The attacker needs to be capable of injecting packets onto the network.
- The attacker needs to know the MAC/IP of the intended target on a non-native VLAN.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected Products: Multiple Cisco Aironet Series Access Points running vulnerable software, including:
  - 6300 Series Embedded Services Access Points (ESW6300)
