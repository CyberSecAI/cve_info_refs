{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The io_uring subsystem incorrectly uses the current task context instead of the original task context when handling requests, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect task context usage",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Local escalation of privilege.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local application that interacts with the io_uring subsystem with IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL enabled and multiple tasks doing submissions.",
    "required_capabilities": "System execution privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.",
     "details": "If the ring is setup with IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL and we have more than one task doing submissions on a ring, we can end up in a situation where we assign the context from the current task rather than the request originator. Always use req->task rather than assume it's the same as current. No upstream patch exists for this issue, as only older kernels with the non-native workers have this problem."
