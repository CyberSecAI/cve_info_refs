```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `resetIkeState()` function can trigger `interfaceRemoved()` which clears `mInterface`. If `mInterface` is not cleared before `interfaceRemoved()` is called in `onDefaultNetworkChanged()`, then the VPN may not disconnect properly when switching from mobile data to Wi-Fi.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper handling of network interface changes leading to a race condition.",
    "The VPN interface is not cleared correctly before a network change event, which can lead to the VPN not disconnecting as expected."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The device may remain connected to the VPN even when the user switches to a different network (e.g., from mobile data to Wi-Fi). This can lead to unexpected data usage, privacy issues, or other security concerns.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered when a device establishes a VPN connection with mobile data and then switches to Wi-Fi.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No special attacker capabilities are required; the vulnerability can be triggered by a regular user switching between mobile data and Wi-Fi while using a VPN."
