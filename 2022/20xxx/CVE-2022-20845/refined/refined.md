{
  "CVE-2022-20845": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the TL1 function of Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 4000 Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a memory leak in the TL1 process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists because the TL1 feature does not properly free memory under specific conditions.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory Leak",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending TL1 commands after being authenticated, which can cause the TL1 process to consume large amounts of memory. When memory consumption reaches a threshold, the Resource Monitor (Resmon) process will restart or shutdown the top five memory consumers, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the device to connect to it and issue TL1 commands."
