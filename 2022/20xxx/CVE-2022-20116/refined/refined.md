Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the usage of `#getIntent()` within the `OngoingCallController`. This method can be exploited to bypass security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper use of `#getIntent()` in the `OngoingCallController`.
- Potential for unauthorized access/manipulation of intent data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a local escalation of privilege.
- Specifically, it could allow the attacker to bypass security checks and interact with activities they shouldn't have access to.
-  It is stated that clicking on a chip would still open valid activities, so the severity is tied to privilege escalation (EoP)

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is local. An attacker with user-level access can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating intents.
-  The specific method of exploitation revolves around the misuse of `getIntent()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to have user-level execution privileges on the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious intents to take advantage of the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves avoiding calling `#getIntent()` to prevent the security vulnerability, indicating a flawed process within how intents are being handled in the `OngoingCallController`
- The provided commit message indicates that this fix was cherry-picked from multiple commits: `08d94cbabb44207f1ebfddc76d9f11b6b328fdee`, `b029b005d8d4122d29cffc86b752fce13b1d4da6`, and `ccac141cc774a76a2aaef76399fa6790252363cf`, which provides more context around the nature of this fix
