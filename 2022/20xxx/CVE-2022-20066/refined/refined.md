**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is local, and no user interaction is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the device.
- The attacker requires System execution privileges in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- MT6580, MT6739, MT6761, MT6765, MT6769, MT6771, MT6785, MT6833, MT6873, MT6875, MT6877, MT6891, MT8168, MT8365, MT8666, MT8667, MT8696, MT8766, MT8768, MT8788

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 11.0, 12.0

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-20066 details an information disclosure vulnerability found in the atf (hwfde) component of certain MediaTek chipsets. Incorrect error handling can lead to leakage of sensitive information. The vulnerability can be exploited locally by an attacker with system privileges.
