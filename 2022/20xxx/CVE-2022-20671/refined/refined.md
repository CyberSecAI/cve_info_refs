Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20671:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content includes a Cisco Security Advisory titled "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities" which lists CVE-2022-20671 as one of the affected CVEs. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is "insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface" of the Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) software.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker does not require prior authentication.
    - The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious link and persuade a user to click it.
    - The attacker needs to target a user of the vulnerable CSPC web interface.
