    - Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers.
    - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper input validation leading to potential buffer overflows (CWE-120) and command injection (CWE-77).
    - Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution with root-level privileges or a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to device restart.
    - Attack vectors: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface.
    - Required attacker capabilities/position: Authenticated attacker with valid administrator credentials on the affected device. The attacker can be either on the LAN or WAN side if remote management is enabled.
