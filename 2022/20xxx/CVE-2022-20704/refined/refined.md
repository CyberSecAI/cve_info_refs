  "CVE-2022-20704": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the software upgrade module of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view or alter information that is shared between an affected device and specific Cisco servers (cloudsso.cisco.com and api.cisco.com). This vulnerability is due to improper validation of the SSL server certificate that is received when establishing a connection to specific remote servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and the server, and then using a forged certificate to impersonate the server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force the affected device to download arbitrary software images and launch further attacks, combining other vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.",
