The advisory also includes links to related documentation and the Cisco software download page. Specifically, the advisory states:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Logic error in the BFD rate limiter functionality.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Crafted stream of traffic can cause BFD traffic to be dropped, resulting in BFD session flaps and denial of service.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit causes BFD session flaps, leading to route instability, dropped traffic, and denial of service.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of traffic through the device. Applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\n*    **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to send traffic through the affected device that has the BFD feature enabled and at least one active BFD session.\nThis advisory has been marked final.",
