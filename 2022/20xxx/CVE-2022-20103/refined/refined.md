- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the aee daemon not properly handling symbolic links, potentially leading to it following a malicious symlink.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a symlink following issue (CWE-61) in the aee daemon.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploitation can lead to local information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to manipulate symbolic links which the aee daemon could follow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device. The attacker would also need system execution privileges. The attacker does not need any user interaction.
