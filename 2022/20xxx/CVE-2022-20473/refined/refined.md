{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the ICU library handles string sizes when registering locale lists. When the buffer size equals the string size, a warning `U_STRING_NOT_TERMINATED_WARNING` (a negative number) is returned, and the error check only fails if the error number is greater than zero. This results in a non-null-terminated string being passed to subsequent functions, leading to crashes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of string termination",
      "Insufficient error checking for negative return values"
    ],
    "impact": "Passing non-null-terminated strings can cause different types of crashes in subsequent functions.",
     "attack_vectors": "The specific attack vector isn't provided in detail, but it stems from providing a locale list that triggers this edge case within the ICU library.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have some level of control over the locale list used by the system."
