Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20612:

**CVE-2022-20612**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Jenkins core not requiring POST requests for the HTTP endpoint that handles manual build requests when no security realm is set.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of POST request enforcement allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated Jenkins user, can trigger unintended actions on the Jenkins server.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can trigger the build of a job without parameters.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to entice a Jenkins user to visit a malicious website or open a crafted HTML document that initiates the build request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to Jenkins; however they require a logged-in victim to visit their malicious link or HTML file. The attacker has to be able to convince or coerce the victim to visit the malicious link.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The Jenkins core functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. In Jenkins versions 2.329 and earlier, and LTS 2.319.1 and earlier, the manual build request endpoint fails to check for a valid POST request if there is no configured security realm. This allows an attacker to craft an HTTP request to the Jenkins server. If a user visits the attacker's web page while authenticated to Jenkins, the attack will succeed without the user having to confirm or approve it.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger builds of jobs that do not require build parameters.
