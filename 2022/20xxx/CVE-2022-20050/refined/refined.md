Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20050:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to improper link resolution in `connsyslogger`, which allows for symbolic link (symlink) following.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following:** The `connsyslogger` service does not properly handle symlinks, allowing an attacker to potentially redirect file operations to unintended locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges, specifically System execution privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device.
- **Symlink manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate symbolic links to cause `connsyslogger` to write to arbitrary locations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the device.
- System execution privileges are needed to perform the exploitation.
- No user interaction is needed for exploitation.

**Affected Chipsets:**
The following MediaTek chipsets are affected:
MT6762, MT6765, MT6768, MT6769, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6795, MT6797, MT6799, MT6833, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6873, MT6875, MT6877, MT6880, MT6883, MT6885, MT6889, MT6891, MT6893, MT8163, MT8167, MT8167S, MT8168, MT8173, MT8175, MT8183, MT8185, MT8321, MT8362A, MT8365, MT8385, MT8666, MT8667, MT8675, MT8696, MT8735A, MT8735B, MT8765, MT8766, MT8768, MT8786, MT8788, MT8789, MT8791, MT8797

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 11.0, 12.0
