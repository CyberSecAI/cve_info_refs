The provided content is a security bulletin from MediaTek, which includes details for CVE-2022-20052.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the mdp (Media Display Processor) component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption caused by using freed memory. Specifically, a use-after-free (UAF) condition is present, which can occur when a program attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain higher privileges on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning that the attacker must already have some level of access to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires system execution privileges to exploit this vulnerability, and user interaction is necessary for exploitation.

**Affected chipsets:**
MT6580, MT6735, MT6737, MT6739, MT6750, MT6753, MT6755, MT6762, MT6763, MT6765, MT6768, MT6769, MT6771, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6833, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6873, MT6877, MT6885, MT6890, MT6891, MT6893, MT8163, MT8167, MT8167S, MT8168, MT8173, MT8175, MT8183, MT8321, MT8362A, MT8365, MT8385, MT8666, MT8667, MT8735A, MT8735B, MT8765, MT8766, MT8768, MT8786, MT8788.
