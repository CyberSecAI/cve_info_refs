Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that masked secret values within webhook URLs are not cleared when the webhook's target URL is modified. This allows a malicious or unauthorized user to potentially extract these secrets by changing the URL to a server they control, even though the secrets are masked in the UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Secret Exposure:** Masked secrets in webhooks are not invalidated when the target URL is changed, making them accessible to attackers by redirecting the webhook.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** Unlike other token fields in webhooks and integrations that are reset when the URL is changed, masked webhook URL secrets persist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A maintainer (or other authorized user) with the ability to modify webhook URLs can potentially leak the masked secrets to attacker-controlled servers.
- **Spoofing:** The leaked token enables the attacker to potentially spoof requests to the original intended receiving service.
- **Compromised Receiving Service:** The receiving service (the target of the webhook) can be impacted by a malicious user who has obtained the leaked secrets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Webhook URL Modification:** The attacker modifies the webhook's target URL to an attacker controlled server and triggers a test request or regular webhook trigger.
- **Maintainer Role Abuse:** An attacker with "Maintainer" role in the GitLab project can change the URL of webhook.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Maintainer Access:** The attacker must have at least Maintainer access to the GitLab project where the webhook is configured.
- **Ability to Modify Webhooks:** The attacker needs the permission to modify webhook settings.
- **Server to Receive Leaked Secrets:**  The attacker needs an attacker-controlled server (e.g., webhook.site) to receive the webhook requests containing the leaked secrets.

**Additional Details (from Content):**
- The issue was initially reported as HackerOne report #1791331 by user joaxcar.
- The vulnerability is related to a feature introduced in GitLab 15.6, which allows masking parts of webhook URLs as secret values.
- The masked values are meant to be encrypted at rest and not accessible after initial configuration, even to the user who configured it.
- The expected behavior is that changing the domain/origin of the webhook URL should invalidate the secrets, similar to how it works for other secrets in GitLab.
