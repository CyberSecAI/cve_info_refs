- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI), CWE-89
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges, such as an administrator, can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible via the `wp-admin/admin.php` page, specifically when the `page` parameter is set to `wsysadmin_publishers`, the `action` parameter is set to `delete`, and the `id` parameter is manipulated to inject SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges within the WordPress system, such as administrator privileges.
