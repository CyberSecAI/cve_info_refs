The provided content is related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability fix in the `dash-live` repository.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from extracting text from a DOM node and directly interpreting it as HTML, which allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code if the extracted text contains malicious script tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Specifically, the vulnerability is a reflected XSS, as the malicious payload is injected via user-controlled input (filenames and kids) into the HTML context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser by injecting malicious script tags into the `filename` or `kids` variables of a media file.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, phishing attacks, defacement, and other unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker can manipulate the `filename` or `kids` metadata values associated with a media file. When the application processes and displays this data, it does not properly sanitize it, resulting in the injection of malicious scripts.
-  Specifically, the vulnerable code is in `static/js/media.js`, where the `filename` and `result.representation.kids` are displayed within HTML elements without proper escaping.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would require the ability to manipulate the media file metadata, specifically the filename and the 'kids' field. This could be achieved through various methods depending on how the media files are handled in the application and what upload/modification functionalities are exposed.
-  The attacker would also require knowledge of how the affected web application processes the media files and displays their information on the user's browser.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by encoding the `filename` and `kids` values using `encodeURIComponent()` before using them in HTML tags, preventing the browser from interpreting any injected HTML tags as code.
