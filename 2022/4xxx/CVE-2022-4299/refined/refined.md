- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Metricool plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (like an admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, which will then execute when other users access the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker exploits the plugin's settings page by inserting a malicious payload in the 'Blog or website identifier' field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative or other high-privilege access to the WordPress dashboard.
