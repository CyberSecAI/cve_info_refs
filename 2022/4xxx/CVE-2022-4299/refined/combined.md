## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Metricool < 1.18 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. In the settings page of the plugin, add the payload under Blog or website identifier: '})});alert('XSS')//
2. Open the site on the browser to get the XSS trigger.
