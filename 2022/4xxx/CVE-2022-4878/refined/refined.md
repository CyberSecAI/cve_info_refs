**Vulnerability:** Path Traversal

**Root Cause:** The `ZipUtil.unzip` method in `modules/common/app/utils/common/ZipUtil.java` was vulnerable to path traversal attacks when extracting zip files. This vulnerability stems from the fact that the destination directory was not normalized before extracting the contents of the zip file. A malicious zip file containing entries with path components like `../` could cause files to be extracted outside of the intended destination directory.

**Weakness:**  Lack of proper input sanitization. Specifically, the destination path was not normalized, allowing for relative path components within the zip archive to manipulate the extraction location.

**Impact:**
An attacker could overwrite or create files in arbitrary locations on the server by crafting a malicious zip file. This could potentially lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical system files
    - Data exfiltration by writing sensitive information to accessible locations
    - Denial of service by overwriting crucial files

**Attack Vector:**
The attack vector is a malicious zip file provided to the vulnerable `unzip` function.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted zip file that the application will attempt to unzip. The attacker would need a position where they can provide input to the vulnerable method.
