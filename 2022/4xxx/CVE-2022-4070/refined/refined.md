Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit `ce8e5f3d056829bfa7a845f9dc2757e21e419ddc`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that disabled users could still log in via cookie-based authentication. This allowed disabled accounts to bypass the intended access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Session Handling:** The application was not properly checking the user's enabled status during session authentication via cookies.
*   **Bypass of Authorization Checks:** Disabled user accounts were not effectively blocked from accessing the application after logging in via cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Disabled users could regain access to the application despite having their accounts explicitly deactivated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cookie Replay:** An attacker with a valid session cookie for a disabled user could potentially bypass authentication controls.
*   **Direct Login by Disabled User:** A disabled user who still had a valid session cookie would be able to use it to log back into the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Prior Access:** The attacker must have previously had a valid, enabled user account on the system in order to obtain the valid session cookie.
*   **Persistence of Session Cookie:** The attacker needs the session cookie to still be active or available in the browser after the account has been disabled.

**Technical Details:**

The commit `ce8e5f3d056829bfa7a845f9dc2757e21e419ddc` addresses this issue by:

1.  **Adding `VerifyUserEnabled` middleware:** This new middleware checks if the currently logged-in user is enabled. If the user is disabled, the middleware will invalidate the session and redirect the user to the login page with an error message.

    ```php
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
      if (Auth::check() && ! Auth::user()->enabled) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
        $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    
        return redirect()->route('login')->withErrors(['msg' => __('auth.disabled')]);
      }
    
      return $next($request);
    }
    ```

2.  **Registering the middleware:** The `VerifyUserEnabled` middleware was added to the application's HTTP kernel to be run for all web requests.

    ```php
    'middleware' => [
      ...
      \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyUserEnabled::class,
      ...
    ],
    ```

3.  **Adding an error message:** A new error message was added to the `auth.php` language file to show the user if their account has been disabled.
    ```php
    'disabled' => 'Your Account is disabled, please contact Admin.',
    ```
4.  **Displaying an error message:** The error message is displayed on the login screen using `toastr.error('{{ $errors->first() }}')`.

In summary, the commit fixes a security vulnerability where disabled users could still log in via their session cookies by adding middleware that checks for user status and terminates the session if the user is disabled. This ensures that disabled accounts are effectively blocked from accessing the application.
