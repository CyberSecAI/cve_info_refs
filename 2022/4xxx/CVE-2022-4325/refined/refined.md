- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which can be executed by a logged-in high-privilege user (such as an admin). This can lead to various malicious activities, like session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a malicious script in the `controller` parameter of the `options-general.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in high-privilege user into opening the crafted URL.
