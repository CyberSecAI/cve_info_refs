## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Quizlord <= 2.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Quizlord » Add a quiz
2. In the input field 'Title', add the payload - "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
3. Click the Save button to see the XSS alert.

### Affects Plugins
