- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-provided input in its settings, specifically in the "Name" field of the warehouse configuration within the WooCommerce > Settings > DPD > Warehouses section.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of sanitization allows malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users accessing the WordPress backend. This can lead to various malicious activities including session hijacking, defacement, or other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious payload in the "Name" field of the warehouse settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high privileges such as an administrator role in the WordPress instance to access and modify the plugin's settings.
