## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Attachments < 5.0.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "List Head" or "Date Format" settings of the plugin and save: "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
