## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Font Awesome < 4.3.2 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escapes some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged-in admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[icon name='circle-exclamation' title='" onmouseover="alert(1)']

### Affects Plugins
