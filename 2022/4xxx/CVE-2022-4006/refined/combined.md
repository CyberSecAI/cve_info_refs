| Hi team,  I found a way to bypass account protection (not blocked when brute-force account).  Step: \*this is demo some cases   1. If I log in wrongly too many times, it will be locked    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70020521/200104280-6124bd02-b0e1-457e-9797-aa721b421da5.png) 2. But i can pass it by insert X-Forwarded-For header, then brute-force without being locked (use intruder plugin of burp suite)    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70020521/200104617-cd1fb003-9cbf-432f-80df-da38d92c914d.png) 3. set payload to brute-force and start attack    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70020521/200104745-c4f30bc2-bf80-4c00-a8d8-cac5d73cf65b.png)    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70020521/200104753-87d90ff6-4a0b-4f5e-962f-b5f32b9187ae.png) 4.
