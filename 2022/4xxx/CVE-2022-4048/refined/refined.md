- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS boot application encryption, when using the CODESYS Runtime Key or Wibu-System CodeMeter dongle/flash card, employs weak cryptography.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326). The encryption method used for the boot application is susceptible to decryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can decrypt the boot application, gaining access to and enabling manipulation of the compiled code.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can target the encrypted boot application file that is downloaded to and executed by CODESYS Control runtime systems.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs medium skills to exploit this vulnerability. They need access to the vulnerable encrypted boot application file.
