{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository and primarily focuses on changes related to access control. It modifies several files, mostly in the `api` and `server` directories, to remove the `json` tag from the `CreatorID`, `UserID`, and `MemoID` fields in various structs. This change seems to be aimed at preventing these fields from being serialized in JSON responses, likely for security reasons related to access control. The changes also include minor fixes related to user sign up.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inappropriate exposure of sensitive user IDs and memo IDs through JSON serialization.",
      "Minor inconsistencies in error messages related to user signup"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of the removed JSON tags would be to prevent exposure of internal creator/user/memo ids in API responses. The vulnerability this change remediates is likely an information exposure vulnerability where internal object identifiers were being unintentionally exposed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Attacker would need access to API responses of the server"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to make API requests to the server and observe responses."
    ]
