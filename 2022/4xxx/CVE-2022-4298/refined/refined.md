Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The plugin lacks authorization checks and proper input validation when generating file paths. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path used for file downloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to download arbitrary files from the server without authentication.
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability exploits the lack of input sanitization which allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../`) to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files (e.g., `wp-config.php`), potentially revealing database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.
*   **Full system compromise:** depending on the files accessible, an attacker may be able to use leaked credentials to further compromise the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint: `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `ced_cwsm_log_download` parameter within the request to specify the path of the file they wish to download using path traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site, making this a highly accessible vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know the parameter used to trigger the arbitrary file download vulnerability (`ced_cwsm_log_download`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the "Wholesale Market" plugin prior to 2.2.1.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability to download the `wp-config.php` file.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-552 which relates to "Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", and is considered an Injection vulnerability as defined by OWASP.
