- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities, including against high-privileged users.
- **Attack vectors:** By using a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript within one of its attributes. For example: `[ss id='" onmouseover="alert(1)'].`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have Contributor or higher level privileges to create and modify content where the shortcode is used.
