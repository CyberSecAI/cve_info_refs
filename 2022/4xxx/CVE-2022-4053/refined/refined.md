The provided content discusses a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Student Attendance Management System.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new class name. Specifically, HTML special characters are not encoded which allows JavaScript code to be stored in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** When a user views the class list, the stored JavaScript code will be executed in their browser. An attacker could potentially perform a variety of malicious actions, including stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or modifying displayed content.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "create class" functionality in the admin panel. The attacker provides malicious JavaScript as the class name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin user with the ability to manage classes.
