Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The BookingPress plugin uses the `appointment_id` query parameter on its "thank you" page to display booking information, without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses the `appointment_id` from the URL without verifying if the user is authorized to access the associated booking data. This allows an attacker to access any booking data by simply changing the `appointment_id`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can access sensitive booking details, including:
    *   Full name of the customer
    *   Date and time of the appointment
    *   Service booked

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with an arbitrary `appointment_id` in the query string.
*   The base64 encoded `appointment_id` could also be manipulated by a malicious actor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or login credentials.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate URL query parameters.
*   **Access to the target website:** The attacker needs to access the website hosting the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in BookingPress versions prior to 1.0.31.
*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP A5: Broken Access Control and CWE-639.
*   The CVSS score is 7.5 (High), indicating a significant risk.
