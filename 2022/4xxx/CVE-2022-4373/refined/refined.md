- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (such as an admin user) can inject malicious SQL queries into the application, potentially leading to data exfiltration or modification, and unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the `sortby` parameter in the `edit.php` page of the WordPress admin panel (`/wp-admin/edit.php?page=quote-o-matic.php`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
