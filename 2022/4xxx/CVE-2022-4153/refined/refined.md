- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize the `upload[]` POST parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leak sensitive information from the site's database.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least author privileges on the WordPress site.
