## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Image Hover Effects < 5.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Go to the plugin settings (Image Hover Effects > Image Hover Effects) and put the following payload in any input field (such as Category Name, Caption Description, Caption Heading, etc.) and save: "><img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the settings again, as well as in posts/pages where the caption is embedded via shortcode.
