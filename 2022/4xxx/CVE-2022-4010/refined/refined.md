- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. The XSS will be triggered when accessing the settings again, as well as in posts/pages where the caption is embedded via shortcode.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings fields such as Category Name, Caption Description, and Caption Heading.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as admin, to access and modify the plugin settings.
