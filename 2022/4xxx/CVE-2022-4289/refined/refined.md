Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4289:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input masking for sensitive Google IAP credentials used in the Prometheus integration within GitLab. Unlike other integrations that mask tokens and passwords, the Google IAP credentials (private key, client email, etc.) are displayed in plain text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Sensitive information exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the direct exposure of Google IAP credentials, including private keys.
- **Missing input masking:**  The Prometheus integration lacks proper masking of sensitive input fields.
- **Access control bypass:** The issue allows any user within a project to view instance-wide Prometheus integration credentials when they should be restricted to administrator view only.
- **Configuration leakage:** Changing to "custom settings" or modifying the URL of the Prometheus integration does not clear or mask the sensitive fields.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive data disclosure:** Attackers can obtain Google IAP credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to Google Cloud resources.
- **Lateral movement:** Compromised credentials could be leveraged to access other systems or data accessible through the compromised IAP service account.
- **Instance-wide compromise:** When an administrator configures an instance-wide Prometheus integration, the IAP credentials are exposed to *all* users across *all* projects on the GitLab instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web interface exploitation:** The vulnerability is exposed through the GitLab web interface. An attacker can navigate to the Prometheus integration settings page.
- **Configuration review:** An attacker can obtain credentials by reviewing the integration settings.
- **Credential reuse:** An attacker can copy and reuse exposed credentials, even after changing to "custom settings."

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **GitLab user account:** The attacker needs to have a GitLab user account.
- **Project access:** The attacker needs to be a maintainer of at least one project to access the project's Prometheus integration settings.
- **Instance access:** The attacker needs to be a user on a GitLab instance where the Prometheus integration was configured with IAP credentials, and where the vulnerable GitLab version is running.

**Summary of vulnerability:**
GitLab versions 15.3 prior to 15.7.8, 15.8 prior to 15.8.4, and 15.9 prior to 15.9.2 have a vulnerability in their Prometheus integration settings. The Google IAP credentials used for authentication are not masked, which enables any user with access to the integration configuration to view them. This applies to credentials configured at the project, group, or instance level and can lead to unauthorized access to other systems and data through the compromised IAP service account.

**Additional Notes:**
- NetApp products are affected due to the inclusion of the vulnerable GitLab component within their solutions.
- NetApp has not yet released patches for the vulnerability within their products and lists several of their products as *not affected*.
