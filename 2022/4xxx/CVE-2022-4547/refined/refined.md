- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the database, and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the `orderby` parameter in the `wcpma_view_list` action within the WordPress admin interface. The vulnerable URL is: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wcpma-payment-settings&action=wcpma_view_list&orderby=1+AND+(SELECT+7394+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))UrUZ)`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high privilege user, such as an administrator, or any user with the `admin` role, to exploit the vulnerability.
