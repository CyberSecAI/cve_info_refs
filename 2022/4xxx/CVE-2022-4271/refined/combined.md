This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

security: Username XSS

```
This mitigates a vulnerability reported by legoclones on
[huntr.dev](<https://huntr.dev/>) where XSS can be stored/executed via a
User's `username`. If an Agent is redirected to the User Lookup AJAX
response directly it will execute the stored XSS. This adds
`Format::sanitize()` to the `username` before saving to the database so any
potential XSS is sanitized. Additionally, this adds `Format::htmlchars()` to
the `username` before displaying in the UI to help prevent code execution.
