The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4588.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code was vulnerable to XSS because the title was not properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML. The `html_safe` method was being used improperly in the title tag.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the title, which would then be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker would need to control or inject malicious content into `@title`, `@subject.try(:subject_code_was)`, `@project.try(:name)`, or `ENV["website_name"]` that would be rendered in the title of the web page. This could be done by, for instance, modifying user-supplied content that gets incorporated into one of these variables.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to inject unsanitized input into the title parameters of the application. This could involve finding an endpoint that allows an attacker to supply unsanitized content that ends up being rendered in the title.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by removing the use of `.html_safe` from the title tag and relying on the default escaping mechanism. The title is now rendered by the following line:
```
%title= [@title, @subject.try(:subject_code_was), @project.try(:name), ENV["website_name"]].flatten.compact.uniq.join(" - ")
```
This ensures that any HTML characters are escaped and rendered as plain text, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.
