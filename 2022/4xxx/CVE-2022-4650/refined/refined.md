The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4650.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the HashBar WordPress plugin not properly validating and escaping a shortcode attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The plugin allows the use of the `hashbar_btn` shortcode with a `btn_target` attribute. The value provided for this attribute is not sanitized, thus allowing the injection of malicious javascript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website that uses the vulnerable plugin.
- This malicious code could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website, among other things.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted shortcode.
- Specifically, the `btn_target` attribute of the `hashbar_btn` shortcode is vulnerable.
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript by adding the vulnerable shortcode to a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on the vulnerable WordPress site with a minimum role of contributor.
- The attacker is able to use shortcodes.
- No special privileges are necessary beyond the contributor role, this is an unauthenticated stored XSS attack.
