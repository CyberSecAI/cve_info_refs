- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin "Rich Table of Contents" does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, which will be executed in the browsers of other users, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the shortcode attributes that are not sanitized. Specifically, injecting malicious JavaScript into the `frame_design` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor role permissions to embed shortcodes into pages/posts.
