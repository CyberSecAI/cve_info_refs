The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4158.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `cg_Fields` POST parameter before it's concatenated into an SQL query within the `users-registry-check-registering-and-login.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLI): The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: Attackers can potentially leak sensitive data from the WordPress site's database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a crafted `cg_Fields` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Unauthenticated access: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users/visitors of the website. The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
