```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate the class name submitted by the request when instantiating an object in the prompt_dismiss_notice action and also lacks CSRF check in the related action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "PHP Object Injection",
     "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform Object Injection attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to the admin-ajax.php endpoint with the action set to 'prompt_dismiss_notice' and a malicious class name.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber, or they can exploit the CSRF vector against any authenticated user."
