- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Popups plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website that will be executed in the browsers of other users, including administrators. This can lead to account takeover or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting a shortcode attribute, a user with Contributor+ level access can inject malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor access to the WordPress website to insert a crafted shortcode.
