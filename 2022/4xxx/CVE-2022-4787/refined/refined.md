The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4787.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Themify Shortcodes plugin does not properly validate and escape the attributes of its shortcodes. Specifically the `color` attribute of the `themify_button` shortcode is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected content. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a shortcode with a malicious `onmouseover` attribute, an attacker could execute Javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with a role as low as Contributor can exploit this vulnerability. This means a user who is able to create posts using the vulnerable shortcode is able to inject the malicious script.
