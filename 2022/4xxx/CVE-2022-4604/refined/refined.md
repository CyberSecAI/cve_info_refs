The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4604.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unauthenticated open redirect within the "English WordPress Admin" plugin. The plugin allows users to toggle their admin language to English using a GET parameter (`admin_custom_language_toggle`) and redirects them back using another GET parameter (`admin_custom_language_return_url`). However, this redirection was not properly validated, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL for the redirect.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Unauthenticated Open Redirect:** The plugin redirects users to an arbitrary URL specified in the `admin_custom_language_return_url` parameter without proper verification or sanitization. This allows an attacker to redirect a user to a malicious website.
-   **Lack of nonce verification:** Initially the plugin does not check the nonce for the redirect functionality, thus allowing redirection to any URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Phishing:** Attackers can use the vulnerable plugin to redirect users to a fake login page or other malicious sites, attempting to steal credentials or perform other malicious activities.
-   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could use this redirect to deliver malware.
-   **General User Deception:** An attacker could redirect users to any site they wish which can lead to a loss of trust.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **URL manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the `admin_custom_language_toggle` and the `admin_custom_language_return_url` parameters with a target URL controlled by the attacker. This can then be sent to the victim using various methods like social engineering or phishing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker does not need to authenticate in order to perform an open redirect.
-   The attacker must be able to send a malicious URL to a WordPress user that has the vulnerable plugin installed.
-   The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit `ad4ba17` includes a fix for the vulnerability by adding nonce verification on the redirection.
- The `readme.txt` file also contains a note that the vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5.2.
