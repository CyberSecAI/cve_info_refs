Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause was a SQL injection vulnerability. The original code constructed a SQL query by directly embedding a string of user-provided usernames into the query, without sanitizing or using parameterized queries. Specifically the line ` "username in ('" + dev_tokens_string + "')" ` was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By directly concatenating the `dev_tokens_string` into the SQL query, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code if they can control the content of `dev_tokens_users`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database permissions of the account used by the application, the attacker might be able to escalate their privileges.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could also manipulate the database in a way that could cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Manipulation:** An attacker could craft specific usernames containing malicious SQL code, which would be passed into the query through `dev_tokens_users` and then `dev_tokens_string`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of the `dev_tokens_users` variable. It is not specified how this is done.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by using a parameterized query instead of string concatenation. The fix uses `cursor.execute(update_new_dev_tokens_statement, dev_tokens_users)` with a prepared statement. The code also uses `("username in (" + ("%s, " * (len(dev_tokens_users) - 1)) + "%s)")` to generate the `IN` clause of the SQL query. This approach ensures that the database treats user inputs as data, not executable code, preventing SQL injection attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit message "fixed sql update to avoid sql injection" and the pull request title "Add dev tokens" further confirm the nature of the vulnerability and its resolution.
- The SonarCloud analysis indicates no bugs, vulnerabilities, security hotspots or code smells were found after the fix.
