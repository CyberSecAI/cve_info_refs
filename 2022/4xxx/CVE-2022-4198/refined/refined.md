Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4198:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Social Sharing plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically the 'Default share image' input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  -  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable setting. This can lead to various malicious activities like:
     - Session hijacking
     - Cookie theft
     - Defacement of the website
     - Redirection to malicious sites
     - Arbitrary actions within the application context.

**Attack vectors:**
  - The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress dashboard.
  - The attacker navigates to the plugin's settings page and injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Default share image" input field.
  - Once the settings are saved, the stored XSS payload will be executed when an administrator views the page again.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker must have a high privilege account, specifically an administrator account on the WordPress site.
  - The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional Notes:**
  - The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, potentially bypassing some security restrictions on a multisite WordPress installation.
  - The provided CVSS score indicates a 'low' severity, this is because the attack requires high privileges.
  - The 'Proof of Concept' section of the report details how to reproduce the vulnerability.
  - There is no fix mentioned for this vulnerability.
