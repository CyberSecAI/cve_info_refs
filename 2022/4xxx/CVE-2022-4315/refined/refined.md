Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-4315 (Based on filename, but actual details are from the HackerOne report)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) analyzer in GitLab was not filtering URLs during the authentication phase, causing it to send custom request headers to unintended domains. This is despite a previous fix that was supposed to prevent such leaks during the actual scanning phase.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Header Leakage:** The DAST analyzer sends custom configured headers during the authentication phase to any URL visited during authentication, including those not part of the target application.
*   **Insufficient URL Filtering:** The DAST tool lacked proper filtering of URLs during the authentication phase, leading to the transmission of sensitive headers to external domains.
*   **Bypass of Previous Fix:** The vulnerability bypasses the intended fix for header leakage by exploiting the auth phase of scanning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Highly sensitive headers (e.g., Authorization tokens) configured for DAST scans are leaked to potentially malicious or unintended third-party domains. This could lead to account compromise or further unauthorized access, depending on the nature of the leaked headers.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously Crafted Pages:** An attacker can inject references to external URLs, such as in CSS or form actions, within a page visited during the authentication phase of DAST scans to collect leaked headers.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Scenarios:** Although not explicitly stated, leaked headers sent to a malicious third-party server could potentially allow for MITM attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Influence Scanned Page Content:** The attacker needs to influence the content of the page that is visited during the authentication phase of the DAST scan. This can be done if the attacker has control over a web page being scanned.
*   **Basic Web Development Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of web development (e.g., how CSS and form elements work).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability occurs because the DAST analyzer does not filter external URLs during the authentication phase. This vulnerability is still present even if a previous fix was implemented for the scanning phase.
*   The provided example involves a page with a link to an external CSS file and a form that submits to a different domain, leading to two header leak requests to an attacker controlled server.
*   The issue was discovered by "joaxcar" and reported on HackerOne.
*   The fix should prevent leaking configured headers in the authentication phase to external URLs.
