## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Link Library < 7.4.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Install the plugin and go to: wp-admin/admin.php?page=link-library-general-options&currenttab=ll-general
2. Insert the payload in the 'Links Date Format', such as: '"><script>alert(/xss/);</script><'".
3. Refresh the page to get the XSS popup.

### Affects Plugins

Fixed in 7.4.1
