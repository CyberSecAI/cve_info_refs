Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of missing authorization checks and insecure handling of user-supplied data within the `cool_plugins_install` function in multiple WordPress plugins developed by Cool Plugins. This function is intended to download and install plugins from a remote URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Missing Capability Check:** The `cool_plugins_install` function lacks a proper capability check to ensure only authorized users (e.g., administrators) can execute this function.
2.  **Insecure Nonce Handling:** The function relies on user-provided values for `wp_nonce` and `nonce_name` parameters, which are intended to be security tokens. It verifies these values using `wp_verify_nonce` but an attacker can retrieve any nonce in the source of the HTML page and use it to bypass this check.
3.  **Unsanitized URL Input:** Although the provided code includes `filter_var($_REQUEST['url'], FILTER_SANITIZE_URL)` to sanitize the URL, this function is vulnerable because an attacker can supply the URL of a malicious plugin which will then be installed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to install arbitrary WordPress plugins by providing a malicious URL, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By installing a malicious plugin, an attacker can gain full control of the affected WordPress site.
*   **Arbitrary Plugin Activation:** Additionally, the plugins are vulnerable to arbitrary plugin activation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via an AJAX request to the vulnerable `cool_plugins_install` function.
*   The attacker sends a crafted POST request with the URL of a malicious plugin and a valid nonce value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target WordPress site, even with minimal permissions such as a subscriber.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site, including the plugin's AJAX endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple plugins developed by "Cool Plugins."
*   The Cool Timeline plugin was also affected but was not exploitable due to a coding error in the vulnerable function.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in subsequent versions of the plugins, so updating is the recommended remediation.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High)
