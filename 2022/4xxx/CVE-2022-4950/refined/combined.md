# 8 WordPress plugins fixed high severity vulnerability.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [April 12, 2022 - 11:48am [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/8-wordpress-plugins-fixed-high-severity-vulnerability/)

Eight WordPress plugins were prone to an authenticated arbitrary plugin installation vulnerability, among other issues.

### Vulnerable Plugins

* [Events Shortcodes For The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/template-events-calendar/) <=1.9.4 (10k+ installations)
* [Cryptocurrency Widgets – Price Ticker & Coins List](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cryptocurrency-price-ticker-widget/) <=2.4 (10k+ installations)
* [Cryptocurrency Donation Box – Bitcoin & Crypto Donations](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cryptocurrency-donation-box/) <=1.7 (5k+ installations)
* [The Events Calendar Widgets For Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-widgets-for-elementor-and-the-events-calendar/) <=1.4.3 (5k+ installations)
* [Event Single Page Templates Addon For The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-page-templates-addon-for-the-events-calendar/) <=1.5 (3k+ installations)
* [The Events Calendar Search Addon](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-search-addon-for-the-events-calendar/) <=1.1.3 (2k+ installations)
* [The Events Calendar Countdown Addon](https://wordpress.org/plugins/countdown-for-the-events-calendar/) <=1.3.1 (2k+ installations)
* [Cryptocurrency Widgets For Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cryptocurrency-widgets-for-elementor/) <=1.2.1 (1k+ installations)

Additional plugins:

* [Cool Timeline](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cool-timeline/) <=2.3.3 (+20k installations): although this plugin includes the same vulnerability, it isn’t exploitable because of a coding error in the vulnerable function.

### Authenticated arbitrary plugin installation

CVSS v3.1: [8.8 (High)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

As all plugins include the same vulnerability (scripts and actions name may differ from one another), I’ll review the “Events Shortcodes For The Events Calendar” plugin in this advisory.

In the admin/events-addon-page/events-addon-page.php script, the plugin loads the `cool_plugins_install` fuction via an authenticated `cool_plugins_install_the-events-calendar` AJAX action:

```
add_action('wp_ajax_cool_plugins_install_'. $this->plugin_tag, array($this, 'cool_plugins_install'));

```

The function is used to download a remotely hosted plugin, in ZIP archive format, and to extract its content into the WordPress plugins folder:

```
/**
* handle ajax for installing plugin from the dashboard.
* This function use the core wordpress functionality of installing a plugin through URL
*/
function cool_plugins_install(){
   if( isset( $_POST['wp_nonce'] ) && isset( $_POST['nonce_name'] ) && wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['wp_nonce'] , $_POST['nonce_name'] )){
      require_once 'includes/cool_plugins_downloader.php';
      $downloader = new cool_plugins_downloader();
      return  $downloader->install( $_REQUEST['url'], 'install' );
   }else{
      die('wp nonce verification failed!');
   }
   die();
}

```

The function lacks a capability check, and the name and value of the security nonce (`$_POST['wp_nonce']` and `$_POST['nonce_name']`) are user input.

An authenticated user can retrieve any nonce in the source of the HTML page, such as the WordPress log out nonce, use it to bypass the check, and download and extract a remote ZIP file on the blog, which can lead to remote code execution:

### Additional issues

All plugins, including Cool Timeline, were prone to an authenticated plugin activation vulnerability.

### Recommendations

Update immediately if you have the vulnerable versions installed on your blog. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

### Timeline

The issue was discovered and reported to the WordPress Plugin Team on April 1st, 2022.
