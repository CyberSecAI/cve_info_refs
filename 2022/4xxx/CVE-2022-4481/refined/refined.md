- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper input sanitization of shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account compromise (especially of administrators) and further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By using a crafted shortcode that injects malicious Javascript, such as `[mesmerize\_latest\_news item\_class='" onmouseover="alert(1)']`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs contributor-level access or higher, and the Mesmerize theme has to be enabled.
