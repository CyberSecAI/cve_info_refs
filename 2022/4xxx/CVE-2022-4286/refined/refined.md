- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the System Diagnostics Manager (SDM) component of B&R Automation Runtime.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the attacked user's browser session, potentially modifying or stealing information available within that session.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious hyperlink containing script code. This link, when clicked by a user, triggers the XSS vulnerability. The user has to be enticed to click the link by means of phishing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require physical access to the system running B&R Automation Runtime or the user's computer but must be able to deliver a crafted link to the user through untrusted channels (emails, social media, etc.). The user needs to have a session with the vulnerable webserver.
