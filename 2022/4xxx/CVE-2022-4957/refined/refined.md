Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `results/stats.php` file. Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` parameter, which was used to fetch speed test results, was being directly included in HTML output without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the code directly includes the `$_GET['id']` value within HTML without using `htmlspecialchars` or a similar function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code by crafting a URL with a specially crafted `id` parameter. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal user cookies and session information.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the page or inject unwanted content.
    - Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `id` GET parameter in the URL when accessing the `results/stats.php` page. An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the `id` parameter and send it to a victim, or host it on a malicious site and trick the user into visiting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter and have a victim click on the link. The attacker does not need any special access or authentication.

**Additional Details:**
The commit `a85f2c086f3449dffa8fe2edb5e2ef3ee72dc0e9` addresses the vulnerability by applying `htmlspecialchars` to the `$_GET['id']` parameter when it is included within the HTML output. The code diff shows the following changes:
```diff
-        echo '<div>There was an error trying to fetch the speedtest result for ID "'.$\_GET['id'].'".</div>';
+        echo '<div>There was an error trying to fetch the speedtest result for ID "'.htmlspecialchars($\_GET['id'], ENT\_HTML5, 'UTF-8').'".</div>';
-        echo '<div>Could not find a speedtest result for ID "'.$\_GET['id'].'".</div>';
+        echo '<div>Could not find a speedtest result for ID "'.htmlspecialchars($\_GET['id'], ENT\_HTML5, 'UTF-8').'".</div>';
```
This change ensures that any HTML special characters within the `id` parameter are encoded before being rendered in the HTML output preventing XSS.
