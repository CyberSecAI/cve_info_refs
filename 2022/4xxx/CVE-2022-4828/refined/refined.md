- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Bold Timeline Lite plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users, including those with high privileges like administrators. This could lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode and using it in a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in the WordPress site.
