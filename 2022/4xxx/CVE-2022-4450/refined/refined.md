Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `PEM_read_bio_ex()` function of OpenSSL. This function reads a PEM file, parses it, and decodes the "name", header, and payload data.
- When a PEM file with 0 bytes of payload data is processed, `PEM_read_bio_ex()` returns a failure code. However, in this failure case, the function populates the `header` argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The primary weakness is a double free condition. If the caller of `PEM_read_bio_ex()` attempts to free the `header` buffer when the function returns a failure due to a 0-byte payload, a double free occurs, because the function already freed the buffer internally.
- **Dangling Pointer:** The function returns a pointer to memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most likely impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash due to the double free, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can supply a specially crafted PEM file to trigger the vulnerability, causing the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the parsing of malicious PEM files. An attacker needs the ability to supply such files to an application that uses vulnerable versions of OpenSSL's PEM parsing functions.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by providing a crafted PEM file as an input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PEM file to an application that uses vulnerable versions of `PEM_read_bio_ex()` or its wrappers (`PEM_read_bio()` and `PEM_read()`).
- The attacker does not need any special privileges. User interaction is not required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects the `PEM_read_bio_ex()`, `PEM_read_bio()`, `PEM_read()` functions.
- Several functions are indirectly affected, including `PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex()` and `SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()`.
- Some internal OpenSSL uses of these functions are not vulnerable as they do not free the header if `PEM_read_bio_ex()` fails.
- The `asn1parse` command-line tool is also vulnerable.
- The vulnerability exists in OpenSSL versions 3.0 and 1.1.1 but is not present in 1.0.2
- This vulnerability is rated as **High** severity by GitHub Advisory database.

The provided information also includes the patch, which involves setting `*header` and `*data` to NULL after freeing the allocated memory during failure conditions in the `PEM_read_bio_ex` function. This avoids the double free and dangling pointer scenarios by preventing the caller from freeing already released memory.
