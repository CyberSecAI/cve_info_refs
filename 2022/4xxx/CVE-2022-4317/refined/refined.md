  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The DAST scanner includes custom request headers in redirects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DAST scanner sends custom request headers even when a link redirects to another URL, leading to potential header leaks.",
     "Redirects are not filtered, allowing the scanner to send custom headers to the redirected URL."
    ],
    "impact": "Leakage of sensitive information included in custom request headers to unintended third-party domains.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious actor can set up a web page with a redirect, either via a link or another mechanism such as CSS, to a URL they control.",
      "The attacker leverages the DAST scanner to scan their page, causing the scanner to follow the redirect.",
      "When the scanner follows the redirect, it sends the custom headers to the attacker's controlled URL."

    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs to control a domain or web service to receive redirected requests.",
      "Attacker must be able to induce the DAST scanner to analyze a page containing a redirect."
