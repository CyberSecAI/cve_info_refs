- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `wp_user_id` GET parameter is not escaped before being concatenated into an SQL query within the `management-show-user.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious users with administrator privileges can potentially leak sensitive information from the site's database.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable parameters, including a manipulated `wp_user_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges on the WordPress site (or in a multisite WordPress configuration).
