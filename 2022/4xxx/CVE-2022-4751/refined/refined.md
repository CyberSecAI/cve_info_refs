- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Word Balloon WordPress plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, which can be executed when a user views a page containing the crafted shortcode. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, or other malicious activities. The vulnerability can be exploited against high-privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode using the vulnerable `word_balloon_wallpaper` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to have at least "contributor" level access to a WordPress website. The attacker can insert malicious shortcodes in posts/pages.
