- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CPO Companion plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape shortcode attributes before rendering them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users, including those with administrative privileges. This can lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode, such as `[testimonial id='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"']`, and including it in a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level access in WordPress to be able to insert the shortcode, although the impact is on higher privileged users.
