- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Paytium plugin does not sanitize or escape some settings. Specifically, the 'Live API Key' and 'Test API Key' fields within the plugin's settings page are vulnerable to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. These scripts would then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the plugin settings page or any other page that renders the vulnerable fields. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or even administrative actions on the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin settings page. An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Live API Key' and 'Test API Key' fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as admin access, to be able to modify the plugin's settings. The attacker must also be able to access the WordPress admin dashboard.
