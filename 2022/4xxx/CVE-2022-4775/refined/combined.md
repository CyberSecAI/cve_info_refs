## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# GeoDirectory < 2.2.22 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Note: First, you need to add a Place, and the id is the post id of the previously added place, and the key is the meta key.
Exploit shortcode:
[gd\_post\_meta id='1' key='city' css\_class='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"']

### Affects Plugins
