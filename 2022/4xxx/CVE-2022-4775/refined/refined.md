- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GeoDirectory plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users, including administrators, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can use a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in attributes like `css_class`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with at least Contributor role, which allows them to create or edit posts with shortcodes.
