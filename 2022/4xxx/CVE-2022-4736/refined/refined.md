Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of the `raw` helper method in multiple ERB template files. The `raw` helper renders a string without escaping HTML entities. When used with user-controlled data (in this case, the `the_title` variable which includes the `params[:page]` parameter from the URL), it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, including malicious JavaScript code, into the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By manipulating the `page` parameter in the URL, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the rendered HTML of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session. This allows them to:
  - Steal cookies and session tokens, leading to account compromise.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Deface the website.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the `page` parameter in the URL. For example, a URL like `https://example.com/posts?page=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` would execute the embedded script on a vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct URLs with embedded JavaScript. This could be done by sharing the malicious URL directly with the victim or by tricking the user to click a manipulated link.

**Additional Details:**

The commit message "Remove 'raw' to fix XSS" clearly indicates that the vulnerability is an XSS issue, and the code changes remove the `raw` helper from the ERB templates, replacing it with standard interpolation (`<%= the_title %>`). This ensures that HTML entities in the `the_title` variable are properly escaped.

The files affected are:

- `app/views/posts/archive.html.erb`
- `app/views/posts/contributions.html.erb`
- `app/views/posts/index.html.erb`
- `app/views/torrents/index.html.erb`

The commit description also refers to an Open Bug Bounty report: `<https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/3022583/>`, which provides further context about the discovered XSS vulnerability.
