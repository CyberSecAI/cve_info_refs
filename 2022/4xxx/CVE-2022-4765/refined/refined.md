- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected content. This can be used against high-privilege users like admins, potentially leading to account compromise or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by using a crafted shortcode, specifically using the `zoom_effect` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a role with at least contributor privileges to be able to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.
