## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP-Lister Lite for Amazon < 2.4.4 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escapes a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which can be used against high-privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

1. Install and activate WooCommerce (dependency, no setup required)
2. Install and activate the vulnerable plugin (wp-lister-for-amazon 2.4.2)
Make a logged-in admin and open the following URL:
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpla-settings&tab=accounts&spapi\_oauth\_code=x&selling\_partner\_id=xxx"><script>alert(`xss`)</script>
