- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a high-privilege user, such as an administrator. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and tricking a logged-in administrator into accessing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and induce a logged-in administrator to visit it.
