- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Sitemap plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that can be executed when a user visits the page, which can be used to steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform actions on behalf of the user. This can be used against high privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted shortcode, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a role with "Contributor" privileges or higher.
