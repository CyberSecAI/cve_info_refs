- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page/post, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users visiting the page. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, defacement, and redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By using a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in its attributes, which are then embedded on a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role on the WordPress site to be able to create/edit posts and embed the malicious shortcode.
