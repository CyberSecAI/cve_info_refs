## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple File Downloader <= 1.0.4 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a Contributor+ create a new post and add the following shortcode.
[media-downloader media\_id='1' class='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
Save it to be reviewed.
When an admin reviews the post and moves the mouse over the added code, the payload will be delivered.
