### hw/display/qxl: Avoid buffer overrun in qxl\_phys2virt (CVE-2022-4144)

```

Have qxl_get_check_slot_offset() return false if the requested
buffer size does not fit within the slot memory region.

Similarly qxl_phys2virt() now returns NULL in such case, and
qxl_dirty_one_surface() aborts.

This avoids buffer overrun in the host pointer returned by
memory_region_get_ram_ptr().

Fixes: CVE-2022-4144 (out-of-bounds read)

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white
paper](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/docs/whitepapers/en/Varonis-Ransomware-Whitepaper-Netapp.pdf) -
As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1979882#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-07-07 10:22:01 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1979882#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-07-07 10:22:09 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=low  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1979858,1979882  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1979882#c2)  Ben Cotton    2022-05-12 16:40:44 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora Linux 34 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora Linux 34 on 2022-06-07. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a 'version' of '34'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, change the 'version'  to a later Fedora Linux version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora Linux 34 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora Linux, you are encouraged to change the 'version' to a later version prior to this bug being closed.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1979882#c3)  Ben Cotton    2022-06-08 01:03:02 UTC  ``` Fedora Linux 34 entered end-of-life (EOL) status on 2022-06-07.  Fedora Linux 34 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release.

### hw/display/qxl: Pass requested buffer size to qxl\_phys2virt()

```

Currently qxl_phys2virt() doesn't check for buffer overrun.
In order to do so in the next commit, pass the buffer size
as argument.

For QXLCursor in qxl_render_cursor() -> qxl_cursor() we
verify the size of the chunked data ahead, checking we can
access 'sizeof(QXLCursor) + chunk->data_size' bytes.
Since in the SPICE_CURSOR_TYPE_MONO case the cursor is
assumed to fit in one chunk, no change are required.
In SPICE_CURSOR_TYPE_ALPHA the ahead read is handled in
qxl_unpack_chunks().

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c0)  Christophe Fergeau    2022-08-26 10:15:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1907794](attachment.cgi?id=1907794 "Patch I applied to the fedora package") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1907794&action=edit "Patch I applied to the fedora package") Patch I applied to the fedora package  CentOS9/RHEL9 are built for the x86_64-v2 microarchitecture, which is not supported by the default qemu64 CPU used by qemu-x86_64-static. In particular, this means that one cannot use qemu together with binfmt to run these x86_64 binaries transparently on an aarch64 fedora install. The error message is "Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2"  This can be worked around by manually using a --cpu argument, for example 'qemu-x86_64-static --cpu max', possibly through a wrapper script if one wants to use this together with binfmt.  However, there is one use case when this is not possible, which is when trying to use qemu-x86_64-static + binfmt through podman, the full report/investigation is in <https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15456> More details are in this comment <https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15456#issuecomment-1228210973>:  >  When starting a container, [podman] enters a mount namespace corresponding to the filesystem of the container image, and then it's exec'ing /bin/bash or whatever the user asks it to run in the container. If it's a native binary, all is fine, if it's a non-native binary (x86_64 on aarch64 for example), then the kernel binfmt support kicks in.  > qemu-user uses the 'F' flag in its binfmt configuration (see <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.19/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html> ), which means /usr/bin/qemu-x86_64-static will be found regardless of the currently active mount namespace/changeroot/... However, this binary will be running in the mount namespace context, which means it will only be able to access the files available in the container image. This in particular means that we can't use a helper process which will then invoke qemu-x86_64-static with the right flags, as the latter is not going to be present in the container image filesystem.  > <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.19/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html> is also quite clear that it's not possible to pass additional arguments to the binfmt interpreter [without using a helper script/wrapper]  > At this point, the best course of action will be to try to change the default CPU used by qemu-user-static-x86 so that it has x86_64-v2 support.   I made a scratch QEMU build at <https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=91274481> with the attached patch applied, and this allows `podman run -it --rm --arch x86_64 registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9 echo "hello world"` to be successfully run.  This also impacts podman-machine/crc which are used to run containers on macOS M1 machines as they both run a f36 VM on macOS, and then run podman/its containers inside this VM. This means running x86_64 ubi9 images on the M1 is currently not working.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c1)  Richard W.M. Jones    2022-08-26 10:30:58 UTC  ``` Since you're using TCG + -cpu max, please be aware of [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082806](show_bug.cgi?id=2082806) <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1023> which causes intermittent crashes.  You need to use `-cpu max,la57=off'   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c2)  Daniel Berrangé    2022-08-26 10:49:40 UTC  ``` Hmm, I think there's a strong case to be made that all the qemu-XXXX  userspace emulators should default to '-cpu max' (for targets where this exists).  We only stick with qemu64 for machine emulators, since ABI is important for VMs. There are few, if any,  guest ABI concerns for the userspace emulators, so switching to the best CPU is likely without significant downside.  I'll raise this question upstream, as it makes more sense todo that everything, rather than distro-by-distro.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c3)  Christophe Fergeau    2022-08-26 11:31:44 UTC  ``` Fwiw, docker is already carrying a patch to default to '-cpu max' for their userspace emulators: <https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt/blob/master/patches/cpu-max/0001-default-to-cpu-max-on-x86-and-arm.patch> I agree it's better if this can be changed upstream.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c4)  Daniel Berrangé    2022-08-26 11:52:00 UTC  ``` [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2022-08/msg04066.html(In](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2022-08/msg04066.html%28In) reply to Daniel Berrangé from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c2))  > Hmm, I think there's a strong case to be made that all the qemu-XXXX  > userspace emulators should default to '-cpu max' (for targets where this > exists).

Turns out most targets already pick the best CPU model, it was just x86 as the outlier.  (In reply to Christophe Fergeau from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c3)) > Fwiw, docker is already carrying a patch to default to '-cpu max' for their > userspace emulators: > <https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt/blob/master/patches/cpu-max/0001>- > default-to-cpu-max-on-x86-and-arm.patch > I agree it's better if this can be changed upstream.  The arm changes there are no-ops, since 'any' gets remapped to 'max' in arm  #ifdef CONFIG_USER_ONLY     /* For backwards compatibility usermode emulation allows "-cpu any",      * which has the same semantics as "-cpu max".      */     if (!strcmp(cpunamestr, "any")) {         cpunamestr = "max";     } #endif  so the only bit that really needed fixing is i386 and x86_64. I've posted  <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2022-08/msg04066.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c5)  Christophe Fergeau    2022-08-26 12:02:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Berrangé from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c4)) > I've posted <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2022-08/msg04066.html>  Thanks! One comment regarding the commit log (not subscribed to qemu-devel, so adding it here),   > There's no arg to podman that can be used to change the qemu-x86_64 args, and a non-root user of podman can not change binfmt rules without elevating privileges  It's not possible to pass arguments to the binary you use through binfmt, <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.19/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html> says an intermediate wrapper is needed to add arguments "If you want to pass special arguments to your interpreter, you can write a wrapper script for it". Such an intermediate wrapper is not an option for podman: when the helper is running, it is already restricted to a mount namespace (with the container filesystem) where qemu-x86_64-static won't be available.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c6)  Christophe Fergeau    2022-09-20 13:54:44 UTC  ``` I don't think the upstream patch was ever merged? Should this be added to the fedora packages for now?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c7)  Daniel Berrangé    2022-09-28 08:38:11 UTC  ``` The patches are sent for merge now, so we should be good to follow in Fedora at this point <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2022-09/msg04787.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c8)  Christophe Fergeau    2022-11-22 11:39:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1926383](attachment.cgi?id=1926383&action=diff "Patch for the rawhide package") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1926383&action=edit "Patch for the rawhide package") Patch for the rawhide package  This adds the patch which went upstream to the rawhide package.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c9)  Fedora Update System    2023-01-03 11:55:27 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2023-c8a60f6f80 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 36. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-c8a60f6f80>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2121700#c10)  Fedora Update System    2023-01-04 01:35:49 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2023-c8a60f6f80 has been pushed to the Fedora 36 testing repository.

### hw/display/qxl: Have qxl\_log\_command Return early if no log\_cmd handler

Only 3 command types are logged: no need to call qxl_phys2virt()
for the other types. Using different cases will help to pass
different structure sizes to qxl_phys2virt() in a pair of commits.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
