```json
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists between the time a commit is added to a Merge Request (MR) and the system removing existing approvals. The system takes 5-10 seconds to remove approvals after a new commit, during which the merge button remains active.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.",
       "Insufficient synchronization of approval status after commit."
    ],
    "impact": "A user with merge permissions can bypass the 'when a commit is added, remove all existing approvals' setting, allowing them to introduce unreviewed changes to protected branches after a merge request has been initially approved.",
    "attack_vectors": "A user with write access to the source branch of a Merge Request can push new commits after the MR has been approved but before the system removes approvals.",
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Write access to the source branch of a merge request",
      "Permission to merge the merge request"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was successfully reproduced on gitlab.com and a self-hosted GitLab instance. The time window for exploitation is approximately 5-10 seconds after pushing the new commit, during which the merge can be performed without requiring re-approval."
