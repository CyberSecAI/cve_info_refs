## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# 10WebMapBuilder < 1.0.72 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit: [Google\_Maps\_WD map='1' id='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style=']
