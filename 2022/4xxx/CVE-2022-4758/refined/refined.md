The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of shortcode attributes within the 10WebMapBuilder plugin before they are outputted on a page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to validate and escape shortcode attributes, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected and stored on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the affected page.
- This could lead to various malicious actions such as:
  - Stealing session cookies and user credentials.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's shortcode functionality.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a shortcode attribute.
- When the shortcode is rendered on a page, the injected script is executed in the user's browser.
