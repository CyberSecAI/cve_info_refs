Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `search-property.php` file. Specifically, the `$_POST['search_property']` variable is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query. The attacker-controlled input is used in a `LIKE` clause for a fuzzy search without proper escaping, making the system vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal details, or any other data stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could also modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** As the provided POC shows, the attacker can also extract the database user, potentially leading to further attacks based on the user privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `search_property` POST parameter sent to `search-property.php`. By crafting a malicious SQL payload within the `search_property` parameter, the attacker can inject SQL code into the database query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to `search-property.php` with a controlled value for the `search_property` parameter. This can be done via a web browser or any HTTP client.
- The attacker needs knowledge of how SQL syntax works to formulate effective injection attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) `123' or (select 1 from (select count(*),concat(user(),floor(rand(0)*2))x from information_schema.tables group by x)a)-- ace`  demonstrates how to extract the current user from the database by injecting SQL code. This highlights the severity of the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code snippet is explicitly shown as:
```php
$q_string = $_POST['search_property'];
$sql="SELECT * FROM add_property where concat(zone,district,province,city,tole,property_type,country) like '%$q_string%'";
$query=mysqli_query($db,$sql);
```
This clearly illustrates the lack of sanitization or prepared statements.
