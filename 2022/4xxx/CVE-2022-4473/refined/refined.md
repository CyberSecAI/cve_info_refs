- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions when a victim visits the page with the injected script. The attacker could leverage this to target higher privileged users like admins.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's shortcode functionality. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with Contributor role is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
