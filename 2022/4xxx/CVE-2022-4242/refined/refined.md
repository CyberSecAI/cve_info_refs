- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected pages.
- **Attack vectors:** A high-privilege user (e.g., admin) can inject the malicious script via a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user like an administrator. They also need to have the ability to make POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and have a valid nonce key.
