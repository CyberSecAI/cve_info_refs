The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4274, as it describes an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input in the `view-property.php` file. Specifically, the `property_id` parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- This could lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion of data.
- It could also allow for privilege escalation or further compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the `property_id` GET parameter in the `view-property.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or positions.
- The attacker needs to craft an SQL injection payload.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is located within `view-property.php`, lines 32-34.
- The code directly uses the `$_GET['property_id']` parameter in the SQL query:
  ```php
  $property_id=$_GET['property_id'];
  $sql="SELECT * from add_property where property_id='$property_id'";
  $query=mysqli_query($db,$sql);
  ```
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) is: `http://xxx.com/view-property.php?property_id=124%27%20and%20(select%201%20from%20(select%20count(*),concat(user(),floor(rand(0)*2))x%20from%20information_schema.tables%20group%20by%20x)a)--%20ace`. This POC is crafted to extract information about the database users and schema.
