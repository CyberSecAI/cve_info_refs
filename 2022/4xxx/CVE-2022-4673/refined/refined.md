- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape one of its shortcode attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website that will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the `ratemypost-result` shortcode with a crafted `id` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Users with a role as low as contributor can exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to add shortcodes to posts or pages.
