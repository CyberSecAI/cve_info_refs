- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement via an AJAX action. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other unauthorized actions. In this case, the CVSS score indicates high confidentiality impact but no integrity or availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through an AJAX action which is available to unauthenticated users. A GET request with a crafted `Cookie` parameter is used to inject SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely. The attacker needs to craft the malicious SQL injection payload and send it within a crafted HTTP request.
