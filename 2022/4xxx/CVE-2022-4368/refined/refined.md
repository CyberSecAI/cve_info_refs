{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page when importing a CSV, and does not have CSRF checks in place.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Lack of CSRF protection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to actions performed on behalf of the user, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Importing a specially crafted CSV file containing malicious JavaScript code.",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to either trick a logged-in administrator to import a malicious CSV file or perform a CSRF attack by tricking the administrator into submitting a crafted import request."
