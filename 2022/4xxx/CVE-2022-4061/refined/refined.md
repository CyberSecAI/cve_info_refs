- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate file names and types in its file upload functionalities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, such as PHP files, leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the plugin's AJAX endpoint (`admin-ajax.php?action=jb-upload-company-logo`) with a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site. No authentication is required. The attacker needs to extract the nonce from the "Jobs" page.
