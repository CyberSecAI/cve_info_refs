### @brandonsturgeon **[brandonsturgeon](/brandonsturgeon)** commented [Jul 13, 2022](#issue-1302857999) • edited Loading

Because the URL for this part is injected into an HTML blob, attackers can manually send a malicious part that can run arbitrary javascript code on any client that renders their PAC.

My fix updates the `pac.FixUrl` method to strip out exploitative HTML characters (that aren't valid in URLs anyway), and ensures that the `size` parameter is a number before concatenating it into the HTML blob.

This has been tested on our server and works as expected with no noticeable side effects.

Big thanks to [@plally](https://github.com/plally) for helping me quickly investigate this.

Sorry, something went wrong.
