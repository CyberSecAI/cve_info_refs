Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of URLs within the `pac.FixUrl` function and the `size` parameter in the `urltex.StartDownload` function. These values are concatenated into an HTML blob without proper sanitization, leading to an HTML injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTML Injection:** The application directly injects user-controlled data (URLs and size parameters) into an HTML context without proper encoding or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The original `pac.FixUrl` function did not adequately strip potentially malicious HTML characters. Similarly, the `size` parameter was not properly validated to ensure it was a number before being used in HTML construction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By injecting malicious HTML that includes JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of any client that renders the vulnerable PAC (e.g. in a game). This can be leveraged for various malicious activities, such as stealing user data, modifying page content, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** Attackers can craft URLs containing HTML characters (like `<` ,`>`, `'` , `"`) or JavaScript code.
- **Malicious Size Parameter:** Attackers can provide non-numeric values or values with special characters for size parameter, leading to injection in the generated HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide/control the URL and size parameters that are processed by the vulnerable code. This could be through a game interface or some other mechanism that transmits user-supplied URLs/size parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The commit `8fc9e12dfa21d757be6eb4194c763e848b299ac0` addresses the vulnerability.
- The fix involves:
  - Modifying `pac.FixUrl` to strip HTML characters using `url = url:gsub("[\"'<>\n\\]+", "")`.
  - Ensuring the `size` parameter is a number using `local size = tonumber(data.size or urltex.TextureSize)`.
- The vulnerability is described as an "HTML injection exploit" in the commit message and pull request title.
- The vulnerability was discovered by @brandonsturgeon.
- The pull request #1210 includes the fix to resolve the HTML injection.
- The fix was initially merged to the `master` branch and later into `develop` branch.

**Additional Notes**
- The code is written in Lua, a scripting language commonly used in games.
- The vulnerability is related to how the PAC (likely a Player Accessory Creation system) renders URLs for custom textures/images.

In summary, this is a client-side HTML injection vulnerability caused by insufficient sanitization of user-provided URLs and size parameters that are used to construct an HTML context, leading to the potential for arbitrary javascript execution.
