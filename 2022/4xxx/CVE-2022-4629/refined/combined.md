## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Product Slider for WooCommerce < 2.6.4 - Contributor+ Stored XSS in Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Install the Dependency plugin - WooCommerce: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce
Exploit shortcode:
[woo-product-slider id='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"']

### Affects Plugins
