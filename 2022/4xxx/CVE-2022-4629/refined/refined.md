- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website through the vulnerable shortcode attributes. This code can be used to perform actions on behalf of a high privilege user like an admin, steal cookies or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript within one of the shortcode attributes, such as the `id` or `style` attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a WordPress account with at least the "contributor" role to be able to post content with shortcodes.
