Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the `advertise_address` setting within the GitLab Runner's configuration. A malicious runner can specify an internal host for its session server's `advertise_address`, causing GitLab to make outbound requests to that internal address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** GitLab is making a request to a URL controlled by the GitLab Runner, which can be an internal address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Scanning:** An attacker could potentially use this to scan internal network addresses by observing the responses or lack thereof.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although the described scenario indicates a blind GET request, it can still potentially reveal internal service existence. Further exploitation may be possible if more information is gleaned or if a more complex request is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious actor configures a GitLab Runner with a crafted `advertise_address`.
*   The victim opens a web terminal session to trigger the connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control or have the ability to influence the `advertise_address` configuration setting of a GitLab Runner.
*   The attacker needs a victim to open a web terminal connected to the malicious runner.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content mentions that the impact is "likely limited" because it is a blind GET request, but also suggests that further exploitation could be possible.
* The suggested solution is to use GitLab's existing SSRF prevention library to validate the host/URI entered by the user.
