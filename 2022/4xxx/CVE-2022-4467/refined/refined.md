- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page or post that will execute when a user views the page. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities. An attacker with Contributor+ role can inject malicious scripts that could be used against high privilege users such as admin.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript within the attributes into a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor role to be able to create or edit page/post content and insert the malicious shortcode.
