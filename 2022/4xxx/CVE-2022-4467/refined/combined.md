## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Search & Filter < 1.2.16 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

Insert the following shortcode in a page/post:
[searchandfilter class='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
The alert triggers successfully when the search form is hovered with the mouse.

### Affects Plugins
