{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape the URI when logging requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website's database via the plugin's logging mechanism. This code will be executed in the browser of any logged-in administrator who views the affected logs.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the query parameters (e.g., `?s=\"<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`). When this URL is accessed, the plugin logs the unescaped URI, storing the payload in the database. ",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges. They only need to be able to send a crafted URL to the website."
