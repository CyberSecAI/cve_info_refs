Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and output escaping of shortcode attributes within the "Video Background" WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code via shortcode attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided data within shortcode attributes before rendering them in the webpage. This leads to the storage of malicious JavaScript code within the website's database.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't validate or sanitize shortcode attributes such as `container`, `mp4`, `webm`, `poster`, `loop`, `muted`, `overlay`, `overlay_color`, `overlay_alpha`, `tap_to_unmute` and `source`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** If an admin views the crafted page, the attacker may be able to leverage the XSS to perform actions with the admin account.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive user data.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify the website's content or redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect users to websites hosting malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within the shortcode attributes of the `[vidbg]` shortcode.
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious code is stored in the websiteâ€™s database and executed whenever the page/post containing the shortcode is viewed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Contributor Role or Higher:** An attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role on the WordPress site to be able to add the malicious shortcode to a page/post. This implies the attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to use shortcodes:**  The attacker needs the ability to embed shortcodes into posts or pages.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the "Video Background" plugin prior to 2.7.5.
*   Multiple shortcode attributes are affected, including `container`, `mp4`, `webm`, `poster`, `loop`, `muted`, `overlay`, `overlay_color`, `overlay_alpha`, `tap_to_unmute`, and `source`.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.5.
