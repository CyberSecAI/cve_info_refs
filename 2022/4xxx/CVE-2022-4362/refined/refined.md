- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape a shortcode attribute within the `popup_close` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they preview or view a page/popup containing the crafted shortcode. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating a new popup or editing an existing one, or by adding the malicious shortcode directly into a post/page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor privileges in WordPress.
