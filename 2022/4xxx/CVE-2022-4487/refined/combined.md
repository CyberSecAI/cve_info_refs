## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Accordion < 2.2.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[efaccordion id='"); alert(1); jQuery("']
Exploit shortcode:
[efaccordion id='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;']
