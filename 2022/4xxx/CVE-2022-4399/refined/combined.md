### **[TicklishHoneyBee](/TicklishHoneyBee)** commented [Jan 27, 2022](#issuecomment-1022978623)

| Hi, so this is a great idea, but there's a couple of issues with it as is.  Firstly, if statements with only a single line body (and no else) don't needed braces. You've added a bit of a mix and match of this so please remove some braces (most notably, around line 316 of db.c). Also some spaces were added around an '}else{' making it '} else {' and different to every other else in the project.  Secondly, you've used sqlite3\_errmsg directly inside a printf in a couple of places, please either read directly from db\_data.error\_msg (if set), or use the included wrapper function db\_err which prevents a NULL return that can cause segfaults in some printf implementations. Also, being system/internal error messages, these should use fprintf to output to stderr rather than stdout. |
