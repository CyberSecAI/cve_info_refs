Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the `tenant-register.php` and `tenant-engine.php` files of the House-Rental-System application. The `tenant-register.php` form allows users to upload files, and `tenant-engine.php` processes these uploads without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not validate the type or content of the uploaded file.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** The application saves the uploaded file with its original filename without any sanitization, which could lead to overwriting existing files.
*   **Direct File Storage:** The uploaded file is stored directly in the `tenant-photo` directory, which is accessible from the web.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file (e.g., `POC.php` containing `<?php @eval($_GET['ace']);?>`).
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By accessing the uploaded file through the browser with a crafted query parameter (e.g., `http://vulhrs.test/tenant-photo/POC.php?ace=phpinfo()`), an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:**  The vulnerability is triggered via the `tenant-register.php` form on the web interface.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `tenant-engine.php` endpoint, including the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of crafting HTTP POST requests with multipart/form-data.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code in `tenant-engine.php` is within the `tenant_register` function where the file is moved using `move_uploaded_file` to the `tenant-photo` directory. The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of the uploaded file, allowing any type of file including malicious PHP scripts to be uploaded and executed.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates uploading a PHP file with eval functionality which can be used to execute phpinfo and other code
