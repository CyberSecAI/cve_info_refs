Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of `call_user_func_array` in the `run` function within `web/leadshop.php`. The code directly takes user input from the `$_GET['include']` parameter and uses it as the name of a method to be called on the object, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is RCE. By controlling the `include` GET parameter, an attacker can invoke any public method of the object.
* **Unsanitized Input:** The vulnerability arises due to the lack of sanitization/validation of the `$_GET['include']` parameter before passing it to `call_user_func_array`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by calling specific methods with malicious payloads. This could allow for data theft, system compromise, and complete server takeover.
* **System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code could lead to a full system compromise, allowing the attacker to control the server entirely.

**Attack Vectors:**

* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests. The attacker needs to craft a specific URL with a malicious `include` parameter value. For example, `leadshop.php?include=some_malicious_method&meta=some_data`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
* **Understanding of the Application:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the available public methods of the class to craft the malicious payload.
* **Ability to manipulate GET parameters:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate URL parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided commit `f27e9ca5c93eaadda1097396b65c234b16186d67` seems to be a fix for this issue, however, the details of the fix are not entirely clear.  The commit message "fix_rce" and the changes in `leadshop.php` are consistent with an attempt to address the described vulnerability. Specifically, the commit adds a check to ensure `include` is exactly equal to "Update", which prevents calling other methods, mitigating the RCE.  However, the commit note `die("检测到非法传参，请登录后台进入更新界面");`  suggests that this fix may not be fully comprehensive.
