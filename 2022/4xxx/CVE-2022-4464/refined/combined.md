## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Themify Portfolio Post < 1.2.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escapes some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks, which could be used against high privileged users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[themify\_portfolio\_posts style='grid1" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="width:100px;height:100px;background:red;']

### Affects Plugins
