- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Themify Portfolio Post plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin is vulnerable to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the shortcode attributes, which will then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the affected page. This could lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities against high privileged users such as admins
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious shortcode with specially crafted attributes and embedding it into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to WordPress to create or modify posts/pages, allowing them to insert malicious shortcodes.
