Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `option_id` POST parameter is not properly sanitized or escaped before being concatenated into an SQL query within the `order-custom-fields-with-and-without-search.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query through the `option_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`. The `option_id` parameter in the request contains the malicious SQL code.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged into WordPress with at least "author" privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Author Role:** The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site with at least author privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `order-custom-fields-with-and-without-search.php` file of the `contest-gallery` WordPress plugin.
*   The specific vulnerable versions are prior to 19.1.5.
*  The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates a time-based SQL injection using `SLEEP(5)`.
