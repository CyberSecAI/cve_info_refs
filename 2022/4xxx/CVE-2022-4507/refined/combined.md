## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Real Cookie Banner < 3.4.10 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escapes some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged-in admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[rcb-consent class='" onmouseover="alert(1)' text='XSS' type='change']

### Affects Plugins
