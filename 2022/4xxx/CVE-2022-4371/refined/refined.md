- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter (`invoice_id`) before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. The provided CVSS score indicates a high severity rating with high confidentiality impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via the `invoice_id` parameter in the URL `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=new_web_invoice&invoice_id=...&web_invoice_action=clear_log`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged in as a user with "Manage invoice" privileges. This is typically an administrator but can potentially be a subscriber or other role depending on the plugin's configuration.
