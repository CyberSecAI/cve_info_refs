## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Web Invoice <= 2.1.3 - Authenticated SQLi

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL Injection exploitable by high privilege users such as admin by default. However, depending on the plugin configuration, other users, such as subscriber could exploit this as well

### Proof of Concept

When logged in with a user allowed to Manage invoice (default admin but can be changed via the plugin's settings), open the following URL
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=new\_web\_invoice&invoice\_id=31618572+AND+(SELECT+5926+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))erUA)&web\_invoice\_action=clear\_log
