Based on the provided content, the commit `15adb8e1ea1f1c3e3d152fc266071f621ef0c621` addresses Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the `falling-fruit/falling-fruit` repository.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `raw` to render user-provided content without proper sanitization. This allows malicious users to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code that would then be executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Specifically, stored XSS vulnerabilities are present, where malicious scripts are stored within the application and are later executed when other users view the affected pages.
- **Inadequate output sanitization:** The code uses `raw` which renders content as-is, instead of sanitizing user-provided data before rendering it in HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could:
- Steal cookies or session tokens.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Deface or modify the appearance of the website.
- Perform actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code through user-controllable fields, such as:
    - `comments` in the `imports` and `pages/datasets` views
    - `wikipedia_url` in `types/grow` and `types/index` views
    - Potentially in the `header` variable in `changes/index.html.erb`
    - Additionally, the `@categories` variable is JSON serialized directly into the page (`application.html.erb`), which is potentially also vulnerable
- When a user views a page where the unsanitized data is displayed, the injected JavaScript would execute in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to create or modify data in a way that the vulnerable code will render. This likely means the ability to add/edit content in the application.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be an administrator, but any user with write access to relevant fields can potentially exploit it.

**Specific Code Changes:**
The commit replaces instances of `raw` with `ERB::Util.html_escape` and `.html_safe` to prevent XSS. Specifically, these changes are made in:

- `app/views/changes/index.html.erb`: Replaces `<%= raw header %>` with  `<%= header.html_safe %>` (although the surrounding context suggests the data is already HTML, so this might not be a direct fix to XSS)
- `app/views/imports/show.html.erb`: Replaces  `<%= raw @import.comments.gsub("\n","<br>") %>` with  `<%= ERB::Util.html\_escape(@import.comments).gsub("\n", "<br/>").html\_safe %>` and   `<%= raw @import.license.gsub("\n","<br>") %>` with `<%= ERB::Util.html\_escape(@import.license).gsub("\n", "<br/>").html\_safe %>`
- `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`: Replaces `cats = <%= raw @categories %>;` with `cats = <%= @categories.map{|c| ERB::Util.html_escape(c)}.to_json.html_safe %>;`
- `app/views/pages/datasets.html.erb`: Replaces ` <%= raw import.comments.gsub("\n","<br/>") %>` with `<%= ERB::Util.html\_escape(import.comments).gsub("\n", "<br/>").html\_safe %>` and  `<%= raw import.license.gsub("\n","<br/>") %>` with  `<%= ERB::Util.html\_escape(import.license).gsub("\n", "<br/>").html\_safe %>`
- `app/views/types/grow.html.erb`: Replaces  `<a href="<%= raw type.wikipedia\_url %>" target="\_blank"><%= h type.en\_name %></a>` with  `<a href="<%= type.wikipedia\_url %>" target="\_blank"><%= h type.en\_name %></a>`
- `app/views/types/index.html.erb`: Replaces `<a href="<%= raw type.wikipedia\_url %>" target="\_blank">W</a>` with `<a href="<%= type.wikipedia\_url %>" target="\_blank">W</a>`

**Note:** The use of `h` in the `types/grow` and `types/index` is also a form of sanitization which converts HTML special characters to HTML entities. However, in some cases, this is not enough to mitigate XSS, which is why `ERB::Util.html_escape` is needed to sanitize input properly before using `.html_safe`.

In summary, the provided commit aims to fix XSS vulnerabilities by properly sanitizing user input, mitigating the impact of malicious scripts. The use of `ERB::Util.html_escape` is correct, and `.html_safe` is used to mark the output as safe for the browser to render.
