- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them onto the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is located in the `Landing Page Builder` plugin, specifically in how it handles shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who visit affected pages, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions. The vulnerability is exploitable by users with Contributor level access and could be used against high privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via shortcode attributes when creating a post or page. The injected code is then executed when the affected page is viewed in a browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to a WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
