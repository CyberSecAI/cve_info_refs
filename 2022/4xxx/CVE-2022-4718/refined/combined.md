## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Landing Page Builder < 1.4.9.9 - Contributor+ Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. Insert the following shortcode in a post/page: [pb\_samlple\_nav menu\_class="menu-style-1" pb\_logo\_url="invalid' onerror='alert(1)'"]
2. Browse the page/post and notice the alert triggers successfully.

### Affects Plugins
