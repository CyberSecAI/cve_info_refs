- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin includes a vulnerable vendored dompdf example file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser session by crafting a malicious URL. This could lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious script embedded in the `keyword` parameter of the `Query.php` file. The victim must then visit this malicious URL while logged in as an administrator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL. The victim needs to be a logged-in administrator to be affected, but no authentication is required for the attacker. The attacker needs to persuade an administrator to click on the link.
