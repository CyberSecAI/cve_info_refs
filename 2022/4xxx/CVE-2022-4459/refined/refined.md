- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the shortcode attributes, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored in the database and then executed when a user visits a page containing the crafted shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least the "contributor" role in WordPress to be able to insert the malicious shortcode.
