{
  "CVE-2022-4899": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mallocAndJoin2Dir` function in `util.c` of zstd library has an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. When the size of `dir1` is 0, accessing `*(buffer - 1)` leads to read out of the allocated memory region.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The out-of-bounds read can cause the program to crash or potentially leak sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `mallocAndJoin2Dir` function is called with an empty `dir1` argument.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control the input parameters of the affected function"
  }
}
