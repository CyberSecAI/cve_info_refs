- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page/post, which will be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the page. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, phishing, and malware distribution.
- **Attack vectors:** By using a specially crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in its attributes (e.g. `[dslc_notification color='red" onmouseover="alert(1)"']`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to WordPress to create or edit posts/pages and embed the malicious shortcode.
