### Description

The WP User plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via its settings parameters in versions up to, and including, 7.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

Ik heb een template gemaakt voor mijn site, maar deze plugin doet daar niets mee.
Ook zie ik geen Nederlandse vertaling.
Erg jammer, want verder ziet hij er wel mooi uit.

This plugin is very well done, it even allows you to customize the tabs of the user area.
At first I didn’t get any response to the support tickets, but I contacted the developer by email, he was very kind and quick to fix a Fatal Error of the “Login with Social Media” plugin, he also fixed the user registration through verification e-mail.
I am very happy to be able to move forward with the project now!

There are many, many useful settings for those wishing to customize users and forms. Many features are standard in this plugin where others dev’s charge for them.
Plugin Developer is responsive to issues and suggestions.
No reason found not to give 5 star rating.

Tried each and every similar form, no matter how fancy they sound, but this one really gives what it claims it does.
Simple, fast, many options, super great support even for the non-paid version, beautiful design, to the point… etc.
All the best for the developers.

Plugin looks nice and would fit my needs but:
– reCaptcha is broken => no place to set the “site key” (only private key field)
– e-mail templates are the worst ever and some can’t be edited/fixed at all
– avatar upload fails (some right issues on the file system ??)
– icons are not displayed correctly or at all when you edit your profile
Aside from that it has very nice look but still broken here and there
