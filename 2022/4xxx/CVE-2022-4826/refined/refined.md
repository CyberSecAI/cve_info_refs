- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simple Tooltips plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Contributor role or higher can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the page/post containing the malicious shortcode, potentially leading to arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with javascript, such as the provided proof of concept, an attacker can inject malicious code into the `style` attribute, which is then rendered on a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor role privileges in the WordPress instance.
