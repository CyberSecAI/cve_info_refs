The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4496.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the plugin's failure to validate the redirect parameter in the SSO login endpoint. Specifically, the plugin doesn't check if the redirect URL points to an internal site URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is an **Open Redirect** vulnerability. The lack of proper validation of the redirect parameter allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to the following:
*   **Phishing attacks:** An attacker can redirect a logged-in user to a malicious site disguised as a legitimate login page, tricking them into revealing sensitive information.
*   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to sites that host malware.
*   **Loss of user trust:** Users might lose trust in the website if they are redirected to unwanted or malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker crafts a malicious URL with a redirect parameter pointing to an external, attacker-controlled site. This URL is then used in an attack, such as in a phishing email. When a user who is logged into the WordPress site clicks the malicious URL, they are redirected to the attacker's site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with arbitrary redirect parameters and be able to induce a logged-in user to click on the malicious URL. No special access to the server is required. The user needs to be logged in to the WordPress site when they click the link.

**Affected plugins:**
The vulnerability affects multiple versions of the "miniOrange WordPress SAML SSO" plugin:
*   miniOrange WordPress SAML SSO Standard versions before 16.0.8
*   miniOrange WordPress SAML SSO Premium Multisite versions before 20.0.7
*   miniOrange WordPress SAML SSO Premium versions before 12.1.0
