Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WP Cerber plugin fails to properly restrict access to the REST API users endpoint when the WordPress blog is installed in a subdirectory. This occurs even when the "Block access to users' data via REST API" setting is enabled in the plugin.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **User Enumeration Bypass:** The plugin's intended restriction on accessing user data via the REST API is bypassed.
    *   **Inconsistent Path Handling:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin not correctly handling subdirectory installations when blocking access to the REST API users endpoint.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can enumerate user accounts by accessing the REST API users endpoint. This information can be used in further attacks, such as brute-force login attempts.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability via network requests to the affected website.
    *   **REST API Endpoint:** The specific attack vector is the REST API endpoint `https://example.com/subdir//wp-json/wp/v2/users`. Note the double forward slash in the URL, this likely indicates an issue with how the path is handled by the plugin.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
    *   **Knowledge of Subdirectory:** The attacker needs to know if the target site is hosted in a subdirectory and, if so, the name of the subdirectory to successfully exploit this.

The provided content gives more specific details than a generic CVE description would, such as the specific REST API endpoint and the condition of the blog being installed in a subdirectory. It also mentions the specific plugin setting that is supposed to prevent this access, making the vulnerability more concrete.
