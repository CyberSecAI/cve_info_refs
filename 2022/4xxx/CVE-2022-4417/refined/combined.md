## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Cerber < 9.3.3 - User Enumeration Bypass via Rest API

### Description

### Proof of Concept

When the "Block access to users' data via REST API" settings is enabled (wp-admin/admin.php?page=cerber-security&tab=hardening)
https://example.com/subdir//wp-json/wp/v2/users
