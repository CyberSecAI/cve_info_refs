The provided content is related to a commit that includes security upgrades for XSS prevention. This commit introduces the `stripesafe` library and uses `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml` to sanitize user inputs.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The code was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to unsanitized user inputs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input sanitization. Specifically, the `searchTag` in `TagSearchActionBean.java` and `resourceUri` in `FactsheetActionBean.java` were not sanitized before being used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code through the `searchTag` parameter or the `resourceUri` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the `searchTag` or `resourceUri` parameters of the application, which are typically user-controlled inputs.

**Technical Details:**
- The commit introduces the `stripesafe` library to the `pom.xml` file for security purposes.
- It modifies `TagSearchActionBean.java` to sanitize the `searchTag` input by using `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml(searchTag)`.
- It modifies `FactsheetActionBean.java` to sanitize the `resourceUri` input by using `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml(resourceUri)`.
- The changes use `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml` to encode HTML characters, which will prevent browsers from interpreting them as code, thus preventing XSS.
