- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi). Specifically, a lack of input sanitization and escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion, or complete compromise of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP request to the WordPress admin interface. Specifically, by manipulating the `id` parameter of the `admin.php` page when the `action` is `delete` and the page is `wsysadmin_feeds`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator or similar high-level privileges within the WordPress application.
