## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Welcart e-Commerce < 2.8.9 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escapes one of its shortcode attributes, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform a Stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a product item to the plugin. The item name, for example, "first". You will also use this in the shortcode.
2. Exploit shortcode:
[button\_to\_cart item='first' value='SUBMIT" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="border:5px solid red;"']
