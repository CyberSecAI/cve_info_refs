- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Welcart e-Commerce plugin does not properly validate and escape the attributes of its shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input validation and output escaping of shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the page containing the crafted shortcode. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, redirecting users to phishing sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode and embedding it within a product description.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have an account with a role as low as "contributor". This role is typically able to add content to a website.
