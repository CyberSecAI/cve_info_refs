Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The commit introduces a new feature that sends email notifications to users when a new SSH key is added to their account.
*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the email notification body includes the SSH key's comment and fingerprint directly in the email, which are user controlled values that are not properly sanitized, leading to potential HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The `email_authorizedkey_added.html` template uses the user-provided `comment` and `fingerprint` variables without proper sanitization within the HTML body. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code via the comment field of the SSH Key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML, such as links that redirect to phishing websites or that inject tracking mechanisms into the email. When the user views the email notification, the injected HTML could be rendered by the email client, potentially leading to the user's credentials or other sensitive information being compromised.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Injected HTML could also be used to prompt the download of malicious files when the user opens the email in a client that renders HTML.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the email client improperly handles the rendered HTML, cross-site scripting may also occur if the user interacts with elements that run client-side code within their email viewer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker with the ability to add SSH keys to a user account can set a malicious comment while creating the key which will then be used to create a malicious email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account on the system, and the authorization to add a new SSH key to the target user's profile. This is not a vulnerability that can be exploited by someone without an account.
* The attacker also has to have the email notification feature enabled.

**Additional Details:**

*   The commit log message mentions that a fix was made to avoid email clients creating hyperlinks automatically to prevent phishing, which indicates that the development team was already aware of the potential for phishing attacks via email notifications.
*   The commit also introduces an email notification for the addition of access tokens, although this specific vulnerability is only described in reference to SSH key addition emails. It is likely, though not explicitly stated, that the access token email is also vulnerable if the access token name isn't properly sanitized.
