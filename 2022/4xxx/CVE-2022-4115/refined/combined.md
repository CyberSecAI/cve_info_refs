## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Editorial Calendar < 3.8.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing users with roles as low as contributor to inject arbitrary web scripts in the plugin admin panel, enabling a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability targeting higher privileged users.

### Proof of Concept

Login as a contributor, go to the Calendar page (https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?page=cal), and get the nonce from the edcal.wp\_nonce in the source
Make a request like https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?\_wpnonce=NONCE&action=edcal\_saveoptions&wheel-support=true});</script><script>alert(/XSS/);</script>
The XSS will be triggered for anyone viewing the Calendar page
PS: All options are affected (such as weeks , status-hide, time-hide, etc)
