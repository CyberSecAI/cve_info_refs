- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts in the plugin admin panel. This allows an attacker to execute malicious code in the browsers of users who view the Calendar page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions, specifically targeting higher privileged users.
- **Attack vectors:**  A contributor-level user can inject malicious JavaScript code through the plugin's settings (e.g., `wheel-support`, `weeks`, `status-hide`, `time-hide` options). The injected script is stored in the database and is executed when the Calendar page is viewed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with at least a contributor role. They need to access the plugin settings page and make a request to `admin-ajax.php` with the injected payload.
