## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Limit Login Attempts <= 2.6.5 - IP Spoofing

### Description

The plugin prioritizes getting a visitor's IP from certain HTTP headers over PHP's REMOTE\_ADDR, which makes it possible to bypass IP-based restrictions on login forms.

### Proof of Concept

Set HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP or HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR as used in wp\_limit\_getip() to spoof the IP address and bypass the block.
