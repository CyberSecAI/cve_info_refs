The provided content describes a vulnerability related to nested USB device reset calls, which is addressed by the patch "[PATCH 5.4 053/108] USB: core: Prevent nested device-reset calls".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of protection against nested USB device reset attempts. Specifically, a driver's `remove` routine can call `usb_reset_device()` during an ongoing USB reset, leading to a recursive locking violation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Recursive locking violation in `usb-storage` due to nested device resets.
- Lack of a mechanism in the USB core to prevent nested resets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash or instability due to recursive locking.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a device removal while an unrelated USB reset is in progress. This can happen when a driver that doesn't have `pre_reset` or `post_reset` callbacks is being unbound from a composite device.
- Fuzzing the USB subsystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger device unbinding or removal, potentially through a malicious or misbehaving driver.
- In the specific scenario, a device with the `rtl8712` driver was being unbound while an unrelated USB reset was in progress. This indicates the attacker needs a device using the rtl8712 driver and ability to trigger unbinding of the driver from the device.

The patch introduces a `reset_in_progress` flag in the `usb_device` struct and checks it before proceeding with a device reset, preventing nested resets.
