- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Product list Widget for Woocommerce" does not sanitize a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions. This impacts both unauthenticated and authenticated users, including administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing a script in the `formid` parameter of the `admin-ajax.php` request. When a user clicks this URL, the script is reflected in the response and executed by the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and trick a victim into clicking the malicious link. No prior authentication is required.
