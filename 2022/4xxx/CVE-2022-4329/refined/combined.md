## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Product list Widget for Woocommerce <= 1.0 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against both unauthenticated and authenticated users (such as high privilege one like admin).

### Proof of Concept

Make any unauthenticated or authenticated users (such as a logged-in admin) open the following URL:
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=gmwqp\_change\_cat&option=taxonomy&formid="></select><script>alert(`xss`)</script>
