- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape the `design` attribute of the `wpspw_recent_post_slider` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they visit pages containing the vulnerable shortcode, allowing for various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a malicious shortcode with an injected JavaScript payload to a post or page, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with at least a 'contributor' role, which has the ability to create posts or pages and embed shortcodes.
