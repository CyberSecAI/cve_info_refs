**CVE-2022-4850 is likely related to the fix for CSRF vulnerability**

The GitHub commit message `chore: fix CSRF ([#876](https://github.com/usememos/memos/pull/876))` and the code changes related to CSRF middleware suggest that this commit is addressing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability likely stemmed from the application's lack of proper CSRF protection, which allowed attackers to potentially forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness was the absence of a CSRF protection mechanism. This allowed an attacker to craft a malicious request and trick the victim into unknowingly performing actions they did not intend.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could have allowed an attacker to perform state-changing actions on the application as an authenticated user. This can include adding or deleting data, or even potentially manipulating user settings.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves luring an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website containing a crafted form. When the user's browser sends the request, it will also include the session cookies, making the request appear to come from the authenticated user.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to:
    *   Be able to craft a malicious request.
    *   Have the user be authenticated and active on the web application.
    *   Trick the user into sending the malicious request to the server, through the browser.

**Technical details:**

The commit includes the following key changes:

*   **server/server.go:**
    *   The commit adds `e.Use(middleware.CSRFWithConfig(middleware.CSRFConfig{ TokenLookup: "cookie:_csrf", }))` which uses the `echo` framework's middleware to implement CSRF protection. It configures CSRF token lookup through a cookie named `_csrf`.

*   **server/acl.go:**
    *   The `setUserSession` function within this file is updated to include `SameSite: http.SameSiteStrictMode`, in the session cookie,  which helps mitigate some CSRF attacks by restricting when a cookie is sent along with a request.

This commit implements a common strategy for mitigating CSRF vulnerabilities. The server now expects a CSRF token with each state-changing request, this token needs to be matched with the token stored in the user's cookie.

**Summary**
The provided content suggests that the vulnerability addressed in the commit is a CSRF vulnerability, which could have been exploited by an attacker through malicious requests. The fix implements CSRF protection using the `echo` framework's middleware and sets the session cookie with `SameSite: Strict` attribute.
