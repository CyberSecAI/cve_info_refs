- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page or post. This can lead to the attacker gaining control of a user's session, or executing arbitrary code in their browser, especially if the victim is an administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding the Feedzy RSS Feeds Block and injecting malicious code into the CSS Class option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with a role as low as "contributor" can inject the malicious code.
