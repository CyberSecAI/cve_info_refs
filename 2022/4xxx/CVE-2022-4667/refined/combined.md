## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# RSS Aggregator by Feedzy < 4.1.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. Add the Feedzy RSS Feeds Block.
2. Then add the CSS Class to the Block: " onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"
3. Hover the mouse over the content displayed by the block in a page/post to trigger the payload.
