    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2023-29380",
      "source": "www.openwall.com_8e1f6cf7_20250114_200505.html",
      "root_cause": "The `top_dir_basenames` parameter from the sender is not verified on the receiving side, leading to arbitrary file deletion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of the `top_dir_basenames` parameter",
        "Lack of input validation on `top_dir_basenames`"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote file deletion, leading to a denial of service (DoS) or data integrity issues on the receiving system. Specifically, the vulnerability allows deletion of the parent directory of the download directory, potentially leading to complete home directory removal.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious sender provides crafted `top_dir_basenames` such as `../` or absolute paths to the receiving side",
        "The vulnerability can be exploited automatically if the receiving side runs Warpinator in trusted mode, both parties share the same non-default group key, and unconfirmed file overwrites are allowed.",
        "Manual confirmation is required if the above conditions aren't met, but social engineering may trick the user"
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send files to a victim using the Warpinator application. This could be achieved if the attacker and victim are on the same network, or have otherwise configured Warpinator to allow communication between them"

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-4272",
      "source": "github.com_3e2f46a1_20250114_200506.html",
       "root_cause": "The WMS application allows unverified file uploads, enabling arbitrary code execution through a crafted PHP file.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Lack of file type validation during upload",
          "No sanitization of uploaded file contents",
          "Direct execution of uploaded PHP files"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution on the server hosting the WMS application.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Uploading a malicious PHP file through the product upload functionality.",
          "Accessing the uploaded PHP file through the web server."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the product upload functionality of the WMS application and send HTTP requests."
