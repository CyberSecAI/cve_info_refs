- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The iPages Flipbook For WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically within shortcode attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user input used in shortcode attributes, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored in the database and executed in a user's browser when the shortcode is rendered.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into website pages, leading to various actions, such as:
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user (if they are logged in)
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by using a specific shortcode with malicious JavaScript within attributes like `class`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor+ role to create a new post and insert the malicious shortcode. Although even an administrator could insert the malicious shortcode, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the XSS can be triggered even when `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled.
