- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The BruteBank plugin does not implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Absence of CSRF protection, allowing attackers to make unauthorized changes to the plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the plugin's settings, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities, changes in the application's behavior or other malicious outcomes.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTTP POST request targeting the `wp-admin/admin.php?page=brutebank-settings` endpoint, including parameters to change settings. The victim needs to be a logged in admin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in administrator to unknowingly trigger the malicious request. This can be achieved through techniques like embedding the malicious request in a link or on a website.
