The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4762.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Materialis Companion plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected pages, potentially leading to various actions such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Stealing sensitive data
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a crafted shortcode attribute.
  - A user with contributor role (or higher) can add a malicious shortcode to a post or page. When a user views this post or page, the injected script will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least contributor access to the WordPress site to create and publish posts or pages.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable shortcode is `materialis_latest_news`, specifically the `item_class` attribute.
- A sample exploit is provided, leveraging the `onmouseover` event.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.40 of the Materialis Companion plugin.
