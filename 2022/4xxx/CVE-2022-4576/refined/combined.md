## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Bootstrap Shortcode <= 4.5.4 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. Insert this shortcode in a page/post: [row class='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;"']
2. Hover over the inserted block, and the alert will trigger successfully.
