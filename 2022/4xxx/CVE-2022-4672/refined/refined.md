- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Simple Shopping Cart plugin does not properly validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the affected shortcode attributes. This injected code can then be executed in the browsers of other users, including administrators, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by using a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript within its attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to WordPress to create or modify posts or pages with the malicious shortcode.
