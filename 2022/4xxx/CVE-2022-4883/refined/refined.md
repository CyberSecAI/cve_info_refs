{
  "CVE-2022-4883": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The libXpm library uses the execlp() function to execute compression and uncompression commands (compress, gzip, uncompress, and gunzip) when dealing with files with extensions .Z or .gz. The library relies on the $PATH environment variable to locate these commands.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is present when libXpm is called from a program running with elevated privileges, such as through the setuid mechanism. If a malicious user can control the $PATH environment variable, they can cause libXpm to execute a program of their choice with those elevated privileges, resulting in arbitrary code execution.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application using libXpm.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious user needs to control the $PATH environment variable, which can be achieved via user configuration or modifying the environment before executing a setuid program. The attacker also needs to supply a specially crafted XPM image filename ending with .Z or .gz.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to influence the $PATH environment variable. This can happen through the program environment, such as when invoked via setuid mechanism. The attacker also needs to be able to supply an XPM file with a name ending in .Z or .gz."
