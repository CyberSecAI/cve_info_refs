## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# FluentAuth < 1.0.2 - Bypass blocks by IP Spoofing

### Description

The plugin prioritizes getting a visitor's IP address from certain HTTP headers over PHP's REMOTE\_ADDR, which makes it possible to bypass the IP-based blocks set by the plugin.

### Proof of Concept

Set HTTP\_X\_REAL\_IP, HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR, HTTP\_CF\_CONNECTING\_IP or HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP to spoof the IP address.

### Affects Plugins
