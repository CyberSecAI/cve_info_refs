- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page. Specifically, the `volume` attribute in the `sc_embed_player` shortcode is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted `sc_embed_player` shortcode containing a malicious `onmouseover` attribute, which injects the malicious javascript when a user hovers over the pause button.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with the Contributor role or higher can exploit this vulnerability by embedding the malicious shortcode in a post or page.
