The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Wholesale Market for WooCommerce" WordPress plugin, specifically related to arbitrary file download.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks proper authorization checks and fails to validate user-supplied input when generating file paths. This allows attackers to manipulate the path and download arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users in versions prior to 1.0.7.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input used in constructing file paths.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the required privileges to access the requested file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Attackers can download sensitive files from the server, including configuration files (e.g., `wp-config.php`), potentially exposing database credentials and other sensitive information.
*   Exposure of sensitive information can lead to further attacks, such as complete compromise of the website and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP GET requests to specific admin-ajax.php or admin-post.php endpoints with manipulated `ced_cwsm_log_download` parameters.
*   For versions before 1.0.7, the attack can be performed unauthenticated.
*   For 1.0.7 the vulnerability can still be exploited by high privilege users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Unauthenticated attacker can exploit versions prior to 1.0.7.
*   For version 1.0.7 and later, a high privilege user account (e.g. admin) is required.
*   Basic understanding of HTTP requests and URL parameters.
