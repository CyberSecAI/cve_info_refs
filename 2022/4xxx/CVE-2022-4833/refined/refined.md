**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "YourChannel" does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper input validation and output sanitization of shortcode attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious shortcode with a crafted payload in one of the shortcode attributes.
- This payload is stored in the database and executed when the page containing the shortcode is rendered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a WordPress account with at least the "Contributor" role, allowing them to create or edit content (posts, pages) and add shortcodes.
