## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MediaElement.js – HTML5 Video & Audio Player <= 4.2.8 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high-privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. Insert the following shortcode in a post/page: [mejsvideo type='" src="" onerror="alert(1)"']
2. Browse the post/page, and the alert will trigger successfully.
