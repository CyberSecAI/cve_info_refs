Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The ND Shortcodes plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization and output escaping of shortcode attributes.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website, which will be executed when a user views the page/post containing the crafted shortcode. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Defacing websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by embedding specially crafted shortcodes within a page or post.
    *   Specifically, shortcodes with attributes such as `nd_options_class` and `nd_options_color` were exploited.
    *   The WPBakery Page Builder plugin is required to initialize the vulnerable shortcodes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit content with the vulnerable shortcodes.

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to inject JavaScript code using shortcode attributes:

```
[nd_options_team nd_options_class='"onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)//"']
[nd_options_team nd_options_color='"onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)//"']
[nd_options_testimonial nd_options_class='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;"']
[nd_options_testimonial nd_options_color='"onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)//"']
```

These examples show how the `onmouseover` event can be used to execute JavaScript `alert(/XSS/)`, and style attributes can also be manipulated.

The vulnerability affects versions of the ND Shortcodes plugin prior to 7.0.
