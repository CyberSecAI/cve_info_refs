Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Elementor plugin's lightbox feature does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided URLs when loading them into an iframe. Specifically, the code checks for `vimeo.com` or `youtube.com` URLs but does not prevent other URLs from being loaded as iframe `src` attribute values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Iframe Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary iframes by crafting a malicious URL with the `elementor-action:action=lightbox` parameter and a `settings` parameter containing a `url` value.
- **Lack of input validation/sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly validate and sanitize the URL provided in the `settings` parameter of the `lightbox` action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS):** The primary impact is the ability to inject malicious iframes into the page. This can be used for various malicious purposes, such as:
    - **Phishing:** Displaying a fake login page or other malicious content within the iframe.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to a site that downloads malware.
    - **Clickjacking:** Overlaying a transparent iframe over legitimate content to trick users into performing unintended actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that uses the `elementor-action:action=lightbox` parameter with a malicious URL in the `settings` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with the malicious payload and convince a user to access it. The user doesn't need any specific privileges on the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Elementor versions prior to 3.5.5.
- The fix, as shown in the provided GitHub commit, ensures that a video is only played if it has a registered provider, likely preventing the usage of arbitrary URLs.

- The vulnerability is classified as a Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS) issue and is related to OWASP's A1: Injection and CWE-80.
- The CVSS score is 4.3, considered Medium severity.
