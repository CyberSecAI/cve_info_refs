- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Users with a role as low as a contributor can perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks, which could be used against high-privilege users such as admins. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a malicious shortcode into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least "contributor" privileges. They must be able to create or edit posts/pages to insert the malicious shortcode.
