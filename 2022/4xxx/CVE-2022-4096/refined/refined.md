  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application was not properly validating the host of a URI, leading to the possibility of accessing internal resources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass intended restrictions and make requests to internal services or resources that should not be accessible from the outside, leading to information disclosure or other security breaches.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the URL or host in an API request.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the application's API with a manipulated URL or host."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The fix implemented includes adding a list of disallowed hosts, including `169.254.169.254` and `metadata.google.internal`, and checking the host against this list before making a request. The fix applies to both REST and GraphQL APIs. The changes also include updates to how the application resolves hostnames to ensure that disallowed hosts cannot be bypassed using IP addresses. This is done by performing checks against both the host name and its resolved IP address."
