Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) filtering on multiple parameters within the `AttributeSetFilter` class. Specifically, the `setWatermarkAttribute` method does not sanitize user-provided input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The application is susceptible to XSS attacks. User-controlled parameters, meant for setting watermark attributes, are not sanitized before being used in the `commonHeader.ftl` template.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `AttributeSetFilter` fails to properly sanitize user input before it's used in templates that generate HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code through vulnerable parameters, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `watermarkXSpace` parameter of the `/picturesPreview` endpoint. Other parameters in `AttributeSetFilter` are also likely vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`/picturesPreview`) with malicious parameter values.
*   The attacker does not need any specific position other than being able to access the application.

**Technical Details**

*   The issue resides in `cn.keking.web.filter.AttributeSetFilter#setWatermarkAttribute` method.
*   The injected parameters are used in `src/main/resources/web/commonHeader.ftl`
*   `commonHeader.ftl` is used by other template files like `picture.ftl`
*   `picture.ftl` is used in `cn.keking.web.controller.OnlinePreviewController#picturesPreview` which makes the endpoint vulnerable to XSS

**Exploit Example:**
The following URL demonstrates the exploit:

```
/picturesPreview?urls=aHR0cDovLzE=&watermarkXSpace=1});}}alert(1);function a(){function b(){return ({//
```
This payload injects a JavaScript `alert(1)` when the page is rendered, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
The comments section suggests that the developers are aware of the issue and have taken the following steps:
*   HTML filtering is being implemented on watermark related parameters.
*   Character filtering (specifically {}) is being implemented

This vulnerability is indeed related to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability, and this content provides much more detail than a typical CVE description.
