The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4593.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data before it is displayed on the web pages. Specifically, the code was not escaping HTML special characters in various parts of the application, especially within the `cz.softinel.retra.core.utils.decorator` package.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to XSS because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in HTML pages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to:

*   Stealing session cookies.
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   Defacing the web application.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   Potentially gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts by supplying crafted data in various input fields, such as:
* Project names
* Component names
* User contact information fields (first name, last name, email, website, phone numbers, fax)
* Worklog descriptions
* Schedule comments
* Jira issue summaries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to provide input to the vulnerable application via its web interface. This could be done through a normal user account or in some cases through other interfaces that interact with the vulnerable endpoints.
