    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could manipulate certificate data to inject malicious LDAP filter components, potentially gaining control of an admin account and leading to a full domain takeover.",

      "The vulnerability can be exploited during PKINIT authentication, where the certificate data is used to construct LDAP filters for user mapping.",
        "An attacker can control certificate values."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to present a specially crafted certificate during PKINIT authentication and influence the content of the certificate data which is used in the mapping rules."

  "affected_component": "libsss_certmap in SSSD",
    "resolution": "The vulnerability is resolved by sanitizing certificate data before using it in LDAP filters.",
    "additional_notes": [
        "The issue was introduced in SSSD 1.15.3 (when libsss_certmap was introduced) and resolved in SSSD 2.3.1.",
