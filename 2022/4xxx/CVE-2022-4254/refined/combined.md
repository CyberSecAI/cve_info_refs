certmap: sanitize LDAP search filter

```
The sss_certmap_get_search_filter() will now sanitize the values read
from the certificates before adding them to a search filter. To be able
to get the plain values as well sss_certmap_expand_mapping_rule() is
added.

| Cloned from Pagure issue: <https://pagure.io/SSSD/sssd/issue/4180>   * Created at 2020-04-28 17:25:00 by [darkcipher](https://pagure.io/user/darkcipher) * Assigned to [sbose](https://pagure.io/user/sbose) * Associated bugzillas   + <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1780404>  ---   I'm having an issue getting a maprule to work properly. It looks like sssd isn't sanitizing certificate attributes prior to issuing the ldap search. In this example, parentheses in the Subject DN are causing an ldap search error "Bad search filter." At the end of the example, I show the Bad search filter result from sssd and a working ldapsearch with backslash-escaped parentheses.  Additionally, altSecurityIdentities in LDAP stores a space between UID (OID...) and CN. AD is able to find and match the certificate to user when the Certificate uses a + to separate these values. I don't know if this is a standard transformation or if sssd could support a user-configurable transformation like `!ad` for certain character adjustments?

It looks your certificate has a multi-valued RDN which is allowed for PIV cards as described in <https://www.idmanagement.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/1171/uploads/Common-Policy-Framework.pdf> (search for 'multi-value').  According to <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4514> the components of a multi-valued RDN should be concatenated with the reserved character '+'.  What I'm currently missing is an explanation why AD does not use the '+' here but a space.  Btw, according to <https://piv.idmanagement.gov/networkconfig/accounts/> the 'CN' part should come first followed by the 'OID' part which is different in your case. But according to <https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-16-21404> section 4.1.1 both versions might be used.  bye, Sumit   ---   **Comment from [darkcipher](https://pagure.io/user/darkcipher) at [2020-04-29 17:37:06](https://pagure.io/SSSD/sssd/issue/4180#645045)**  Yes, it's a multi-valued RDN (or Multi AVA) as defined in RFC4514 Section 2. Microsoft says they "support" RFC4514 Section 2 by defining MAX=1 [MS-ADTS Ref](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/3c96b56d-d7a7-46f1-9883-7d031f9fa01e). To me, this means they don't. I think they may just concatenate the multi-values with a space separator. The LDAP servers I'm using have the two values for altSecurityIdentities X509:... one with UID followed by CN, another with CN followed by UID, since LDAP doesn't guarantee order ... in LDAP's world, they are attributes, in MS-AD, they only support one, so concatenate.  ``` altSecurityIdentities: X509:<I>C=US,O=Entrust,OU=Certification Authorities,OU=Entrust Managed Services SSP CA<S>C=US,O=U.S. Government,OU=Department of Authentication,OID.0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1=1337 CN=JOHN GALT (Affiliate) altSecurityIdentities: X509:<I>C=US,O=Entrust,OU=Certification Authorities,OU=Entrust Managed Services SSP CA<S>C=US,O=U.S. Government,OU=Department of Authentication,CN=JOHN GALT (Affiliate) OID.0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1=1337  ``` |

| I am running into this same issue, also having to do with parentheses in CNs when dealing with U.S. government smart cards. I'm going to have to configure FreeIPA to match on full certificates for now and revert back to using certmap data once this PR is merged. |

There is currently a bug in sssd where it does not properly escape
parentheses in the certificate subject when performing an LDAP query.
See these links for more about this bug:
* https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/issues/5135
* https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/pull/1036

This bug inhibits us from matching on user certmap data in the case of
contractors, whose CNs contain the text \"(affiliate)\".  Hence we
require two certmap rules: one for certificates whose CNs contain
parentheses (e.g. contractor certificates) and therefore must match on
the full certificate, and one for certificates whose CNs do not
contain parentheses (e.g. fed certificates) and therefore can match on
user certmap data.  It is preferable to match on user certmap data,
since it should change less often than the full certificate.

Once the sssd pull request mentioned above is approved, merged, and
appears in a release, we should be able to use a single certmap rule
for all users that leverages the user certmap data.")`

Package        : sssd
Version        : 1.16.3-3.2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16838 CVE-2019-3811 CVE-2021-3621 CVE-2022-4254
Debian Bug     : 919051 931432 992710

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in sssd, a set of daemons to manage
access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms, which could
lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16838

    It was discovered that when the Group Policy Objects (GPO) are not
    readable by SSSD due to a too strict permission settings on the
    server side, SSSD allows all authenticated users to login instead of
    denying access.

    A new boolean setting ‘ad_gpo_ignore_unreadable’ (defaulting to
    False) is introduced for environments where attributes in the
    groupPolicyContainer are not readable and changing the permissions
    on the GPO objects is not possible or desirable.  See sssd-ad(5).

CVE-2019-3811

    It was discovered that if a user was configured with no home
    directory set, then sssd(8) returns ‘/’ (i.e., the root directory)
    instead of the empty string (meaning no home directory).  This could
    impact services that restrict the user's filesystem access to within
    their home directory through chroot() or similar.

CVE-2021-3621

    It was discovered that the sssctl(8) command was vulnerable to shell
    command injection via the ‘logs-fetch’ and ‘cache-expire’
    subcommands.

    This flaw could allows an attacker to trick the root user into
    running a specially crafted sssctl(8) command, such as via sudo, in
    order to gain root privileges.

CVE-2022-4254

    It was discovered that libsss_certmap failed to sanitize certificate
    data used in LDAP filters.

    PKINIT enables a client to authenticate to the KDC using an X.509
    certificate and the corresponding private key, rather than a
    passphrase or keytab.  Mapping rules are used in order to map the
    certificate presented during a PKINIT authentication request to the
    corresponding principal.  However the mapping filter was found to be
    vulnerable to LDAP filter injection.  As the search result is be
    influenced by values in the certificate, which may be attacker
    controlled, this flaw could allow an attacker to gain control of the
    admin account, leading to full domain takeover.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.16.3-3.2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sssd packages.

For the detailed security status of sssd please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sssd>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2149894#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2022-12-01 10:45:17 UTC  ``` FreeIPA supports the Kerberos PKINIT protocol extension (RFC 4556). PKINIT enables a client to authenticate to the KDC using an X.509 certificate and the corresonding private key, rather than a passphrase or keytab. FreeIPA uses mapping rules to map a certificate presented during a PKINIT authentication request to the corresponding principal. The mapping filter is vulnerable to LDAP filter injection. The search result can be influenced by values in the certificate, which may be attacker controlled. In the most extreme case, an attacker could gain control of the admin account, leading to full domain takeover.   FreeIPA is not vulnerable in its default configuration.  The problem is in libsss_certmap, which is part of SSSD. FreeIPA servers use this library in ipa_kdb Kerberos plugin implementation.   The issue was introduced in SSSD 1.15.3 (when libsss_certmap was introduced) and resolved in SSSD 2.3.1.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=2149894#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-01-24 08:45:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2023:0397 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0397](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A0397)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=2149894#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-01-24 10:10:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2023:0403 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0403](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A0403)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=2149894#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-01-24 15:11:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2023:0442 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0442](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A0442)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=2149894#c31)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-01-26 22:52:10 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
