The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4243.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress ImageInject plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful attack would allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This can lead to various impacts including session hijacking, account compromise, and defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a crafted POST request to the plugin's settings page (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wpdf-options) with malicious JavaScript code in the `advanced_img_template` , `advanced_attr_template` or `advanced_attr_template_multi` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (or equivalent high privilege) on the WordPress site in order to modify the plugin's settings. The attacker does not require the unfiltered\_html capability.
