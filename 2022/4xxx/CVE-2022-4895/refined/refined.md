The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-4895.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is described as a "Man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability". The specific technical details of the vulnerability are not provided in this document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is that the software is susceptible to a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This suggests a lack of proper encryption or validation of data exchanged between the affected products and other systems.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to the following impacts:
- **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information (High impact)
- **Integrity compromise:**  Modification of data in transit (Low impact)
- **Availability impact:** Possible disruption of services (Low impact)

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the affected software and other systems it communicates with. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system (PR:N), nor does it require any user interaction (UI:N). The attacker only needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic.
