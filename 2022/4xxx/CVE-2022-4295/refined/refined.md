- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a logged-in user's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, including gaining administrative control.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the `post_type` parameter of the `admin-ajax.php` request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be logged in. A user simply needs to visit the crafted URL. The attacker needs the ability to make the victim visit the crafted URL.
