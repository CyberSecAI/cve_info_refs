Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input, specifically the "alias" field associated with user bookings, which allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code. This occurs when the application displays the alias without escaping HTML entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript code entered in the "booked to" field (or alias field) is executed in the context of other users viewing the booking information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of other users viewing the booking information or related user panel.
- Session hijacking: The injected script can steal cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and account compromise.
- Phishing: An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website or display fake forms to steal credentials.
- Information theft: An attacker might access and exfiltrate sensitive user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input injection: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "alias" field during a booking process.
- Reflected execution: The injected script is executed when other users view the booking details or the user panel where the alias is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to make bookings or modify user aliases. This suggests that the attacker needs to be authenticated.
- The attacker doesn't need to be an administrator to perform the attack. However, the impact on admin users is explicitly mentioned.
- The attack occurs when the booking information or the user panel is rendered, meaning the attacker's payload is executed on other users browsers.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by escaping HTML characters using `escapeHtml()` before rendering the `alias` field in the different view templates (PHP files). This was implemented in commit `ef49e709c8adecc3a83cdc6164a67162991d2213`.
- The issue was reported by user `Tobischlick` and resolved by `tkrebs`.
- The fix was included in version `1.8.0`.
