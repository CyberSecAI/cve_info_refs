- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected page or post. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:**  By crafting a malicious shortcode (e.g., `[logo-slider border='yes' bordercolor='red" onmouseover="alert(1)"']`) and embedding it in a post/page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor role on the WordPress site to add the malicious shortcode.
