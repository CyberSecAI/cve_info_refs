## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YouTube Channel < 3.23.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. Set a YouTube Data API Key in YouTube Channel Settings. You can enter any invalid random string as an API key.
2. Insert the following shortcode into a post/page:
[youtube\_channel channel=UCRPqmcpGcJ\_gFtTmN\_a4aVA link\_to=vanity class='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']

### Affects Plugins
