VULNERABLE FIRMWARE VERIFICATION

Date

5 December 2022, Version 1.0

Sensitivity

TLP:GREEN

Relevance

SPRECON-E-C/-E-P/-E-T3:

affected

SPRECON-V460:

not affected

Description

A vulnerable firmware verification in the firmware of the SPRECON-E product range
has been identified. Through physical access and hardware manipulation, an
attacker might be able to bypass hardware-based code verification and thus inject
arbitrary code.

Affected Product:
SPRECON-E-C/P/T3 CPU modules of following variants: PU244x

Solution
Sprecher Automation will address this vulnerability by providing firmware updates
together with improved boot loaders. We will inform once new firmware is available.

Mitigation
The access vector is bound to physical device access. Hence, it is recommended to
emphasize physical security controls. See general recommendations.
Besides this, it needs to be taken into account that necessary hardware manipulation
to fully exploit this vulnerability requires to put the device out of operation for several
time; i.e. device status monitoring as usually applied in substation automation is an
important measure to also detect potential attacks.

General Recommendations
Sprecher Automation strongly recommends to emphasize security best practices in
critical infrastructures such as e.g. measures according to ISO/IEC 27019. Hence,
both network as well as physical access to OT devices need to be restricted to a
minimum, while protecting and monitoring all access means.
Also, engineering / remote maintenance infrastructure needs to be protected with
high security in mind, as potentially sensitive configuration data or maintenance
access credentials could be stored there.

HARDENING NOTIFICATION: SPRECON MAINTENANCE ACCESS WITH HARDCODED
CREDENTIALS

Date

Sensitivity

TLP:GREEN

SPRECON-E-C/-E-P/-E-T3:

SPRECON-V460:

not affected

Description

SPRECON-E devices offer the ability to enable maintenance logins; these
maintenance logins use static credentials that are only known to limited Sprecher
staff but shall only be enabled by the device owner in case of explicit necessity.
According to Sprecher's hardening guidelines, these accounts shall be disabled for
operation. Disabling can be done via normal configuration access which in turn shall
be secured with SPRECON’s RBAC (role-based access control).
This information is meant to again put attention to this hardening measure.
It is recommended to check if maintenance access is disabled. Additionally, access
to devices’ configuration files that are stored on engineering PC systems shall be
limited and monitored. Overall, SPRECON hardening guidelines are always
recommended to be implemented in case this has not been done so far.

In a coming firmware release, device owners will additionally have the ability to gain
more control over these user accounts by not only being able to disable them, but
also by setting individual credentials in case their usage is necessary.
The maintenance user accounts are equipped with limited privileges and e.g. do not
have access to stored keys in the device.

Affected Product:
SPRECON-E CPU modules of following variants:

-  PU243x, PU244x
-  MC33/34
-  SPRECON-EDIR

General Recommendations
Sprecher Automation strongly recommends to emphasize security best practices in
critical infrastructures such as e.g. measures according to ISO/IEC 27019. Hence,
both network as well as physical access to OT devices need to be restricted to a
minimum, while protecting and monitoring all access means.
Also, engineering / remote maintenance infrastructure needs to be protected with
high security in mind, as potentially sensitive configuration data or maintenance
access credentials could be stored there.
