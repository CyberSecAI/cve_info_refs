- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Breadcrumb plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation and output sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions performed within the user's browser, potentially impacting high-privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the shortcode attribute `themes`, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code through a crafted shortcode, such as `[breadcrumb themes='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']` .
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site.
