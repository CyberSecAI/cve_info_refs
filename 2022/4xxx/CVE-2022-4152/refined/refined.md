- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `option_id` POST parameter is not sanitized before being concatenated into an SQL query within the `edit-options.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leak sensitive information from the WordPress site's database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`, specifically targeting the `option_id` parameter with malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs at least author-level privileges on the WordPress site.
