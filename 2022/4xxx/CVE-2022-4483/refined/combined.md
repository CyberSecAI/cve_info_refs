## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Insert Pages < 3.7.5 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit: [insert page="2" class="' onmouseover='alert(1)'"]
Note: page id should be different from the current page id.

### Affects Plugins
