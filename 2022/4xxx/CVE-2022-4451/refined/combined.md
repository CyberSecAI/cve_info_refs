## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Sassy Social Share < 3.3.45 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Insert the following shortcode in a post/page:
[Sassy\_Follow\_Icons social\_networks="facebook" width='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
The XSS will be triggered when previewing/viewing the post/page and moving the Mose over the Facebook icon

### Affects Plugins

Fixed in 3.3.45
