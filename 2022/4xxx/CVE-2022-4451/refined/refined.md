- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sassy Social Share plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers, including those with high privileges like administrators. This can lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a crafted shortcode containing malicious JavaScript into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor level access to WordPress to create or edit posts/pages containing the malicious shortcode.
