### Need help?

Before opening a new issue, did you ask your question on

* [Google group](https://groups.google.com/group/testng-users)
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/testng)

If you posted on both sites, please provide the link to the other question to avoid duplicating the answer.

### Are you sure it is a TestNG bug?

Before posting the issue, try to reproduce the issue in [a shell window](https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#running-testng).

If the problem does not exist with the shell, first check if the issue exists on the bugtracker of the runner, and open an issue there first:

* Eclipse :[Issues Page](https://github.com/cbeust/testng-eclipse/issues)
* IntelliJ:[Issues Page](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues?q=Subsystem:%20%7BJava.%20Tests.%20TestNG%7D)
* Maven :[Issues Page](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE)
* Gradle :[Issues Page](https://issues.gradle.org/projects/GRADLE)

### Which version are you using?

Always make sure your issue is happening on the latest TestNG version. Bug reports occurring on older versions will not be looked at quickly.

### Have you considered sending a pull request instead of filing an issue?

The best way to report a bug is to provide the TestNG team with a full test case reproducing the issue.
Maybe you can write a runnable test case (check the `src/test/` folder for examples) and propose it in a pull request
Don't worry if the CI fails because it is the expected behavior.
This pull request will be a perfect start to find the fix :)

### How to create a pull request?

Refer our [Contributing](/testng-team/testng/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) section for detailed set of steps.

### We encourage pull requests that:

* Add new features to TestNG (or)
* Fix bugs in TestNG

If your pull request involves fixing SonarQube issues then we would suggest that you please discuss this with the
[TestNG-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/testng-dev) before you spend time working on it.

| Hi,  I see a need of release TestNg more frequently, Today it seems to be 6-9 month between the releases. And the number of features included in TestNg is kind of big, In our project we do releases for every commit, which allow fast feed back. And in our project we have restriction on using forks.  The risk I see now is if we find a bug in a release we need to wait very long time until next release, and then there is a risk that something else have changed.  Maybe a release every quarter wouldn't create to much extra job for your team.  What do you think? |

| [@martinaldrin](https://github.com/martinaldrin) - The frequency of a release is usually determined by what is getting shipped in a particular release. Today the rate at which issues are getting fixed is pretty slow, for lack of enough folks to help out. We would love to do more frequent releases, but we also need to ensure that we dont end up doing a release which contains a very small set of bug fixes/features.  What is the minimum number of issues which would warrant a release, this can be debated. But this primarily one of the main reasons behind elongated timelines between releases. |

| [@krmahadevan](https://github.com/krmahadevan) I think it's perfectly fine to ship minor version releases more frequently even if they only contain a handful of bug fixes.  The way I set things up in the Maven repo and github should make it trivial for you and [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) to deploy to Maven at any time, let's try to do that more frequently. |

| That would be very helpful, and I think that will benefit both developers and users. You will get much faster feedback on the releases if a new issues is introduced.  It is always easier to correct bugs when the code is fresh, correcting bugs that was introduced 9 month ago can be much more tricky since the code might have changed and might be affected by other code commits.  I also believe that if you need to dig into code changes that was implemented long time ago will require more effort compare to something that was recently implemented. |

[@cbeust](https://github.com/cbeust) Yes. I agree. Just that our few handle of bug fixes are also only trickling in, and not flowing in :) Hence the elongated time.  The way I set things up in the Maven repo and github should make it trivial for you and [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) to deploy to Maven at any time, let's try to do that more frequently.  Yep. This would be the first time we are going to be doing a release after the overhaul of our gradle build. Will setup sometime for this two couple of issues which [@martinaldrin](https://github.com/martinaldrin) is focussing on gets resolved so that he and the others can basically start using `7.5.0` (or) whatever that version is going to be. |

But like I mentioned, we are short of hands on helping with bug fixes. Currently its mostly just me and [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) and sometimes it gets difficult to time slice between OSS and your day job. That's the only reason why we have elongated releases. With support of folks like you in terms of helping out with bug fixes etc on TestNG, I am confident that we can get this sorted out pretty easily. |

| Great, many thanks for the fast release!  A question, the tag is named 7.6.0-rc1, is that correct and the release is 7.6.0? <https://github.com/cbeust/testng/tags>  The reason why the tag is important for us is because our FOSS handling requires that we point out the source of the release. and now it is a missmatch between the release and the source |

| Always when I see other projects releasing candidates there is a mapping between the version and the tag. But I treat 7.6.0 as final release and 7.6.0-rc1 as a candidate of 7.6.0. So I do not understand this. If you planned to release a candidate rc1, then I expect the version in maven central to be named rc1 as well and not 7.6.0 |

Yes the tag is correct.  that does not make any sense at all, So there is no official release, its just release candidate? or is the rc1 referring to a different commit than what 7.6.0 is based on? which commit is 7.6.0 based on?  The gradle plugin that we are using adds that as a tag because it attempts at doing release candidates.  That is fine but a release candidate is not a release, its a **candidate** to become a release, you should probably still tag the release commit with the release number. a release candidate and and a release can be the same commit which has two tags. were the release tag is added first when the release candidate is proven to be stable and good enough to become a offical release. |

| [@Elisedlund-ericsson](https://github.com/Elisedlund-ericsson)  That is fine, and big thanks for the release. sorry if i have sounded pushy or negative.  Given the fact that I juggle around with a lot of things, apart from taking care of TestNG stuff, it would be good if you could please give it some time (at least 24 hours). I am still trying to come to terms with the Gradle plugin that we are using to do releases and understand what all it does internally. So I may be a bit rusty.  But we cannot register it in any FOSS handling software's we have, (for handling licenses and vulnerabilities etc) as it requires mapping between Artifact and commit/tag. that prevents us to use the release in an official manner  Thanks for adding this context. I have created a new tag [7.6.0](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/tree/7.6.0) which also tracks the same commit as [7.6.0-rc1](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/releases/tag/7.6.0-rc1) as can be seen [here](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/tags) |

| I think there should be bug fix releases, 7.6.1 for example. That means the branching model should change as well, not just releasing process.  We wouldn't be needing a branching model because we aren't running parallel releases. Its trunk based development model. So the pom file gets updated with whatever version. For e.g.,   * if its a bugfix release only `z` gets changed in `x.y.z` * if its a minor release we change `y` in `x.y.z` and * if its a major release we change `x` |

| We dont have release branches because at any point in time we would like to target for only 1 release. What that release would be (Major/minor/bugfix) is something that we decide at that point in time.  I believe we are following <https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/release-from-trunk/> I have seen other projects such as Selenium project also follow the `release-from-trunk` approach and not create `release` branches.  We have just the `master` branch from which we release at any given point in time. Post that, the `master` branch gets tagged. I am personally not in favour of making the release process complicated with introducing release branches which gets cherry-picked etc., because its going to take time in getting it done.  The `branch-for-release` I think would work when you want to deploy an artifact into an environment which gets executed (for e.g., a microservice that gets deployed into an environment).  For libraries I think its fine to follow `release-from-trunk` |

| Considering there is a CVE fixed on master branch would it make sense to release a 7.6.2 (or 7.7.0) <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4065>  I surprised such a serious commit did not immediate new release.  What happened with more frequent releases? Now there's huge amount of commits piled up and even if you do a release now, we risk that there is some other change that will prevent us from uplifting to the new release forcing us to either:   1. Live with or workaround the new issues 2. Keep using old TestNG version with the CVE 3. Having to create a fork with on the old release with the CVE patch released |

| Can you please help vet out this below release candidate  Yes we can forsure test it, We even tested latest TestNG master mid November already.

Thanks for the great efforts,  Do you have suggestions on how to make it better?  TestNG does not have a a lot of contributors.

That explains the lag in the release.  How I usually do it and how I prefer is when every commit gets released. then automatically uplifted and used. that way if there's a problem you run into it very quick and also it narrows it down to just a one or a few commits that could have caused the issue, and the person that did the change usually problem area still left in his recent memory.  basically test/use everything as early as possible and fail as fast as possible.  I'm fine with a release containing a major backwards compatibility issues sometimes so it can be identified as early as possible to then either be fixed/discussed or handled at the user side(migrated)  Doing it like above however means that the release process has to be **fully** automated. Even preferably with acceptance testing from end users included. Like us (or other big users like OpenJDK(i think?))  Maybe a more sane or reasonable first step is to make a new release like ever ~3-5 small commits or every time there is a big/important commit. of course we already test a SNAPSHOT version this often, but we rather want use a release in our production this often |

Just that the triggering part is manual. Do you have a bunch of acceptance tests that you can share, which we can try to incorporate and build some sort of an automated way of getting this done ?  Basically for every SNAPSHOT publishing that goes into Maven Central snapshot repository, this project's build job would run having it consume the SNAPSHOT. TestNG build snapshot would be the upstream job and the acceptance test would be the downstream job.  of course we already test a SNAPSHOT version this often, but we rather want use a release in our production this often  If you can share a bunch of acceptance tests, that can be used as a vetting out process, we can perhaps have it setup to be built after every merge to master, which publishes a snapshot version. That way, for every commit the acceptance tests are already checking if all is well. |

Everything I know of is closed source unfortunately. but basically its like your current process except that there is no manual triggering instead it runs the release flow on every commit, Then consumers(users) has CI to auto uplift to the new release and run tests, given any failures it would then report back to the origin project.

That way, for every commit the acceptance tests are already checking if all is well.  Probably not that much that we can share (as in code) :( and if we have something general enough it could as well just be contributed unit/integration tests merged to TestNG itself, stuff like: <https://github.com/cbeust/testng/pull/2712/files#diff-72c2d0dc194a0c36f76620fbc687e4627fa52d80619f22ce400c6116ce809126> )  (Our testing is more in the nature of uplifting latest TestNG and running with all our know working "product" tests to see if something that worked previously instead now fails)  The final results of our integration/acceptance testing of TestNG can probably be shared however in some automated way. Like posting an Issue in Github that SNAPSHOT X causes compatibility failures, then of course we would have to make an analysis of our internal closed logs / tc fails to pin point the exact issue and provide stacktraces. |

Are you suggesting that we release a version to Maven Central for every commit ? I don't think I quite understand this part, because our release process essentially releases the artifact into Maven Central (We first publish release candidates into staging area, which would wait there to be released or dropped). If we drop it from a staging area it means that we are discarding that release candidate, if we release it, then it means it gets published to Maven Central. [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) any idea on this ?  The straight forward way that I can think of is that, you folks have a dedicated job internally that consumes TestNG snapshot dependency and runs your evaluations on it and report back any breakages back to us on the snapshot so that it can be fixed. I dont see a different way of doing this, if there are no acceptance tests that can be shared. |

| I don't see any advantage to make a release on every commit. Here, we are not building a huge product that suffers from the synchronization of teams.  If you really want a release from every commit, you can use <https://jitpack.io> as a maven repository or you can make your own release process on a synchronized fork you manage. |

| I added staging and bumped to 7.7.0 (we were previously on 7.6.1), and did a full rebuild.  No problems noted.  Our use of testng is pretty basic, and certainly wouldn't have tested every capability. It is probably reasonably representative of a lot of other projects though. |

All test so far have been fine, like we tested on roughly 300+ repos(typical small OSS libraries) that does just typical unit testing.  However the more heavy stuff like function/system/integration testing we have however **not finished yet** which uses much more of TestNG like: every type of Listener and every annotation and many of the application parameters including -xmlPathInJar  I read an interesting comment in the same PR that basically questions the seriousness of this issue since the code path in question is related to a test jar mode of execution of TestNG. Details [here](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/pull/2806#issuecomment-1341767146)  I also don't fully agree with the seriousness of the issue either, Have a very hard time seeing any real world scenarios were it can be abused. in this case its more about company policies of using software with CVE and "management" not liking to see CVE: 7.8 HIGH as it looks bad. |

| [@Elisedlund-ericsson](https://github.com/Elisedlund-ericsson) -  However the more heavy stuff like function/system/integration testing we have however not finished yet which uses much more of TestNG like: every type of Listener and every annotation and many of the application parameters including -xmlPathInJar  Thanks for the inputs. Can you please tell me by when can we expect to hear back from you on the completeness of those tests as well? That way I would be able to wrap up the release part in time. Please let me know. Given the fact that there are now queries and apprehensions on the CVE, I don't want to stall the release more because now I will have to keep answering all those queries :) |

Given the fact that there are now queries and apprehensions on the CVE, I don't want to stall the release more because now I will have to keep answering all those queries :)  I actually don't know why it taking this long either, (and I'm not running it myself personally) I asked for ETA  From my perspective it ok if you go ahead and release right now. We did a complete test during mid November so the majority of the new commits(since 7.6.1) does not cause us any issues for us atleast. From the newer commits I cannot see anything I foresee as risky except possibly the "dependsOnMethods" commits which we rely on and that has caused us issues before. on the ~smaller chance of issues/failure we could instead look into a 7.7.1 so other users do not have to wait for a 7.7.0 |

# Welcome to CxWorkshops

Welcome to CxWorkshops, Checkmarx’s interactive labs for learning about and getting hands-on with Checkmarx products and solutions. Whether you’re an existing Checkmarx customer or evaluating Checkmarx for your application security needs, we have a lab for it!

These interactive labs are intended to be instructor or proctor-led, however the content is freely available, should you wish to try the labs in your own environment or in your own time.

When attending a virtual or in-person workshop, the proctor will provide an temporary API key to provision access to a Checkmarx One tenant. If you wish to try these labs on your own, you will need your own tenant and/or API key. To create an API key, see [Generating an API Key](https://checkmarx.com/resource/documents/en/34965-118315-authentication-for-checkmarx-one-cli.html#UUID-a4e31a96-1f36-6293-e95a-97b4b9189060_UUID-1e7abdfa-77eb-2a6c-f12a-c812a1e1dcf7)

| Hi,  I see a need of release TestNg more frequently, Today it seems to be 6-9 month between the releases. And the number of features included in TestNg is kind of big, In our project we do releases for every commit, which allow fast feed back. And in our project we have restriction on using forks.  The risk I see now is if we find a bug in a release we need to wait very long time until next release, and then there is a risk that something else have changed.  Maybe a release every quarter wouldn't create to much extra job for your team.  What do you think? |

| [@martinaldrin](https://github.com/martinaldrin) - The frequency of a release is usually determined by what is getting shipped in a particular release. Today the rate at which issues are getting fixed is pretty slow, for lack of enough folks to help out. We would love to do more frequent releases, but we also need to ensure that we dont end up doing a release which contains a very small set of bug fixes/features.  What is the minimum number of issues which would warrant a release, this can be debated. But this primarily one of the main reasons behind elongated timelines between releases. |

| [@krmahadevan](https://github.com/krmahadevan) I think it's perfectly fine to ship minor version releases more frequently even if they only contain a handful of bug fixes.  The way I set things up in the Maven repo and github should make it trivial for you and [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) to deploy to Maven at any time, let's try to do that more frequently. |

| That would be very helpful, and I think that will benefit both developers and users. You will get much faster feedback on the releases if a new issues is introduced.  It is always easier to correct bugs when the code is fresh, correcting bugs that was introduced 9 month ago can be much more tricky since the code might have changed and might be affected by other code commits.  I also believe that if you need to dig into code changes that was implemented long time ago will require more effort compare to something that was recently implemented. |

[@cbeust](https://github.com/cbeust) Yes. I agree. Just that our few handle of bug fixes are also only trickling in, and not flowing in :) Hence the elongated time.  The way I set things up in the Maven repo and github should make it trivial for you and [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) to deploy to Maven at any time, let's try to do that more frequently.  Yep. This would be the first time we are going to be doing a release after the overhaul of our gradle build. Will setup sometime for this two couple of issues which [@martinaldrin](https://github.com/martinaldrin) is focussing on gets resolved so that he and the others can basically start using `7.5.0` (or) whatever that version is going to be. |

[@martinaldrin](https://github.com/martinaldrin) - Trust me I would love to do more frequent releases (monthly or a quarterly). And I am not against that notion. But like I mentioned, we are short of hands on helping with bug fixes. Currently its mostly just me and [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) and sometimes it gets difficult to time slice between OSS and your day job. That's the only reason why we have elongated releases. With support of folks like you in terms of helping out with bug fixes etc on TestNG, I am confident that we can get this sorted out pretty easily. |

| Great, many thanks for the fast release!  A question, the tag is named 7.6.0-rc1, is that correct and the release is 7.6.0? <https://github.com/cbeust/testng/tags>  The reason why the tag is important for us is because our FOSS handling requires that we point out the source of the release. and now it is a missmatch between the release and the source |

| Always when I see other projects releasing candidates there is a mapping between the version and the tag. But I treat 7.6.0 as final release and 7.6.0-rc1 as a candidate of 7.6.0. So I do not understand this. If you planned to release a candidate rc1, then I expect the version in maven central to be named rc1 as well and not 7.6.0 |

Yes the tag is correct.  that does not make any sense at all, So there is no official release, its just release candidate? or is the rc1 referring to a different commit than what 7.6.0 is based on? which commit is 7.6.0 based on?  The gradle plugin that we are using adds that as a tag because it attempts at doing release candidates.  That is fine but a release candidate is not a release, its a **candidate** to become a release, you should probably still tag the release commit with the release number. a release candidate and and a release can be the same commit which has two tags. were the release tag is added first when the release candidate is proven to be stable and good enough to become a offical release. |

We can temporarily consume and test it. But we cannot register it in any FOSS handling software's we have, (for handling licenses and vulnerabilities etc) as it requires mapping between Artifact and commit/tag. that prevents us to use the release in an official manner |

| [@Elisedlund-ericsson](https://github.com/Elisedlund-ericsson)  That is fine, and big thanks for the release. sorry if i have sounded pushy or negative.  Given the fact that I juggle around with a lot of things, apart from taking care of TestNG stuff, it would be good if you could please give it some time (at least 24 hours). I am still trying to come to terms with the Gradle plugin that we are using to do releases and understand what all it does internally. So I may be a bit rusty.  But we cannot register it in any FOSS handling software's we have, (for handling licenses and vulnerabilities etc) as it requires mapping between Artifact and commit/tag. that prevents us to use the release in an official manner  Thanks for adding this context. I have created a new tag [7.6.0](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/tree/7.6.0) which also tracks the same commit as [7.6.0-rc1](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/releases/tag/7.6.0-rc1) as can be seen [here](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/tags) |

| I think there should be bug fix releases, 7.6.1 for example. That means the branching model should change as well, not just releasing process.  We wouldn't be needing a branching model because we aren't running parallel releases. Its trunk based development model. So the pom file gets updated with whatever version. For e.g.,   * if its a bugfix release only `z` gets changed in `x.y.z` * if its a minor release we change `y` in `x.y.z` and * if its a major release we change `x` |

| We dont have release branches because at any point in time we would like to target for only 1 release. What that release would be (Major/minor/bugfix) is something that we decide at that point in time.  I believe we are following <https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/release-from-trunk/> I have seen other projects such as Selenium project also follow the `release-from-trunk` approach and not create `release` branches.  We have just the `master` branch from which we release at any given point in time. Post that, the `master` branch gets tagged. I am personally not in favour of making the release process complicated with introducing release branches which gets cherry-picked etc., because its going to take time in getting it done.  The `branch-for-release` I think would work when you want to deploy an artifact into an environment which gets executed (for e.g., a microservice that gets deployed into an environment).  For libraries I think its fine to follow `release-from-trunk` |

| Considering there is a CVE fixed on master branch would it make sense to release a 7.6.2 (or 7.7.0) <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4065>  I surprised such a serious commit did not immediate new release.  What happened with more frequent releases? Now there's huge amount of commits piled up and even if you do a release now, we risk that there is some other change that will prevent us from uplifting to the new release forcing us to either:   1. Live with or workaround the new issues 2. Keep using old TestNG version with the CVE 3. Having to create a fork with on the old release with the CVE patch released |

| Can you please help vet out this below release candidate  Yes we can forsure test it, We even tested latest TestNG master mid November already. (which I guess went fine)  Because I was out of action for a couple of months owing to a medical emergency !  No worries, Prioritize health/family over work! Thanks for the great efforts,  Do you have suggestions on how to make it better?  TestNG does not have a a lot of contributors.

That explains the lag in the release.  How I usually do it and how I prefer is when every commit gets released. then automatically uplifted and used. that way if there's a problem you run into it very quick and also it narrows it down to just a one or a few commits that could have caused the issue, and the person that did the change usually problem area still left in his recent memory.  basically test/use everything as early as possible and fail as fast as possible.  I'm fine with a release containing a major backwards compatibility issues sometimes so it can be identified as early as possible to then either be fixed/discussed or handled at the user side(migrated)  Doing it like above however means that the release process has to be **fully** automated. Even preferably with acceptance testing from end users included. Like us (or other big users like OpenJDK(i think?))  Maybe a more sane or reasonable first step is to make a new release like ever ~3-5 small commits or every time there is a big/important commit. of course we already test a SNAPSHOT version this often, but we rather want use a release in our production this often |

Even preferably with acceptance testing from end users included. Like us (or other big users like OpenJDK(i think?))  The release process is already automated. Just that the triggering part is manual. Do you have a bunch of acceptance tests that you can share, which we can try to incorporate and build some sort of an automated way of getting this done ?  Basically for every SNAPSHOT publishing that goes into Maven Central snapshot repository, this project's build job would run having it consume the SNAPSHOT. TestNG build snapshot would be the upstream job and the acceptance test would be the downstream job.  of course we already test a SNAPSHOT version this often, but we rather want use a release in our production this often  If you can share a bunch of acceptance tests, that can be used as a vetting out process, we can perhaps have it setup to be built after every merge to master, which publishes a snapshot version. That way, for every commit the acceptance tests are already checking if all is well. |

Everything I know of is closed source unfortunately. but basically its like your current process except that there is no manual triggering instead it runs the release flow on every commit, Then consumers(users) has CI to auto uplift to the new release and run tests, given any failures it would then report back to the origin project.

That way, for every commit the acceptance tests are already checking if all is well.  Probably not that much that we can share (as in code) :( and if we have something general enough it could as well just be contributed unit/integration tests merged to TestNG itself, stuff like: <https://github.com/cbeust/testng/pull/2712/files#diff-72c2d0dc194a0c36f76620fbc687e4627fa52d80619f22ce400c6116ce809126> )  (Our testing is more in the nature of uplifting latest TestNG and running with all our know working "product" tests to see if something that worked previously instead now fails)  The final results of our integration/acceptance testing of TestNG can probably be shared however in some automated way. Like posting an Issue in Github that SNAPSHOT X causes compatibility failures, then of course we would have to make an analysis of our internal closed logs / tc fails to pin point the exact issue and provide stacktraces. |

Are you suggesting that we release a version to Maven Central for every commit ? I don't think I quite understand this part, because our release process essentially releases the artifact into Maven Central (We first publish release candidates into staging area, which would wait there to be released or dropped). If we drop it from a staging area it means that we are discarding that release candidate, if we release it, then it means it gets published to Maven Central. [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) any idea on this ?  The straight forward way that I can think of is that, you folks have a dedicated job internally that consumes TestNG snapshot dependency and runs your evaluations on it and report back any breakages back to us on the snapshot so that it can be fixed. I dont see a different way of doing this, if there are no acceptance tests that can be shared. |

| I don't see any advantage to make a release on every commit. Here, we are not building a huge product that suffers from the synchronization of teams.  If you really want a release from every commit, you can use <https://jitpack.io> as a maven repository or you can make your own release process on a synchronized fork you manage. |

For pgjdbc, we settled on back-porting security fix to all past versions till 42.2.x (42.2.0 has been released ~5 years ago, and 42.2.x is the latest version that still supports Java 1.6 and 1.7). For instance, a recent [GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h "GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h") has been fixed in four versions 42.2.27, 42.3.8, 42.4.3, 42.5.1, even though, the versions are most likely compatible. The users would most likely upgrade from 42.2 to 42.5 without any issues, however, we decouple "urgent upgrade needed for CVE resolution" from "upgrade for fixing bugs/adding features".  One of the reasons we do patch releases for past versions is that Spring Boot has a policy that they do not upgrade across "major" versions no matter what, so if a certain Spring Boot version uses pgjdbc 42.3.x, then that Spring Boot will use 42.3.x only.

| I added staging and bumped to 7.7.0 (we were previously on 7.6.1), and did a full rebuild.  No problems noted.  Our use of testng is pretty basic, and certainly wouldn't have tested every capability. It is probably reasonably representative of a lot of other projects though. |

All test so far have been fine, like we tested on roughly 300+ repos(typical small OSS libraries) that does just typical unit testing.  However the more heavy stuff like function/system/integration testing we have however **not finished yet** which uses much more of TestNG like: every type of Listener and every annotation and many of the application parameters including -xmlPathInJar  I read an interesting comment in the same PR that basically questions the seriousness of this issue since the code path in question is related to a test jar mode of execution of TestNG.

We did a complete test during mid November so the majority of the new commits(since 7.6.1) does not cause us any issues for us atleast. From the newer commits I cannot see anything I foresee as risky except possibly the "dependsOnMethods" commits which we rely on and that has caused us issues before. on the ~smaller chance of issues/failure we could instead look into a 7.7.1 so other users do not have to wait for a 7.7.0 |

# Security Vulnerability Fix

This pull request fixes a Zip Slip vulnerability either due to an insufficient, or missing guard when unzipping zip files.

Even if you deem, as the maintainer of this project, this is not necessarily fixing a security vulnerability, it is still, most likely, a valid security hardening.

## Preamble

### Impact

This issue allows a malicious zip file to potentially break out of the expected destination directory, writing contents into arbitrary locations on the file system.

Overwriting certain files/directories could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution on a target system by exploiting this vulnerability.

### Why?

The best description of Zip-Slip can be found in the white paper published by Snyk: [Zip Slip Vulnerability](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability)

#### But I had a guard in place, why wasn't it sufficient?

If the changes you see are a change to the guard, not the addition of a new guard, this is probably because this code contains a Zip-Slip vulnerability due to a partial path traversal vulnerability.

To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `"/usr/outnot".startsWith("/usr/out")`.

The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.

It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.

For example, on Linux, `println(new File("/var"))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File("/var", "/")` will print `/var/`;

however, `println(new File("/var", "/").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.

### The Fix

Implementing a guard comparing paths with the method `java.nio.files.Path#startsWith` will adequately protect against this vulnerability.

For example: `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)` or `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY_FILE.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`

# ➡️ Vulnerability Disclosure ⬅️

👋 Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!

First question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!

1. Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!
2. Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!

For partial path traversal, consider if user-supplied input could ever flow to this logic. If user-supplied input could reach this conditional, it's insufficient and, as such, most likely a vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Disclosure How-To

You have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:

1. Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.
2. Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the Snyk's Disclosure Email. Note: Please include `JLLeitschuh Disclosure` in the subject of your email so it is not missed.

## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities

You can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).

I'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.

## Source

This contribution was automatically generated with an [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) [refactoring recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/), which was lovingly handcrafted to bring this security fix to your repository.

The source code that generated this PR can be found here:

[Zip Slip](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/ZipSlip.java)

## Why didn't you disclose privately (ie. coordinated disclosure)?

This PR was automatically generated, in-bulk, and sent to this project as well as many others, all at the same time.

This is technically what is called a "Full Disclosure" in vulnerability disclosure, and I agree it's less than ideal. If GitHub offered a way to create private pull requests to submit pull requests, I'd leverage it, but that infrastructure, sadly, doesn't exist yet.

The problem is that, as an open source software security researcher, I (exactly like open source maintainers), I only have so much time in a day. I'm able to find vulnerabilities impacting hundreds, or sometimes thousands of open source projects with tools like GitHub Code Search and CodeQL. The problem is that my knowledge of vulnerabilities doesn't scale very well.

Individualized vulnerability disclosure takes time and care. It's a long and tedious process, and I have a significant amount of experience with it (I have over 50 CVEs to my name). Even tracking down the reporting channel (email, Jira, etc..) can take time and isn't automatable. Unfortunately, when facing problems of this scale, individual reporting doesn't work well either.

Additionally, if I just spam out emails or issues, I'll just overwhelm already over-taxed maintainers, I don't want to do this either.

By creating a pull request, I am aiming to provide maintainers something highly actionable to actually fix the identified vulnerability; a pull request.

There's a larger discussion on this topic that can be found here: [JLLeitschuh/security-research#12](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/discussions/12)

## Opting Out

If you'd like to opt out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called

`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:

```
User-agent: JLLeitschuh/security-research
Disallow: *

```

This bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.

Alternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.

## CLA Requirements

*This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions.*

It is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed off.

> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin
>
> (see <https://developercertificate.org/> for more information).
>
> - [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)

If signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.

## Sponsorship & Support

This contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate Dan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.

This PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST transformations to fix bugs, standardize code style, apply best practices, migrate library versions, and fix common security vulnerabilities at scale.

This fixes a Zip-Slip vulnerability.

This change does one of two things. This change either

1. Inserts a guard to protect against Zip Slip.
OR
2. Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath())`, which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks, with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.

For number 2, consider `\"/usr/outnot\".startsWith(\"/usr/out\")`.
The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.
It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.
For example, on Linux, `println(new File(\"/var\"))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\")` will print `/var/`;
however, `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.

Based on the conversation here, mainly that the file that would exploit this vulnerability comes from the user, I do not agree that this is a 'critical' vulnerability which can be executed remotely, at least not without caveats. Though, correct me if I'm wrong. |

| If it can be exploited remotely, Zip Slip is considered critical in most scenarios because it can be used to achieve remote code execution. Remote code execution is possible because zip slip allows an attacker to write the contents of executable files into executed files/directories. For example, on windows there are files that, if placed in the correct directory, will automatically execute on login. |

| They very certainly did, and they are indeed a CNA.  I stand corrected, and I learned something new this evening.  Just a FYI, this is going to trigger a massive number of PRs from Dependabot, probably tomorrow.  This is why I asked the TestNG maintainers to be involved in the disclosure process multiple times. Because now someone else (Vuln DB) has come along and now controls the messaging going out about this vulnerability. Ideally this information should be coming from the maintainers directly to help provide the most clear information. |

| In any case, if anyone thinks the CVE is inaccurate, they can ask VulDB to correct it. They are receptive to feedback in my experience. In the worst case, the CVE still informs the public about the vulnerability and the patch for it even if the CVE description is less than accurate, so I'm not that concerned about it. |

Vaild response. Touché. Given the number of cases of this vulnerability across open source (GitHub's CodeQL flags 900+ cases), and I'm attempting to actually fix these vulnerabilities at scale, (I've automatically generated 165 PRs for Zip Slip alone so far) it's unfortunately impractical to attempt to coordinate disclosure at that kind of scale.  I've often thought about attempting to automate the CVE issuance process, but I haven't yet, and I'm beginning to think that having a human in the loop in the general case for CVE issuance is better than attempting full automation.  I see what you're saying, and I welcome suggestions. |

| It would be useful if a release incorporating this change could be made. I am not sure I see this security fix as a critical issue, but Github has started spamming maintainers of packages that use testng whenever they push. Realise that its a pain to do so, but 7.6.2 would be appreciated.  Thanks for the work on testng, whatever you decide to do. |

| Is this really a security issue? It appears that this method is only used for handling the `-testjar` flag. I haven't used `-testjar` personally, but the docs (<https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#running-testng>) indicate that "[...] all the test classes found in this jar file will be considered test classes."  If an attacker can feed a malicious jar into `-testjar`, they've already won. They don't need to craft a special zip file with a bad file header that causes a write to a file on disk that will executed at some random time in the future; they can just include a malicious test in said jar (which testng will happily run immediately).  (There's some discussion above, but not really a definite "this isn't a real issue")  Ref: <https://github.com/cbeust/testng/blob/c0e1e772f1fc0ab2142f3a4114a2b8cfe60fa7e1/testng-core/src/main/java/org/testng/TestNG.java#L414-L420>; `m_jarPath` in that context is fed from <https://github.com/cbeust/testng/blob/c0e1e772f1fc0ab2142f3a4114a2b8cfe60fa7e1/testng-core/src/main/java/org/testng/TestNG.java#L1641>   ---   Did some testing with `-testjar` (using Java 8, since that's what I happen to have installed right now):  ``` <!-- pom.xml --> <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"   xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">   <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>    <groupId>test</groupId>   <artifactId>test</artifactId>   <version>1.0</version>    <properties>     <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>     <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>   </properties>    <dependencies> 	  <dependency> 		  <groupId>org.testng</groupId> 		  <artifactId>testng</artifactId> 		  <version>7.5</version> 	  </dependency>   </dependencies> </project> ```  ``` // src/main/java/EvilTest.java import org.testng.annotations.Test;  public class EvilTest { 	@Test public void doEvil() { 		System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 	} } ```  ``` $ mvn package exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.testng.TestNG -Dexec.arguments="-testjar,target/test-1.0.jar" <snip> [INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:3.1.0:java (default-cli) @ test --- SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".

| Hmm, currently one of our projects is built by maven and compiled with the java version 8. Fortunately, a project that uses the testng is a separate module that contains only tests and has a dependency on the main code. So I guess I could use a [toolchain](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html) and change the compilation version to 11. Although I guess my case might not be the only one that uses java 8 in the project and in some cases it might be harder to update the java version. |

We took the time to analyze it and you can read [our findings](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/24062#issuecomment-1525631857).  tl;dr:   * Only applicable to TestNG [6.13, 7.6.1] * Severity feels really inflated, planning to follow up on this. Conclusion in agreement with the [comment](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/pull/2806#issuecomment-1341767146) from [@jeffreytolar](https://github.com/jeffreytolar) |

| Hi [@ljacomet](https://github.com/ljacomet) Thanks for the analyze. You confirm what we supposed.  The good part is it forced some users to upgrade 😅 I'm glad to see you plan to upgrade too 👍 [gradle/gradle#24930](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/24930)  Could you explain why testng is embedded and not used from the classpath? I remember an issue where it was a problem ([@krmahadevan](https://github.com/krmahadevan) do you have the issue number in mind?) |

| [@ljacomet](https://github.com/ljacomet) - Here's the issue that [@juherr](https://github.com/juherr) is referring to [gradle/gradle#10507](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10507)  This got closed automatically because it turned stale :(  And here's another one that I have created in TestNG, which is also due to Gradle bringing in an old version of TestNG as an embedded dependency  [#2766](https://github.com/testng-team/testng/issues/2766) |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Cherrypick Zip Slip Vulnerability to 7.5 release

Security Vulnerability Fix

This pull request fixes a Zip Slip vulnerability either due to an insufficient, or missing guard when unzipping zip files.

Even if you deem, as the maintainer of this project, this is not necessarily fixing a security vulnerability, it is still, most likely, a valid security hardening.

Preamble

Impact

This issue allows a malicious zip file to potentially break out of the expected destination directory, writing contents into arbitrary locations on the file system.

Overwriting certain files/directories could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution on a target system by exploiting this vulnerability.

Why?

The best description of Zip-Slip can be found in the white paper published by Snyk: [Zip Slip Vulnerability](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability)

But I had a guard in place, why wasn't it sufficient?

If the changes you see are a change to the guard, not the addition of a new guard, this is probably because this code contains a Zip-Slip vulnerability due to a partial path traversal vulnerability.

To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider "/usr/outnot".startsWith("/usr/out").

The check is bypassed although /outnot is not under the /out directory.

It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various String representations of the File object.

For example, on Linux, println(new File("/var")) will print /var, but println(new File("/var", "/") will print /var/;

however, println(new File("/var", "/").getCanonicalPath()) will print /var.

The Fix

Implementing a guard comparing paths with the method java.nio.files.Path#startsWith will adequately protect against this vulnerability.

For example: file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE\_DIRECTORY) or file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE\_DIRECTORY\_FILE.getCanonicalFile().toPath())

➡️ Vulnerability Disclosure ⬅️

👋 Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!

First question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!

Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!

Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!

For partial path traversal, consider if user-supplied input could ever flow to this logic. If user-supplied input could reach this conditional, it's insufficient and, as such, most likely a vulnerability.

Vulnerability Disclosure How-To

You have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:

Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.

Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the Snyk's Disclosure Email. Note: Please include JLLeitschuh Disclosure in the subject of your email so it is not missed.

Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities

You can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).

I'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.

Source

This contribution was automatically generated with an [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) [refactoring recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/), which was lovingly handcrafted to bring this security fix to your repository.

The source code that generated this PR can be found here:

[Zip Slip](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/ZipSlip.java)

Why didn't you disclose privately (ie. coordinated disclosure)?

This PR was automatically generated, in-bulk, and sent to this project as well as many others, all at the same time.

This is technically what is called a "Full Disclosure" in vulnerability disclosure, and I agree it's less than ideal. If GitHub offered a way to create private pull requests to submit pull requests, I'd leverage it, but that infrastructure, sadly, doesn't exist yet.

The problem is that, as an open source software security researcher, I (exactly like open source maintainers), I only have so much time in a day. I'm able to find vulnerabilities impacting hundreds, or sometimes thousands of open source projects with tools like GitHub Code Search and CodeQL. The problem is that my knowledge of vulnerabilities doesn't scale very well.

Individualized vulnerability disclosure takes time and care. It's a long and tedious process, and I have a significant amount of experience with it (I have over 50 CVEs to my name). Even tracking down the reporting channel (email, Jira, etc..) can take time and isn't automatable. Unfortunately, when facing problems of this scale, individual reporting doesn't work well either.

Additionally, if I just spam out emails or issues, I'll just overwhelm already over-taxed maintainers, I don't want to do this either.

By creating a pull request, I am aiming to provide maintainers something highly actionable to actually fix the identified vulnerability; a pull request.

There's a larger discussion on this topic that can be found here: [JLLeitschuh/security-research#12](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/discussions/12)

Opting Out

If you'd like to opt out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called

.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt to your repository with the line:

User-agent: JLLeitschuh/security-research

Disallow: \*

This bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.

Alternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.

CLA Requirements

This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions.

It is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed off.

The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin

(see <https://developercertificate.org/> for more information).

* [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)

If signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.

Sponsorship & Support

This contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate Dan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.

This PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST transformations to fix bugs, standardize code style, apply best practices, migrate library versions, and fix common security vulnerabilities at scale.

vuln-fix: Zip Slip Vulnerability

This fixes a Zip-Slip vulnerability.

This change does one of two things. This change either

1. Inserts a guard to protect against Zip Slip.
OR
2. Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath())`, which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks, with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.

For number 2, consider `\"/usr/outnot\".startsWith(\"/usr/out\")`.
The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.
It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.
For example, on Linux, `println(new File(\"/var\"))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\")` will print `/var/`;
however, `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.

| [@prashil-g](https://github.com/prashil-g)  I have published a release candidate for `7.5.1` and would like to get your help in vetting it out quickly before we make it the final bugfix release which contains the vulnerability fix as well.  If you are using Maven, then please add the following to your pom file and bump up to `7.5.1`  ``` <repository>     <id>maven-central-staging</id>     <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/orgtestng-1081</url> </repository> ```  If you are on Gradle, use the below  ``` repositories {     mavenCentral()      maven {         url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/orgtestng-1081' } }  ```  Now, quickly check the `JarFileUtils` java class and see if your changes are present in it. That would confirm that the fix is available.  Once I hear back from you, I will wrap up this release and have this bugfix version published so that it lands in Maven Central and that should be the end of it.  Please let me know. |

## CWE-22 - Path Traversal

Path traversal (or directory traversal), is a vulnerability that allows malicious users to traverse the server's root directory, gaining access to arbitrary files and folders such as application code & data, back-end credentials, and sensitive operating system files. In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary files on the server, resulting in a denial of service attack. Such an exploit may severely impact the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of an application.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

## TestNG is vulnerable to Path Traversal

High severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-rc2q-x9mf-w3vf)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-rc2q-x9mf-w3vf/dependabot)

## Package

maven

org.testng:testng
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 6.13, < 7.5.1
>= 7.6.0, < 7.7.0

## Patched versions

7.5.1
7.7.0

## Description

### Impact

Affected by this vulnerability is the function `testngXmlExistsInJar` of the file `testng-core/src/main/java/org/testng/JarFileUtils.java` of the component `XML File Parser`.

The manipulation leads to path traversal only for `.xml`, `.yaml` and `.yml` files by default. The attack implies running an unsafe test JAR. However since that JAR can also contain executable code itself, the path traversal is unlikely to be the main attack.

### Patches

A patch is available in [version 7.7.0](https://github.com/cbeust/testng/releases/tag/7.7.0) at commit 9150736cd2c123a6a3b60e6193630859f9f0422b. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The patch was pushed into the master branch but no releases have yet been made with the patch included.

A backport of the fix is available in [version 7.5.1]((<https://github.com/cbeust/testng/releases/tag/7.5.1>) for Java 8 projects.

### Workaround

* Specify which tests to run when invoking TestNG by configuring them on the CLI or in the build tool controlling the run.
* Do not run tests with untrusted JARs on the classpath, this includes pull requests on open source projects.

# Security Vulnerability Fix

This pull request fixes a Zip Slip vulnerability either due to an insufficient, or missing guard when unzipping zip files.

Even if you deem, as the maintainer of this project, this is not necessarily fixing a security vulnerability, it is still, most likely, a valid security hardening.

## Preamble

### Impact

This issue allows a malicious zip file to potentially break out of the expected destination directory, writing contents into arbitrary locations on the file system.

Overwriting certain files/directories could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution on a target system by exploiting this vulnerability.

### Why?

The best description of Zip-Slip can be found in the white paper published by Snyk: [Zip Slip Vulnerability](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability)

#### But I had a guard in place, why wasn't it sufficient?

If the changes you see are a change to the guard, not the addition of a new guard, this is probably because this code contains a Zip-Slip vulnerability due to a partial path traversal vulnerability.

To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `"/usr/outnot".startsWith("/usr/out")`.

The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.

It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.

For example, on Linux, `println(new File("/var"))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File("/var", "/")` will print `/var/`;

however, `println(new File("/var", "/").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.

### The Fix

Implementing a guard comparing paths with the method `java.nio.files.Path#startsWith` will adequately protect against this vulnerability.

For example: `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)` or `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY_FILE.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`

### Other Examples

# ➡️ Vulnerability Disclosure ⬅️

👋 Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!

First question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!

1. Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!
2. Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!

For partial path traversal, consider if user-supplied input could ever flow to this logic. If user-supplied input could reach this conditional, it's insufficient and, as such, most likely a vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Disclosure How-To

You have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:

1. Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.
2. Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the Snyk's Disclosure Email. Note: Please include `JLLeitschuh Disclosure` in the subject of your email so it is not missed.

## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities

You can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).

I'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.

## Source

This contribution was automatically generated with an [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) [refactoring recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/), which was lovingly handcrafted to bring this security fix to your repository.

The source code that generated this PR can be found here:

[Zip Slip](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/ZipSlip.java)

## Why didn't you disclose privately (ie. coordinated disclosure)?

This PR was automatically generated, in-bulk, and sent to this project as well as many others, all at the same time.

This is technically what is called a "Full Disclosure" in vulnerability disclosure, and I agree it's less than ideal. If GitHub offered a way to create private pull requests to submit pull requests, I'd leverage it, but that infrastructure, sadly, doesn't exist yet.

The problem is that, as an open source software security researcher, I (exactly like open source maintainers), I only have so much time in a day. I'm able to find vulnerabilities impacting hundreds, or sometimes thousands of open source projects with tools like GitHub Code Search and CodeQL. The problem is that my knowledge of vulnerabilities doesn't scale very well.

Individualized vulnerability disclosure takes time and care. It's a long and tedious process, and I have a significant amount of experience with it (I have over 50 CVEs to my name). Even tracking down the reporting channel (email, Jira, etc..) can take time and isn't automatable. Unfortunately, when facing problems of this scale, individual reporting doesn't work well either.

Additionally, if I just spam out emails or issues, I'll just overwhelm already over-taxed maintainers, I don't want to do this either.

By creating a pull request, I am aiming to provide maintainers something highly actionable to actually fix the identified vulnerability; a pull request.

There's a larger discussion on this topic that can be found here: [JLLeitschuh/security-research#12](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/discussions/12)

## Opting Out

If you'd like to opt out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called

`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:

```
User-agent: JLLeitschuh/security-research
Disallow: *

```

This bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.

Alternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.

## CLA Requirements

*This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions.*

It is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed off.

> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin
>
> (see <https://developercertificate.org/> for more information).
>
> - [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)

If signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.

## Sponsorship & Support

This contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate Dan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.

This PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST transformations to fix bugs, standardize code style, apply best practices, migrate library versions, and fix common security vulnerabilities at scale.

## Tracking

This change does one of two things. This change either

| [They very certainly did](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/blob/master/2022/4xxx/CVE-2022-4065.json#L9), [and they are indeed a CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/VulDB).  Based on the conversation here, mainly that the file that would exploit this vulnerability comes from the user, I do not agree that this is a 'critical' vulnerability which can be executed remotely, at least not without caveats. Though, correct me if I'm wrong. |

| If it can be exploited remotely, Zip Slip is considered critical in most scenarios because it can be used to achieve remote code execution. Remote code execution is possible because zip slip allows an attacker to write the contents of executable files into executed files/directories. For example, on windows there are files that, if placed in the correct directory, will automatically execute on login. |

| They very certainly did, and they are indeed a CNA.  I stand corrected, and I learned something new this evening.  Just a FYI, this is going to trigger a massive number of PRs from Dependabot, probably tomorrow.  This is why I asked the TestNG maintainers to be involved in the disclosure process multiple times. Because now someone else (Vuln DB) has come along and now controls the messaging going out about this vulnerability. Ideally this information should be coming from the maintainers directly to help provide the most clear information. |

| In any case, if anyone thinks the CVE is inaccurate, they can ask VulDB to correct it. They are receptive to feedback in my experience. In the worst case, the CVE still informs the public about the vulnerability and the patch for it even if the CVE description is less than accurate, so I'm not that concerned about it. |

| If you're worried about coordinated disclosure, why don't you begin by coordinating disclosure yourself rather than apparently automatedly filing PRs to fix vulnerabilities that you can't be sure are actually exploitable?  Vaild response. Touché. Given the number of cases of this vulnerability across open source (GitHub's CodeQL flags 900+ cases), and I'm attempting to actually fix these vulnerabilities at scale, (I've automatically generated 165 PRs for Zip Slip alone so far) it's unfortunately impractical to attempt to coordinate disclosure at that kind of scale.  I've often thought about attempting to automate the CVE issuance process, but I haven't yet, and I'm beginning to think that having a human in the loop in the general case for CVE issuance is better than attempting full automation.  I see what you're saying, and I welcome suggestions. |

| It would be useful if a release incorporating this change could be made. I am not sure I see this security fix as a critical issue, but Github has started spamming maintainers of packages that use testng whenever they push. Realise that its a pain to do so, but 7.6.2 would be appreciated.  Thanks for the work on testng, whatever you decide to do. |

| Is this really a security issue? It appears that this method is only used for handling the `-testjar` flag. I haven't used `-testjar` personally, but the docs (<https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#running-testng>) indicate that "[...] all the test classes found in this jar file will be considered test classes."  If an attacker can feed a malicious jar into `-testjar`, they've already won. They don't need to craft a special zip file with a bad file header that causes a write to a file on disk that will executed at some random time in the future; they can just include a malicious test in said jar (which testng will happily run immediately).  (There's some discussion above, but not really a definite "this isn't a real issue")  Ref: <https://github.com/cbeust/testng/blob/c0e1e772f1fc0ab2142f3a4114a2b8cfe60fa7e1/testng-core/src/main/java/org/testng/TestNG.java#L414-L420>; `m_jarPath` in that context is fed from <https://github.com/cbeust/testng/blob/c0e1e772f1fc0ab2142f3a4114a2b8cfe60fa7e1/testng-core/src/main/java/org/testng/TestNG.java#L1641>   ---   Did some testing with `-testjar` (using Java 8, since that's what I happen to have installed right now):  ``` <!-- pom.xml --> <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"   xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">   <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>    <groupId>test</groupId>   <artifactId>test</artifactId>   <version>1.0</version>    <properties>     <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>     <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>   </properties>    <dependencies> 	  <dependency> 		  <groupId>org.testng</groupId> 		  <artifactId>testng</artifactId> 		  <version>7.5</version> 	  </dependency>   </dependencies> </project> ```  ``` // src/main/java/EvilTest.java import org.testng.annotations.Test;  public class EvilTest { 	@Test public void doEvil() { 		System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 	} } ```  ``` $ mvn package exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.testng.TestNG -Dexec.arguments="-testjar,target/test-1.0.jar" <snip> [INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:3.1.0:java (default-cli) @ test --- SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".

| Hmm, currently one of our projects is built by maven and compiled with the java version 8. Fortunately, a project that uses the testng is a separate module that contains only tests and has a dependency on the main code. So I guess I could use a [toolchain](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html) and change the compilation version to 11. Although I guess my case might not be the only one that uses java 8 in the project and in some cases it might be harder to update the java version. |
