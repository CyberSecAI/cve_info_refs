  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The commit `3556ae4e651d9443dc3bb8a170dd3cc726517a53` addresses an access control issue within the 'usememos/memos' repository. The changes primarily involve removing the `json:"-"` tags from struct fields that are not intended to be exposed in API requests or responses. This could potentially expose sensitive data. Additionally, there were corrections in the error messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect use of `json:"-"` tags leading to potential exposure of sensitive data.",
      "Inconsistent error messages."
    ],
    "impact": "The potential impact is exposure of sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially exploit the incorrect API response that exposes unintended fields via the API.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would require the ability to send crafted requests to the API"
