- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly check for CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) when creating and deleting custom user roles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into creating or deleting arbitrary custom user roles, potentially leading to privilege escalation or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious link or webpage that, when opened by a logged-in admin, submits a request to the vulnerable plugin. This can be done via GET (deletion) and POST (creation) requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into interacting with the malicious content.
