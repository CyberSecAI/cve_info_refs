- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Workreap theme does not verify if an addon service belongs to the user making the request when processing the `workreap_addons_service_remove` action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Any user, even those with subscriber-level privileges, can delete arbitrary posts by knowing or guessing their IDs.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user crafts a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=workreap_addons_service_remove` parameter, including the ID of the post they wish to delete.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least subscriber level access to the WordPress instance and the ability to send HTTP requests. They also need to know or guess the ID of the post to delete.
