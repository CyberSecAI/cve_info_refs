- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape a shortcode attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of the `location` shortcode attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected content. This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages the plugin's shortcode functionality, injecting malicious JavaScript into the `location` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role, which allows them to create and edit posts where they can insert the malicious shortcode.
