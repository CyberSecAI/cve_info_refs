Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `Bulk Delete Users by Email` WordPress plugin fails to sanitize and escape a user-supplied parameter (`de-text`) before outputting it back into the web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of input sanitization: The plugin does not properly clean the user-provided input.
*   Lack of output encoding: The plugin doesn't encode the output, which is essential when displaying user-provided data in HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can be used to:
    *   Steal cookies and session data, potentially hijacking the user's account.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious website.
    *   Modify the content of the web page.
    *   Perform actions on the website on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript in the `de-text` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site to visit the specially crafted URL. This could be done through social engineering or by injecting the link somewhere the admin is likely to click on it.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable URL is of the form: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bulk-delete-users-by-email%2Fplugin.php&de-text=[MALICIOUS_JAVASCRIPT_CODE]`.
*   The provided proof-of-concept URL is: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bulk-delete-users-by-email%2Fplugin.php&de-text=</textarea><svg%2Fonload%3Dalert(%2FXSS%2F)>`
*   The payload `</textarea><svg%2Fonload%3Dalert(%2FXSS%2F)>` will trigger an alert box with the text "XSS" when rendered in the browser within the context of the vulnerable page.

**Additional Information:**
* The affected plugin is `Bulk Delete Users by Email` version 1.2 or below
* There is no known fix for the vulnerability at the time the report was published (2022-12-02).
