{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate the file to be deleted via an AJAX action available to unauthenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated access to a file deletion function",
    "Lack of input validation allowing path traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file deletion on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication is required, and the attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.",
    "Additional Information": "The exploit requires an initial request to create an upload directory.  The proof of concept demonstrates how to use curl to create the directory and then exploit the vulnerability."
