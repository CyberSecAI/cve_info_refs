The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository. It indicates a fix for a vulnerability in the `lib/gener/view.php` file of the MyCMS project.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-provided data when displaying content in the details view of the visitors module. Specifically, HTML tags in the data were being rendered directly without any encoding or filtering, leading to potential security issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a potential XSS vulnerability. If a malicious user can inject HTML or JavaScript code into a field that is displayed in the details view (through the 'converted' or `db_name` fields), it would be executed by other users viewing that data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by injecting malicious scripts.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- **Defacement:** An attacker might be able to deface the page or redirect users to a malicious website.
- **Data theft:** An attacker could potentially access data through XHR requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to find an input field which ends up being displayed on the user side, and which is vulnerable to HTML injection.
- The specific vectors are likely to include:
    - Data displayed through the `converted` variable, after being converted from user input.
    - Data displayed from the `db_name` field.
- Injection of HTML and script tags via the vulnerable input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to add malicious data to the fields being displayed. This might require access to a form in the application that populates these fields.
- No special privileges are explicitly mentioned. An attacker would need some access to add data, but not necessarily administrative privileges.

**Fix:**
The commit introduces the `strip_tags()` function to sanitize the vulnerable data.
- `strip_tags($converted)` is applied to user provided converted text before it's displayed to the user.
- `strip_tags($original)` is applied to user provided original text before it's displayed to the user.
- `strip_tags($this->row[$db_name])` is applied to the database field before it is displayed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message explicitly mentions "Vulnerability fix".
- The diff shows that the `strip_tags()` function has been added in two locations in the `build_view` function to prevent HTML from rendering.
- The original code was vulnerable to XSS because it was outputting potentially user-provided text directly into the HTML, without sanitization.

This commit addresses the XSS vulnerability by removing HTML tags, preventing the execution of injected JavaScript.
