- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the page. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a 'contributor' role in WordPress.
