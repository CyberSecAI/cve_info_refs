- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with contributor-level privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code through a shortcode, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users, including those with higher privileges like administrators. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as taking over the site.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with JavaScript payloads and injecting it through content creation or editing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
