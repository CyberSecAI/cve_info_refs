- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the website, which are then executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to privilege escalation if an admin views a crafted post.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode and embedding it in a post, page, or other content that allows shortcodes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to create posts/pages containing the malicious shortcode.
