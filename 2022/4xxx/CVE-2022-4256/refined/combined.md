## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# All-in-One Addons for Elementor - WidgetKit < 2.4.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Go to WidgetKit -> API Keys, put the following payload in the fields and click Activate: "><script>alert(/xss/)</script><
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the page again

### Affects Plugins
