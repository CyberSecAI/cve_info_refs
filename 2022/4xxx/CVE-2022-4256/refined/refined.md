- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of other users when they access the affected pages. This can lead to various impacts, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to access the plugin's settings page (`WidgetKit -> API Keys`) and input the malicious payload into the vulnerable input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high privilege user access to the WordPress admin dashboard.
