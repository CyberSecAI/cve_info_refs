## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Sliderby10Web < 1.2.53 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Slider » Sliders" and edit one of the Sliders or add a new one.
2. Click the "Slide options" and enter: 1" onmouseenter="alert(/XSS/)" ", in the input box named "Link the slide to".
3. Click Save » refresh the page, and hover the mouse over the input box under 'Slide options' to check the XSS popup.
