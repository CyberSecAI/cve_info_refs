Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Popup Manager plugin lacks authorization checks when deleting popups.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin does not verify if the user attempting to delete a popup has the necessary permissions to do so.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The lack of CSRF protection makes it possible to trigger the delete action through a cross-site request forgery attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Popup Deletion:** Unauthenticated users can delete any popup from the website. This could lead to disruption of website functionality that depends on these popups, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not need to be logged in to the website to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can trick an authenticated user into sending a crafted request that deletes popups.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker can be an unauthenticated user browsing the site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=pm_delete_popup` and the `popup_id` parameters.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
*   The specific parameters needed are: `action=pm_delete_popup` and `popup_id=[ID of popup to delete]`.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates this by using javascript to trigger a fetch request with the required parameters.

*   The vulnerability is classified as a "NO AUTHORISATION" type.
*   It is related to OWASP Top 10 "A5: Broken Access Control".
*   The corresponding CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
*   The CVSS score is 5.3 (Medium).
