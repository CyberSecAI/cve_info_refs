Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the affected firmware drivers. These drivers check for the existence of certain NVRAM variables but not their actual values. By creating specific NVRAM variables, an attacker can manipulate the Secure Boot settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure NVRAM Variable Handling:** The firmware incorrectly relies on the mere presence of NVRAM variables instead of their content, making it vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Secure Boot Bypass:** By exploiting the NVRAM variable handling, the Secure Boot feature can be disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unsigned Bootloader Execution:** Disabling Secure Boot allows an attacker to load a custom, unsigned bootloader.
*   **OS Loading Control:** The attacker gains absolute control over the OS loading process.
*   **Malware Deployment:** Attackers can bypass or disable security protections and silently deploy malware payloads with system privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker effectively gains full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **NVRAM Manipulation:** The attacker creates specific NVRAM variables through an unspecified attack vector (possibly through the OS or some other interface).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to modify NVRAM variables. The specific mechanism to do this is not detailed in this document.
*   The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges or access to modify NVRAM.

**Affected Models:**

*   Acer Aspire A315-22
*   Acer Aspire A115-21
*   Acer Aspire A315-22G
*   Acer Extensa EX215-21
*   Acer Extensa EX215-21G

**Resolution:**

*   Update the BIOS to version 1.11 or newer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Martin Smolar from ESET.
*   The specific mechanism to create the NVRAM variables is not described in this document
*   The document mentions that "the actual value of the variable is not important, only the existence is checked".
