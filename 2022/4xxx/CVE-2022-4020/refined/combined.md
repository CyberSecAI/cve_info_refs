# Security Vulnerability That May Allow Changes to Secure Boot Settings

## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Researchers have identified a vulnerability that may allow changes to Secure Boot settings by creating NVRAM variables (actual value of the variable is not important, only the existence is checked by the affected firmware drivers).

**Reference number:** CVE-2022-4020

**Affected Models:** Acer Aspire A315-22, A115-21, A315-22G, Extensa EX215-21 and EX215-21G

## Impact

By disabling the Secure Boot feature, an attacker can load their own unsigned malicious bootloader to allow absolute control over the OS loading process. This can allow them to disable or bypass protections to silently deploy their own payloads with the system privileges.

## Resolution

Acer recommends updating your BIOS to version 1.11 or newer to resolve this issue. You can download the latest BIOS from the [Acer Support Site](https://www.acer.com/us-en/support?filter=global_download&search=A315-22).
