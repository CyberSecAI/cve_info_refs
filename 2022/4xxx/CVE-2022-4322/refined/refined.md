{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application allows users with \"schedule\" permissions to define scheduled tasks. It leverages the Spring Framework's bean container to execute methods. By crafting a specific payload, an attacker can call the `org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate#execute(java.lang.String)` method which can execute arbitrary SQL queries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted method execution through scheduled tasks",
      "Arbitrary SQL injection via method parameter"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary SQL query execution, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by using database specific commands (e.g. UDF functions for privilege escalation).  In the provided exploit, an attacker can create new administrator users.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user with \"schedule\" permissions can define and execute a malicious scheduled task via the application's web interface.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have valid credentials for a user account with 'schedule' permissions."
