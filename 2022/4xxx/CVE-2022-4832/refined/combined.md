## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Store Locator WordPress < 1.4.9 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[ASL\_STORELOCATOR full\_height='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']

### Affects Plugins
