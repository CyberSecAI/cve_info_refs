- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser. This can allow attackers to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by embedding a malicious shortcode with specific attributes into a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor role on the WordPress site to create/edit posts and embed shortcodes.
