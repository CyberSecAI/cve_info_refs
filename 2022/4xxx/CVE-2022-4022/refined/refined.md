  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The SVG Support plugin for WordPress defaults to insecure settings. SVG files containing malicious javascript are not sanitized. Although version 2.5 adds the ability to sanitize images as they are uploaded, the plugin defaults to disable sanitization and does not restrict SVG upload to only administrators.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default settings",
      "Lack of sanitization of SVG files",
      "Insufficient restrictions on SVG uploads"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers, with author-level privileges and higher, can upload malicious SVG files that can be embedded in posts and pages by higher privileged users. The embedded JavaScript is also triggered when visiting the image URL, allowing the attacker to execute malicious code in browsers visiting that URL.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Uploading malicious SVG files via WordPress media library",
      "Embedding SVG files in posts and pages",
