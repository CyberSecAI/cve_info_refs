## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Hueman Addons <= 2.3.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

[column size='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;"']
Required theme: https://wordpress.org/themes/hueman/ (the shortcode is added only if this theme is used, because according to the wp.org standard, add\_shortcode() is plugin territory)

### Affects Plugins
