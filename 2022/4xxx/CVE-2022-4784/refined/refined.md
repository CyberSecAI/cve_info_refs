- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page or post that, when viewed by other users, will execute within the context of their browser, allowing for actions such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript within the shortcode attribute, which is then stored in the database and executed when a user views a page or post containing that shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with a Contributor role or higher can exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to create posts and use shortcodes to inject the malicious content.
