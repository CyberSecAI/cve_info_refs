- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin unserializes user input provided via the settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with admin privileges can achieve arbitrary code execution by injecting a malicious PHP object during the settings import process if a suitable gadget is present.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the "Import Settings" feature in the plugin's settings page by uploading a specially crafted import file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative privileges within the WordPress installation to access the settings page and perform the import operation. They also need to have a suitable gadget class present in the WordPress installation to be able to achieve code execution.
