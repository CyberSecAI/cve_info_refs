- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back on a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the affected page/post, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the page. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in the WordPress instance, allowing them to create/modify posts that include shortcodes.
