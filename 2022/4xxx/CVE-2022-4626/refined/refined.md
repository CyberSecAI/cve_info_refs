- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page through the vulnerable shortcode. This injected code could then be executed in the browsers of other users, including high-privilege users like administrators, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript embedded in one of its attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least the "Contributor" role to create or modify content containing the malicious shortcode.
