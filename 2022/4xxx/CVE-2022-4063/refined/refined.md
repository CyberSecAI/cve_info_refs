  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin insecurely uses PHP's `extract()` function when rendering HTML views.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability which can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The vulnerable code allows attackers to include arbitrary files and URLs.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, which can expose sensitive information. The LFI vulnerability can be escalated to RCE, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance."
