Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit message states "added SVG to forbidden file types in order to prevent possible XSS." This indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability was the lack of proper sanitization or filtering of uploaded files, allowing the upload of SVG files that could potentially contain malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By uploading a malicious SVG file, an attacker could potentially inject client-side scripts that would be executed when a user views the uploaded file or interacts with it on the website.
- **Lack of file type validation/sanitization:** The software did not have sufficient checks to prevent the uploading of potentially harmful file types like SVG.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page through a crafted SVG file. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session information, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Data exfiltration/modification:** An attacker could modify content on the site or exfiltrate sensitive user data.
- **Website defacement:** The attacker can modify the appearance or function of the website.
- **Phishing:** By injecting JavaScript, an attacker could redirect users to malicious websites and steal their credentials.

**Attack vectors:**

- **File upload:** The attacker would need to upload a specially crafted SVG file using the upload functionality of the affected application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to upload files:** The attacker needs to be able to access the upload function on the website. They do not necessarily need to be an administrator, as the vulnerability could be present in a publicly accessible upload feature.
- **Technical knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SVG file containing XSS payloads.

**Additional notes:**

- The commit diff shows the addition of 'svg' to the list of forbidden file extensions in the `admin.uploader.php` file. This is a remediation of the vulnerability.
- The provided commit information references CVE-2022-24588, however, this CVE is different. The associated PDF is not present to confirm any relation. This indicates that the provided commit might be for a fix for a similar vulnerability.
