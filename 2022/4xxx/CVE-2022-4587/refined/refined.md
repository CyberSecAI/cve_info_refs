The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4587.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the login page of the oc-server3 application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application was not properly sanitizing user input on the login page, specifically the username field.
- The username value was directly inserted into the HTML without proper escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the username field.
- When a user logs in with the malicious payload as username, the injected JavaScript code will execute in their browser.
- This could allow an attacker to perform actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the username field on the login page.
- An attacker can inject the malicious code by providing it as the username during login.
- The specific payload used was `<svG onLoad=prompt(9)>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the login page of the application.
- The attacker would need to have the ability to input the malicious code into the username field.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported on Open Bug Bounty with report ID 1146814.
- The fix involved escaping the username field before outputting it into the HTML, specifically using `{$username|escape}` in the template file `htdocs/templates2/ocstyle/login.tpl`.
