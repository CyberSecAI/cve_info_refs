**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `extra_actions` function of the Permalink Manager Lite plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into clicking a malicious link, which executes the forged request.
