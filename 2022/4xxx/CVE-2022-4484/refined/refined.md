- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page, which will be executed when a user views that page. This can lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.  The stored XSS can be used against high-privilege users like admins.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code within a shortcode attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to a WordPress site to insert the malicious shortcode.
