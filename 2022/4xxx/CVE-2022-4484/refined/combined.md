## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Super Socializer < 7.13.44 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[TheChamp-Sharing style='display:block!important;background:red;width:100px;height:100px;" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
