## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Table Reloaded <= 1.9.4 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escapes some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks, which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[table id='1' border='1" onmouseover="alert(1)']

### Affects Plugins
