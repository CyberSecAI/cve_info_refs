Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The WP Table Reloaded plugin fails to properly validate and sanitize shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
*   **Weakness:**  The plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input validation and output encoding/escaping of shortcode attributes.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page. This code can be executed in the browsers of other users, including administrators, when they view the affected page.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker exploits the vulnerability by inserting a specially crafted shortcode containing malicious JavaScript into a post or page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have at least the "contributor" role to be able to create or modify posts and pages and insert the malicious shortcode.
    *   No special network access or conditions are mentioned.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is triggered through the `table` shortcode. Specifically, attributes like `border` are not sanitized, allowing the injection of JavaScript code via HTML event attributes, such as `onmouseover`. The provided proof of concept demonstrates this: `[table id='1' border='1" onmouseover="alert(1)']`

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Plugin:** WP Table Reloaded, versions 1.9.4 and earlier.
*   **No Known Fix:** The content explicitly states there is "No known fix" for this vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:**  6.8 (Medium)

This analysis aligns with the general description of CVE-2022-4491 as being related to stored XSS vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins.
