The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Lead Management System's `login.php` file, specifically within the `username` parameter. This vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `username` parameter in `login.php`. The application does not filter or escape special characters, leading to direct inclusion of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication, potentially read sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. The provided examples demonstrate:
    *   Time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP(5)` to confirm the vulnerability.
    *   Bypassing authentication using `username=1'or 1=1 #&password=123456&login=` to login as any user.
    *    Confirmation of blind SQL time injection with a penetration tool.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `login.php` with malicious SQL code in the `username` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required to exploit this. The provided example uses a POST request to the login form.

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by including:
