The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4351.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection (SQLi). The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization and escaping of a parameter before it's used in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the database. This could lead to data breaches, site defacement, or complete compromise of the affected WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is located in the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. The vulnerable parameter is part of the `action=save_all_page_meta` request, specifically the `post_id` parameter. The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint containing the malicious SQL payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges, such as an administrator.
