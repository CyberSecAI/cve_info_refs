The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4641.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `File.createTempFile()` which creates temporary files with insecure default permissions, allowing other local users to read their contents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File
- Information Disclosure due to overly permissive file permissions on temporary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious local user could read sensitive information stored in the temporary files, potentially leading to further compromise of the application or the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required, as the vulnerability arises from how temporary files are created within the same system and are accessible by other local users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the same machine where the vulnerable application is running.
- The attacker needs to be a separate user account than the user running the vulnerable application.
