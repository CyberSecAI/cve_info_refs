Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4028:

**Vulnerability:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Plugin:** Simple:Press

**Affected Versions:** <= 6.8

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when modifying a profile signature. Specifically, the `postitem` parameter is not properly sanitized during the profile-save action, allowing for injection of object and embed tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `postitem` parameter.
- Lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping for user-controlled data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected content (profile signature).
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Execution of arbitrary code within the victim's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated attacker with minimal permissions (e.g., subscriber) can modify their profile signature to inject malicious code.
- The injected code is stored in the database and executed when other users view the modified profile signature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site with minimal permissions (e.g., subscriber role).
- The attacker needs to be able to access and modify their profile settings, specifically the profile signature section, to inject the malicious script.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided content from `www.wordfence.com` explicitly mentions the vulnerability and its root cause.
- The content from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` shows code changes made in version 6.8.1 of Simple:Press to address multiple vulnerabilities, including the sanitization of the cookie value which is related to another vulnerability (CVE-2022-4029), and the addition of a check for object and embed tags which are related to this CVE.
- The fix includes sanitizing user input using `sanitize_file_name()` in several locations of the code, particularly when file names are extracted from the GET or POST parameters. It is used in the context of file deletion, theme editing, and file path manipulation. The code also implements a new check to deny the use of the OBJECT and EMBED tags unless explicitly allowed. Additionally, it implements `wp_kses_post()` in the display filter to sanitize content and prevents the use of unescaped data.
- The `sp-api-class-spcsavefilters.php` changes shows that there has been improvements to HTML sanitization to filter object and embed tags.
- The changelog in the `readme.txt` file mentions "Various security related fixes" in version 6.8.1, which would include this vulnerability.
