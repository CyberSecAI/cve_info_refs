- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ibtana WordPress plugin fails to validate and escape a shortcode attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the page containing the crafted shortcode. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with the `onmouseover` event containing JavaScript and inserting it into a post or page, an attacker can trigger the XSS when a user hovers over the shortcode's output.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a 'contributor' role on the WordPress site, allowing them to create or modify content containing the vulnerable shortcode.
