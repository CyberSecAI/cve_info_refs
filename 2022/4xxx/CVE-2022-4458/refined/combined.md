## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Amr Shortcode Any Widget <= 4.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. Insert a widget on the sidebar using the Text Block.
2. Get the widget ID by inspecting it using the browser developer tool.
3. Insert the following shortcode (change the ID accordingly):
[do\_widget id="block-9" class='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
4. Go to the page where the widget is inserted and hover it, the alert triggers.
