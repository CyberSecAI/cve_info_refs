- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Welcart e-Commerce plugin does not properly validate user input before using it in `file_exists()` function calls. This occurs via AJAX actions that are accessible to authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure deserialization (PHP Object Injection) due to the lack of sanitization of the `progressfile` parameter. The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted PHAR archive path is passed to the `file_exists` function, allowing PHAR deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by leveraging a gadget chain in the application code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through an AJAX request, specifically `admin-ajax.php`, using the `wel_check_progress_ajax` action. An attacker can craft a malicious PHAR file and provide its path via the `progressfile` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with the 'subscriber' role or higher. They also need to have the ability to upload a file, and they must identify a suitable gadget chain that can be triggered during PHAR deserialization.
