The provided content describes a vulnerability in the DocSys project, specifically related to arbitrary file download, and provides detailed steps for its exploitation.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `getUserImg` method in `com.DocSystem.controller.UserController`, where the `fileName` parameter is controllable and allows path traversal using `../`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize the `fileName` parameter in the `getUserImg` method, allowing attackers to use `../` to traverse the file system and access arbitrary files outside of the intended directory.
2. **Insufficient Access Control:** While the system has an interceptor (`com.DocSystem.controller.MyInterceptor`) intended to control access, it uses a flawed `contains` method to check against allowed URLs. This allows attackers to easily bypass the check by including the allowed path in the URL while still using path traversal techniques.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from the server's file system. This could lead to:
   - Disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, and credentials
   - Potential for further attacks by using the disclosed information

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `getUserImg` endpoint. The vulnerable URL is:
`http://localhost:8081/DocSystem/User/getUserImg?fileName=../../windows/win.ini&s=pay/refund`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability due to the bypass in the interceptor.
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application with a specially crafted `fileName` parameter containing path traversal sequences.
