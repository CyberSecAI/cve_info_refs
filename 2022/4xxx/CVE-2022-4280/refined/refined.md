Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an information leakage issue present in the `findUser` function of a smart campus system developed by Dot Tech. The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper access control or sanitization, leading to sensitive information being exposed through the `findUser` API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive user data.
*   **Lack of Authorization/Access Control:** The `findUser` endpoint does not appear to have adequate checks to verify the requester's authorization to access user data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive user data, potentially including personally identifiable information (PII), as demonstrated in the included screenshots. This can have various ramifications including identity theft, privacy violation, and potential for social engineering attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/services/Card/findUser` endpoint.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of sending HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Required** Based on the request, it does not appear as if authentication is required to make the request. This needs further verification to be completely accurate.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided payload shows a simple GET request to the `/services/Card/findUser` endpoint.
*   The response includes parts of the package containing what appears to be sensitive user information.
*   The system is identified as a smart campus system developed by Dot Tech (dianvo.com).
*   The system version is V1.0, and was tested on Windows 10 with phpstudy.
