## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Post Views Count <= 3.0.2 - Contributor+ Stored XSS in Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a Contributor+ create a new post and add the following shortcode.
[post\_view id='1" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;"']
Save it to be reviewed.
When an admin reviews the post and moves the mouse over the added code, the payload will be delivered.
