Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-4761

**Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Post Views Count" fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of input sanitization when handling shortcode attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a post or page. When a user (e.g., an administrator) views the page, the malicious script executes in their browser.
*   This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode injection:** An attacker crafts a malicious shortcode with JavaScript code in the attributes.
*   **User Role:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users with the contributor role and above.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have at least a "Contributor" role within the WordPress site to create or edit posts and insert the malicious shortcode.
*   The attacker requires the ability to create and save a new post (or edit an existing post) where the shortcode will be embedded.
*   The attack is triggered when another user, such as an admin, views or interacts with the post containing the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
*   The proof-of-concept shows how to inject JavaScript into the `id` and `style` attributes of the `post_view` shortcode.
*   The vulnerable plugin version is  `<= 3.0.2` .
*   There is "no known fix" mentioned in the content.
