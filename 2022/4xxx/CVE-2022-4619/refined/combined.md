CodeLights widgets work with Page Builder by SiteOrigin v2.10.11 onward.
CodeLights widgets are not working with SiteOrigin Page Builder version 2.10.0 – 2.10.10

For those who face difficulties after updating SO-Page-Builder: Make use of the Plugin “WP Rollback”. After rolling back Page Builder (for example to version 2.9.5) …everything works fine again!
Cheers & Thank you for your excellent work!

### Description

The Sidebar Widgets by CodeLights plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘Extra CSS class’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.
