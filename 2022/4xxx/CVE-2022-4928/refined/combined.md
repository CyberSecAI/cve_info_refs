[Ticket](https://app.assembla.com/spaces/lorepo/tickets/8593-zabezpieczenie-addonu-text_selection-przed-xss/details)

[Wersja testowa](https://test-8593-dot-mauthor-dev.ew.r.appspot.com)

[lekcja testowa](https://test-8593-dot-mauthor-dev.ew.r.appspot.com/embed/6501250919038976)

Na wersji testowej należy się upewnić czy addon tak samo się zachowuje podczas czytania TTS

**!!! Uwaga !!! To zadanie jest stworzone na podstawie [LC-8498](https://app.assembla.com/spaces/lorepo/tickets/8498), które ma zostać zmergowane do mastera**

Sorry, something went wrong.
