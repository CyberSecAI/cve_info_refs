The provided content is related to a commit that includes changes to access control in the `usememos/memos` repository. This commit addresses a vulnerability related to how creator IDs were handled, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modification of data.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause seems to be that creator IDs were not correctly being passed or used in the API layer of the application.  Specifically, the code was missing `json:"-"` tags on `CreatorID` fields in struct definitions. This meant that these fields could be populated by users when submitting requests, leading to potential access control issues. The code changes hide these fields from being included in the json data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  By manipulating the `CreatorID` field in a request, a malicious user could attempt to create, modify, or delete resources belonging to other users if the server did not properly ignore the field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data they do not own by changing the CreatorID in API requests.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker could potentially access or manipulate data associated with different users by manipulating creator IDs.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **API Manipulation:** An attacker could craft malicious API requests, including a manipulated `CreatorID`  in the JSON body to target other user's resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid account to be able to make authenticated API calls to the server.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge about the API and its structure to craft the malicious requests.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary JSON data to the server via API calls.

**Additional Details from Commit:**

*   The fix involves adding `json:"-"` to the `CreatorID` field in several API structs (`MemoCreate`, `MemoFind`, `ResourceCreate`, `ShortcutCreate`, `TagUpsert`, `UserSettingUpsert`), which will exclude these fields from the JSON data during serialization/deserialization processes.
*   This change means that these fields will be ignored when submitted by users. The server will properly set the creator IDs internally based on the user making the request, which will prevent the IDOR issue.
* The commit also includes other minor fixes/changes such as:
    *  Removal of `json:"-"` tag on fields that are supposed to be in JSON data.
    *   Fixes to error messages that remove the .SetInternal(err) for a cleaner error message

The commit message `fix: access control (#870)` directly indicates that this commit is intended to address a security issue related to access control and the changes made in the code confirm this.
