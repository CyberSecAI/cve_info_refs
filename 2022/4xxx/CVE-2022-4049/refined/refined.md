The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4049.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "WP User" does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in an SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in the handling of the 'id' parameter within the 'wpuser_group_action' action.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the database)
  - Data modification (modifying or deleting data)
  - Privilege escalation (depending on the database setup and permissions)

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access via HTTP requests.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the 'wpuser_group_action' AJAX action.
- Specifically, the 'id' parameter within the AJAX request is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress instance.
- Knowledge of the plugin's vulnerable endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`) and its parameters.
- Ability to obtain a valid nonce (`wpuser_update_setting`).

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a `SLEEP(5)` SQL command.
- The vulnerability exists in versions of the "WP User" plugin up to and including version 7.0.
- There is no known fix for this vulnerability at the time of the content's writing.
- The CVSS score for the vulnerability is 8.6 (High).
