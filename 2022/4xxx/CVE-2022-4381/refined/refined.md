- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate and escape one of its shortcode attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view a page/post containing the malicious shortcode, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting a malicious shortcode into a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor access to the WordPress site to create posts or pages and insert shortcodes. The XSS is triggered when the post/page is previewed or viewed and the form is submitted.
