**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a page viewed by other users. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `title` parameter, which is then reflected in the response.
Specifically the `bg_bibrefs` action of `admin-ajax.php` is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They only need to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to click it.
