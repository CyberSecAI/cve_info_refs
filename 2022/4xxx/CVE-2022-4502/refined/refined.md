Based on the provided content, this commit introduces changes to sanitize output by using the `text()` function in several PHP files and the `jsAttr()` function in `TreeMenu.php`. These changes are aimed to prevent potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The original code lacked proper sanitization of user-controlled data in various parts of the application. This could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code was vulnerable to XSS due to the lack of sanitization of output in the `messages.php`, `save.php`, `front_payment_cc.php` and `TreeMenu.php` files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application which could be executed in the browsers of other users. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could provide crafted input via the `stage` parameter in the request of `messages.php`, or the `pidList` variable in `save.php`, or the `ccaudit` variable in `front_payment_cc.php`, or the `nodeObj` in `TreeMenu.php` which is later output on the page without sanitization

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make requests with malicious data to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Details of the fix:**

*   The commit introduces the `text()` function to sanitize output in `messages.php`, `save.php`, and `front_payment_cc.php`. The `text()` function is assumed to HTML-encode the input.
*   The `jsAttr()` function is introduced to sanitize output in `TreeMenu.php` when outputting javascript attributes.
*   The changes prevent the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the application.

In summary, the provided commit addresses an XSS vulnerability by sanitizing output, using the functions `text()` and `jsAttr()`, to encode data before being rendered on the page.
