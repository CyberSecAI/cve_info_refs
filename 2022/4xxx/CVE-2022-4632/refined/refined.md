The provided content relates to a security fix for the `wp-auto-upload` WordPress plugin, specifically addressing XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in the settings form.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin's settings page was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of nonce verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS:** User-provided input in the settings form fields (like base URL, image name, alt name, max width, max height, excluded post types and excluded URLs) was not properly sanitized before being displayed, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
- **CSRF:** The settings form lacked protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting malicious requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Successful XSS exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the administrator's browser session, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **CSRF:** Successful CSRF exploitation could allow an attacker to manipulate the plugin's settings without the administrator's consent.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable settings form fields (base_url, image_name, alt_name, max_width, max_height, exclude_post_types, exclude_urls).
- **CSRF:** An attacker could craft a malicious form that targets the plugin's settings update endpoint, and trick a logged-in administrator to submit this form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- To exploit the XSS vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings form fields.
- To exploit the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into submitting a malicious form.
- The attacker does not require any elevated privileges initially. However, they will need to target a logged-in administrator to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**
The provided commit fixes this issue by:
- Implementing nonce verification with `check_admin_referer('aui_settings')`
- Sanitizing user inputs with `esc_attr()` and `esc_textarea()` before outputting them in the HTML and when saving to the database.
