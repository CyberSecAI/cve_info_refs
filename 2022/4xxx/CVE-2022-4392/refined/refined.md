- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The iPanorama 360 WordPress Virtual Tour Builder plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin doesn't sanitize or escape settings, allowing malicious script injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user interacts with the affected content (e.g., hovering over an image). This could lead to various actions like session hijacking, redirecting to malicious sites, or data theft.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript within a shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with Contributor+ role or higher is needed to create a post and insert a malicious shortcode. The attacker needs to entice another user to interact with the crafted post for the script to execute.
