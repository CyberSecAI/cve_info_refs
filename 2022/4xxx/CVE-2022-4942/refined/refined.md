Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a custom function `formatSourceCode` which was not properly escaping HTML characters in the issue messages and source code, leading to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The function `formatSourceCode` only replaced `<` with `&#60;` and `>` with `&#62;`, while other characters could still be used to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient escaping of user-controlled data before rendering it in HTML. The issue message, which can contain user-defined content was not properly sanitized.
- **Inadequate HTML escaping:** The custom escaping function `formatSourceCode` was not comprehensive enough to prevent XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the issue messages or source code through specially crafted input. When the report is rendered in a browser, this script would execute, potentially allowing the attacker to perform malicious actions like stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or modifying the page's content.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted issue messages:** An attacker could craft an issue message that contains malicious HTML/JavaScript code. If the reporter displays the message without proper escaping, the malicious script will execute when the report is viewed in a browser.
- **Crafted source code:** The source code is also displayed by the reporter. If this code contains malicious javascript and is not properly escaped, it could be used to perform an XSS attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of the issue messages, which may occur through an eslint rule, or source code included in the report.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the custom `formatSourceCode` function with the `_.escape` function from the Lodash library, which provides proper HTML escaping. This ensures that all potentially harmful characters are correctly converted to their HTML entities, preventing XSS attacks.
- The fix includes escaping the issue message during rendering.
- The fix includes escaping the source code before rendering.

The vulnerability was present in the `eslint-detailed-reporter` tool, specifically in the `lib/template-generator.js` file.
