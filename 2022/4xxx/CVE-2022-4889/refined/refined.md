The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4889.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied inputs when constructing SQL queries in the `getHistory` function of `api.php`. This is a classic case of SQL injection. Specifically, the `$symbol`, `$startDate`, and `$endDate` parameters taken from the GET request were directly inserted into the SQL query without proper escaping or using prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The original code was vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly embedded the values of `$symbol`, `$startDate`, and `$endDate` in the SQL query string without any sanitization. An attacker could manipulate these parameters to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Insecure direct object references:** The initial code used the symbol name as the database table, allowing direct access to any table name if the attacker knows it, bypassing intended access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including information about other users or internal application details.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially):** Depending on the database configuration, a successful SQL injection could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution on the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request parameters `symbol`, `startDate`, and `endDate` of the `api.php` script. By manipulating the values of these parameters, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`api.php`) and control the values of the `symbol`, `startDate`, and `endDate` parameters. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Mitigation:**
The commit `63e1b040373ee5b6c7d1e165ecf5ae1603d29e0a` addresses this by using `$pdo->quote()` on the input variables and later using prepared statements as seen in commit `1dc0d3a3331c5c5ec9eb0140c76a6359517472c7`. These are standard practices to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, the commits implement session checks on the API endpoints, which prevents access without proper authentication.
