The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4162.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize the `cg_row` POST parameter before using it in an SQL query within the `3_row-order.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection (SQLI). The unsanitized input allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially leak sensitive information from the site's database. The provided proof of concept also demonstrates the ability to cause a time-based blind SQL injection using the SLEEP() function.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically when the action is set to `post_cg_gallery_view_control_backend`. The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `cg_row` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have at least author-level privileges on the WordPress site.
