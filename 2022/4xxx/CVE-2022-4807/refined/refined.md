The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, and a generic footer from huntr.dev.

Based on the commit message "fix: access control", the changes in the commit seem to relate to access control fixes. The diff shows modifications to multiple files, primarily in the `api` and `server` directories, involving the removal of JSON tags (`json:"-"`) from struct fields. These tags are used to control how data is serialized and deserialized when using JSON. Specifically these fields are CreatorID in various API structs like `MemoCreate`, `ResourceCreate`, `ShortcutCreate`, and other fields like `MemoID` and `UserID` in struct definitions.

The changes are not directly related to CVE-2022-4807 which is a placeholder. The commit message suggests a fix for access control, however the provided content does not give enough context for specific vulnerability analysis.

Therefore:
