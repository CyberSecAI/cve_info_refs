Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `term-contact` viewlet in the `collective.contact.widget` was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it did not properly escape special characters in the contact title before storing it in a hidden field that was later used for dynamic JavaScript generation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability was the injection of malicious scripts through the contact title. By including special characters like `<` and `>` in the contact title, an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, leading to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session hijacking:** Through XSS, the attacker could potentially steal cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user and hijack their session.
- **Data theft:** The malicious JavaScript could potentially be used to steal sensitive information from the user's browser.
- **Phishing attacks:** An attacker could redirect users to a fake login page and steal their credentials.
- **Defacement of website:** The attacker could inject malicious content to deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the contact title field, which, if not properly sanitized, would allow the injection of malicious script.
- The vulnerable code is in the `term-contact` viewlet.
- By inserting a contact title that includes special characters, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control the content of the contact title, typically by creating or modifying a contact.
- The attacker would be able to insert or modify contact data on the application, with the ability to introduce malicious content in the contact's title field.
