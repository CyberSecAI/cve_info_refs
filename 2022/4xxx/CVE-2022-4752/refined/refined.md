- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a page/post containing the vulnerable shortcode. This could lead to actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by embedding a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in its attributes on a WordPress page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs at least contributor-level access to create or edit posts/pages and embed shortcodes. The attacker does not require a privileged position.
