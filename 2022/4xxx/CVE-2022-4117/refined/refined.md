Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`country_id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is an SQL Injection vulnerability (SQLi) due to the lack of input sanitization. This is classified as CWE-89.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to the database, potentially allowing an attacker to read, modify, or delete data. In this specific case, the provided PoC demonstrates the ability to cause a time delay, which is a characteristic of blind SQL injection and could be further exploited to extract data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through an AJAX action (`iws_gff_fetch_states`) that is accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.

**Summary:**

The IWS - Geo Form Fields WordPress plugin is vulnerable to an unauthenticated SQL injection. This is caused by unsanitized user input in the `country_id` parameter, which is used in a SQL query. An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted request, allowing for database interaction, such as reading data.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Plugin:** IWS - Geo Form Fields version 1.0 and below.
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.6 (High), indicating a significant risk.
*   **Proof of Concept:** A curl command is provided to demonstrate the time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **No Known Fix:** The content states that there is no known fix.
