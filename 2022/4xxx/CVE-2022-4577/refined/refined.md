- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that will execute when a user views it. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities against high privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in its attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site to be able to insert the malicious shortcode.
