- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate an attribute of one of its shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary redirect vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the shortcode attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can inject a malicious shortcode that redirects users to an arbitrary external domain, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with Contributor+ role can add a malicious shortcode to a page/post. The vulnerable shortcode is `ap-form-message` and the vulnerable attribute is `redirect`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role on the WordPress site to create a post or page that includes the malicious shortcode.
