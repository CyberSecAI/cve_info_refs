Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `createTable` function within the `com/ruoyi/generator/controller/GenController` class of the RuoYi framework. Specifically, the `sql` parameter, intended for creating database tables, is not properly sanitized against SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code attempts to filter SQL keywords using `SqlUtil.filterKeyword(sql)`, but this filter can be bypassed using comments (`/**/`). The code then directly passes the unfiltered SQL statement to the database for execution.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `SqlUtil.filterKeyword` is inadequate, allowing attackers to bypass the filter using techniques such as inline comments.
- **Error Message Exposure:** The code returns the raw exception message (`e.getMessage()`) to the user in case of an error. This can inadvertently leak sensitive database information or aid an attacker in further exploiting the system (error-based SQL injection).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, application secrets, and other sensitive information.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data stored in the database.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers could potentially disrupt database operations, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use error-based SQL injection to extract information about the database structure and its contents.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/tool/gen/createTable` endpoint.
- **`sql` Parameter:**  The malicious SQL payload is delivered through the `sql` parameter within the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the "admin" role to access the vulnerable endpoint due to the `@RequiresRoles("admin")` annotation.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload, particularly how to bypass filters.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) SQL injection payload: `sql=CREATE table ss1 as SELECT/**/* FROM sys_job WHERE 1=1 union/**/SELECT/**/extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,(select/**/version()),0x7e));`
- The vulnerability is present in RuoYi version 4.7.5.
-  The provided links point to a github repo named `ruoyi-4.7.5-vuln-poc`, which contains the vulnerable code and PoC details.
-  The issue was reported and fixed by removing spaces in the filter keywords and by abstracting the error messages.
