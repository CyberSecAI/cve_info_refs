- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin is vulnerable to XSS due to the lack of input sanitization on shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with contributor-level privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page/post via a shortcode attribute. This malicious code can then be executed in the browser of any user who views the affected page/post, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of high-privilege users (e.g., admins), steal cookies/session data, or redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a crafted shortcode containing malicious JavaScript into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a minimum of contributor privileges on the WordPress site to create and insert a crafted shortcode.
