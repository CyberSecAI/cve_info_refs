Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper escaping of user-controlled parameters when constructing HTML content for emails. Specifically, the `base-url` parameter was being directly injected into the HTML, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS vulnerability:** The code was vulnerable to XSS because it directly injected the `base-url` parameter into the `href` attribute of anchor tags within email templates without proper escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code if they can control the `base-url`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the email, which could be executed when the recipient views the email. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Manipulating the base URL:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `base-url` parameter, which is used to construct links in password reset or email verification emails. This could be done by:
    - Compromising a configuration file or setting where the base URL is set.
    - Intercepting requests that modify the base URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the `base-url` parameter used by the application to send email. This can be a configuration parameter that an attacker could modify, or an endpoint that an attacker can influence that would control the `base-url`.

**Changes made to address the vulnerability**
The code changes made in the commit `1f27f37c1a06f54a76971f70eaa6139dc139bdf9` included:
- Introducing `escape-email-params` function to escape HTML characters in email parameters.
- Modifying `send-email` function to use `escape-email-params` before generating the HTML.
- Updating the email template generation in `src/toto/site/user.clj` and `src/toto/view/auth.clj` to pass the `config` and other parameters into the escape function, specifically to correctly escape the `base-url` parameter.

These changes ensure that any user-controlled data used in the generation of the email's HTML is properly escaped, thus preventing XSS attacks.
