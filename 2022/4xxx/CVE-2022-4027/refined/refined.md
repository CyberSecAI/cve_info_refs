  "cve": "CVE-2022-4027",
  "description": "The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘postitem’ parameter manipulated during a forum response in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping that makes injecting object and embed tags possible. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages when responding to forum threads that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into forum replies that will execute when other users visit the affected pages.",
     "attack_vector": "The 'postitem' parameter is manipulated during a forum response.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to authenticate to inject the malicious code.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the 'postitem' parameter. Specifically, it allows the injection of object and embed tags."
