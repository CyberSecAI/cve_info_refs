## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CC Child Pages < 1.43 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit:
[child\_pages link\_target='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"']
Note: This should be added to a page and should be a parent page. So the page you add it to must be a child of it, as this lists the child pages.

### Affects Plugins
