The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4776.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `CC Child Pages` WordPress plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape shortcode attributes before displaying them on a page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation and output escaping of shortcode attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page through the plugin's shortcode.
- This malicious code can then be executed in the browsers of other users visiting the page, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement
  - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim, including privilege escalation if the victim is an administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using the `[child_pages]` shortcode with crafted malicious attributes, such as `link_target='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"'`.
- The shortcode must be used on a page that is a parent page, and the exploited page must be a child of it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have at least contributor level access to a WordPress site to be able to add/edit a page.
