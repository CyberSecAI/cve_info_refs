The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4508.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The ConvertKit WordPress plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page. If a high-privilege user, like an admin, views the page, the injected script will execute within their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to take over the admin's account.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the use of a crafted shortcode within a WordPress page or post. Specifically, the `convertkit_product` shortcode with malicious attributes is used. The vulnerable attributes are `text` and `text_color`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a user account with a role as low as a contributor. They also require registration with ConvertKit website, enter the API key in the plugin's settings, and add a product to get the product ID needed in the exploit shortcode.
