## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ConvertKit < 2.0.5 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escapes some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks, which could be used against high-privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit: [convertkit\_product product='1' text='XSS' text\_color='red" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
Note: The exploit requires registering on the CoverKit website, entering the API key in the settings, adding a product, and entering the CoverKit product id in the shortcode. The product can also be a draft; it does not need to be published.

### Affects Plugins
