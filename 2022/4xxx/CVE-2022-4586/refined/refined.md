Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities addressed in the commits, relating to CVE-2022-4586:

**Vulnerability 1: XSS in cachelists (OBB-217897)**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `cachelists.tpl` template file. Specifically, the `name_filter` and `by_filter` values were being directly inserted into the HTML without proper escaping.
*   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the browsers of other users who viewed the crafted page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious script into `name_filter` or `by_filter` values through the website interface.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs the ability to influence these input fields.

**Vulnerability 2: XSS on the home page (OBB-602216)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application was storing invalid country data in a cookie, which was then used to generate content on the home page without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Similar to the previous issue, an attacker could inject malicious script, affecting all users of the website.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is caused by setting an invalid country in a cookie. The malicious code would be executed when the home page is rendered with the invalid country.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to set invalid country values in a user's cookie.

**Mitigation:**

*   The fix for XSS in `cachelists.tpl` involves applying the `escape` modifier to the `name_filter` and `by_filter` variables before inserting them into HTML:  `{$name_filter|escape}` and `{$by_filter|escape}`
*   The fix for XSS on home page involved not storing invalid country values into the cookie, thus preventing the malicious code from being executed.
*  The fix also validates the country value in newcaches.php to prevent invalid country values.
