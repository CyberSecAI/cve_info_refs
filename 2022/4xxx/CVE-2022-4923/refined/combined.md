We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[1301878]](https://crbug.com/1301878) Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).

Interested in switching release channels? Find out how [here](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](https://www.crbug.com). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
