- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the browsers of other users, including administrators, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By using a specific shortcode with a malicious `class` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with a Contributor role or higher can insert the malicious shortcode into a post or page. The malicious code will be triggered when an administrator views the content.
