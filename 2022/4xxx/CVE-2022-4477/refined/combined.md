## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Smash Balloon Social Post Feed < 4.1.6 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escapes some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged-in admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. Connect Facebook and a Facebook Page to the plugin.
2. Exploit shortcode:
[custom-facebook-feed feed='1' class='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']

### Affects Plugins
