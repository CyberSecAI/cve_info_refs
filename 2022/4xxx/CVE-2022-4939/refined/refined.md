**Summary:** The provided content describes CVE-2022-4939, an unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability in the WCFM Membership WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `wp_ajax_nopriv_wcfm_ajax_controller` AJAX action within the WCFM Membership plugin. This action controls membership settings, and the lack of proper authorization allows unauthenticated users to modify the membership registration form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of capability checks on the `wp_ajax_nopriv_wcfm_ajax_controller` AJAX action, which allows unauthenticated users to access and manipulate sensitive membership settings.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying the membership registration form, attackers can set the default registration user role to that of any user, including administrators.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Complete compromise of the WordPress site:** After setting the administrator role, the attacker can register a new account with administrative privileges, gaining full control over the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Data Breach:** With full admin access, the attacker can potentially modify and delete content, access sensitive data, install malicious plugins, and perform other actions detrimental to the site.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:**  No authentication is needed, making the attack very easy to execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs no specific user account or prior access to the vulnerable WordPress site. They only need to send a specially crafted request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
