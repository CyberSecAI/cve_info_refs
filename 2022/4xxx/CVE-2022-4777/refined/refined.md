**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper sanitization of shortcode attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page or post through shortcode attributes.
- When an admin or other user views the affected page or post, the malicious JavaScript will execute in their browser.
- This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a malicious shortcode within a post/page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level access to create posts/pages.
- The attacker relies on another user (e.g., an administrator) to view the malicious post/page and trigger the injected JavaScript.
