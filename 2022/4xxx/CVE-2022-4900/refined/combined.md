| Description In the file `sapi/cli/php_cli_server.c`, the function `php_cli_server_startup_workers` has the following [code](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/56804e32216574c66cf71359a8a8830e7badc757/sapi/cli/php_cli_server.c#L2413):  ``` void php_cli_server_startup_workers(void) {     char *workers = getenv("PHP_CLI_SERVER_WORKERS");     if (!workers) {         return;     }     php_cli_server_workers_max = ZEND_ATOL(workers);           if (php_cli_server_workers_max > 1) {          php_cli_server_workers = calloc( 			php_cli_server_workers_max, sizeof(pid_t));         ...     } }  ```  The variable `php_cli_server_workers_max` is parsed from environment variable and thus is controlled. When setting `php_cli_server_workers_max` to a large value (e.g., `INT64_MAX`), the multiplication `php_cli_server_workers_max * sizeof(pid_t)` could wrap to a small value. A buffer smaller than expected will be allocated and this can lead to subsequent buffer overflow.  Notice that the C standard does not clearly states that `calloc` will check for multiplication overflow itself (see [here](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/MEM07-C.%2BEnsure%2Bthat%2Bthe%2Barguments%2Bto%2Bcalloc%28%29%2C%2Bwhen%2Bmultiplied%2C%2Bdo%2Bnot%2Bwrap)). It will be better to also restrict the maximum value for `php_cli_server_workers_max` in the code. PHP Version github master Operating System *No response* |

| I agree that this should be improved, but setting a very large number is unlikely to work anyway, or is it?  With a very large number for `php_cli_server_workers_max`, the actual buffer size of `php_cli_server_workers` is actually a small value due to the wrap-around. Then the following loop can lead to out of bound buffer access (only require `fork` to succeed for a small number of times):  ``` for (php_cli_server_worker = 0;        php_cli_server_worker < php_cli_server_workers_max;        php_cli_server_worker++) {     pid_t pid = fork();     if (pid < 0) { 	/* no more forks allowed, work with what we have ... */ 	php_cli_server_workers_max = 	php_cli_server_worker + 1; 	return;     } else if (pid == 0) { 	return;     } else { 	php_cli_server_workers[php_cli_server_worker] = pid;     } }  ``` |
