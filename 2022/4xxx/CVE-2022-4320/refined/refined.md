- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites. The vulnerability affects both unauthenticated and authenticated users, including administrators.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a specific parameter value, an attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick the user into opening that URL. No specific access level is needed, as the vulnerability impacts both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
