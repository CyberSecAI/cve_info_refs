The provided content describes a SQL Injection vulnerability in the "Bitcoin / AltCoin Payment Gateway" WordPress plugin, affecting versions prior to 1.7.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability (CWE-89)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. The provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection, where an attacker can induce a delay in the response from the server using `SLEEP()`. While the provided example only demonstrates a delay, the attacker could potentially extract sensitive data, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the system depending on the database permissions and configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically the `_cs_wapg_custom_call` action. The `order` parameter is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They need to extract a CSRF token (nonce) from the website source code, and then send a crafted request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the malicious `order` parameter and the extracted nonce.
