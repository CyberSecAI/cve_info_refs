Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Content from github.com:**

The provided content is a diff of a commit to the `usememos/memos` repository on GitHub. This commit, identified by the hash `3556ae4e651d9443dc3bb8a170dd3cc726517a53`, is titled "fix: access control" and includes changes across multiple files related to the API and server logic.

**Vulnerability Related Information:**
While the commit title suggests an access control fix, the code diffs themselves don't directly show the vulnerability.  The changes primarily involve:

-   Removing the `json:"-"` tag from some struct fields. This means that these fields, previously ignored during JSON serialization/deserialization, will now be included.
    -   Examples include `CreatorID` in `MemoCreate`, `ID` in `MemoFind`, `CreatorID` in `ResourceCreate` etc.
-   Some minor adjustments in type definitions.
-   Some minor changes in the auth logic, especially around user sign-up and host user handling.

**Impact of the Changes:**
- The commit seems focused on enforcing proper access control by ensuring that certain user IDs (such as CreatorID), previously ignored, are now correctly handled in the application's data structures.

**Lack of Specific Vulnerability Information:**
- The diff does not explicitly reveal the previous vulnerability; however, the title `fix: access control` combined with the removal of the `json:"-"` tag on fields like `CreatorID` suggests that the vulnerability may have involved the unintended access or manipulation of entities due to improperly handled user IDs or other related fields. This is an educated guess based on the nature of the changes, but more detail would be required from the CVE description.
- There is no clear attack vector described. The changes suggest that before the fix, there might have been an access control bypass issue, possibly allowing unauthorized access or modification of resources.
- The commit also includes some minor correction in error messages related to user sign-up which may have indirectly related to access control in previous versions.

**Content from huntr.dev:**

The content from huntr.dev is a generic page footer and does not provide any information related to a specific CVE. It does mention "Bounties", which might suggest a platform for reporting and fixing vulnerabilities, but without further information, it is not relevant to this CVE analysis.

**Summary:**

Based on the provided content, the commit titled "fix: access control" in `usememos/memos` repository likely addresses an access control vulnerability, potentially caused by the improper handling or serialization/deserialization of fields like `CreatorID`. However, without explicit description of the vulnerability the exact nature of the vulnerability is not possible to determine. The huntr.dev content is unrelated to CVE-2022-4863.
