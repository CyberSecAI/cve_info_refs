- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to induce a time delay, suggesting the possibility of blind SQL injection attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable via the `multiple_invoices[]` parameter in the `wp-admin/admin.php` page when `web_invoice_action=clear_log` is set.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the capability to manage invoices. By default, this is an administrator, but the plugin's configuration may grant this privilege to other roles, such as subscriber.
