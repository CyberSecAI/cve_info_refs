*   **CSRF:** The application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The CSRF vulnerability is leveraged to achieve RCE by uploading a malicious file to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to:
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** A malicious user can upload a file to the target's server.
*  **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious file, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by a logged-in user, triggers a file upload request.
*  **User Interaction Required:** The attack depends on user interaction. The victim needs to click on the crafted link for the CSRF attack to be successful

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Attacker can craft a malicious link.**
*   **Attacker needs a logged in user to click the link**
