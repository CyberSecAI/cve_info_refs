## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Eventify <= 2.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Settings » Eventify.
2. Under 'Category Slug For Events Saved As Blog Posts' add payload: '"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script><'" and Update Category Slug to get the XSS trigger.

### Affects Plugins
