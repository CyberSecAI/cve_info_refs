- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An administrator or high-privilege user can inject the malicious payload via the plugin's settings page, specifically under the 'Category Slug For Events Saved As Blog Posts' option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrator or other high-privilege access to the WordPress dashboard to modify the plugin's settings.
