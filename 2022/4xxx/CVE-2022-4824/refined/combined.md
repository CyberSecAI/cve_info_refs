## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Blog and Widget < 2.3.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Note: First, you need to add a Blog Post at http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=blog\_post
Exploit shortcode:
[recent\_blog\_post grid='1" onmouseover="alert(1)"']

### Affects Plugins
