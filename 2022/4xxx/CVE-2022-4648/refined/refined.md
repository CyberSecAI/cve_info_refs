- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page which could be executed by other users, including high-privileged users like admins. This could lead to privilege escalation and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting the vulnerable shortcode attribute, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with contributor level access can exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to create content that can use the vulnerable shortcode (e.g. creating a post).
