## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Appointments < 3.11.2 - Contributor+ Stored XSS in Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[ea\_full\_calendar column\_header\_format="'}); alert(1); jQuery('#xss').fullCalendar({xssVulnerable:'yes"]
