- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them to the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially allowing them to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf. This could be used against high privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerability involves inserting a malicious payload in a shortcode attribute (e.g., class attribute) within a page. The provided proof of concept is `[list-pages class='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.
