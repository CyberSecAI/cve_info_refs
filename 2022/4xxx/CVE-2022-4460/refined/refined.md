Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post where the shortcode is embedded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to Stored XSS due to the lack of input sanitization/escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page or post.
- This code will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected page/post, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the use of the plugin's shortcode feature.
- An attacker inserts a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in an attribute (in this case, `el_class`).
- When a user views the page/post, the injected script is executed by the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level privileges to create posts or pages containing the crafted shortcode.
- No other specific requirements or vulnerabilities required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable plugin is "Sidebar Widgets by CodeLights" with versions equal to or less than 1.4.
- The proof of concept shortcode is: `[cl-review el_class='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']`
