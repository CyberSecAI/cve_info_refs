- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Lightbox Gallery plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the plugin is vulnerable to XSS via its shortcode attributes due to insufficient sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page or post, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who view the page/post. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as stealing user cookies, redirecting to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted shortcode, specifically by injecting malicious code into the 'class' attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor role privileges on the WordPress site to be able to create/modify posts or pages with the malicious shortcode.
