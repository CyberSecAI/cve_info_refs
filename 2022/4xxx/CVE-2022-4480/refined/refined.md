- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization/escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers, including those with administrative privileges. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or the execution of malicious actions on the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by using a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in the `pre_filled` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Contributor-level or higher access to the WordPress site, which allows them to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.
