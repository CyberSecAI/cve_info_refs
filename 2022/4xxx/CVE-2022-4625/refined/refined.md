- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of other users, including administrators, when they view the affected page, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted shortcode inserted by a user with Contributor or higher role. Specifically, the `login_logout_class` attribute is vulnerable to XSS injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with Contributor or higher role.
