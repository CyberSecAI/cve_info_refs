- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape user-supplied input in form fields like 'Step Title', 'Step Headline', 'Step description', and 'Sections' when creating or editing forms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they view or interact with the affected forms. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have admin level access to the WordPress dashboard of a website using the vulnerable plugin, then create/edit a form using the Multi Step Form plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: High privilege users such as administrators are required to create/edit a form and insert malicious scripts into the vulnerable fields.
