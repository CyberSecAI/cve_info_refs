## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress Filter Gallery Plugin < 0.1.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly escape the filters passed in the ufg\_gallery\_filters ajax action before outputting them on the page, allowing a high privileged user such as an administrator to inject HTML or javascript to the plugin settings page, even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disabled.

### Proof of Concept

Create a new filter with the name "<svg onload('alert(123);')>", save it and reload the page.

### Affects Plugins
