- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Filter Gallery plugin does not properly sanitize or escape filter names passed through the `ufg_gallery_filters` AJAX action before displaying them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (e.g., administrator) can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the plugin settings page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection of users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious code through the filter name input, which is then stored and displayed on the plugin settings page. The vulnerability is triggered when a high-privilege user views this settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user such as an administrator to create a filter.
