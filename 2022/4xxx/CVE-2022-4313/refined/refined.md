Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-4313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied values for scan variables within built-in audit files. This allows an authenticated user with the "Scan Policy Configuration" role to manipulate these variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insufficient input validation: The core issue is that user-provided values for scan variables are not checked against defined types, allowing for injection of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the credentialed scan targets. This can lead to a complete compromise of the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Manipulation of scan variables: An attacker exploits the vulnerability by modifying the scan variables within a built-in audit policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication: The attacker must be an authenticated user of Tenable products (Tenable.sc, Tenable.io, Nessus).
- "Scan Policy Configuration" role: The attacker needs to have the "Scan Policy Configuration" role which is required to modify scan policies.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only affects built-in audits selected via product interfaces and does not include custom audits uploaded by the customer.
- The fix involves updated compliance plugins and audit files that perform validation of user-entered values against defined variable types.
- Tenable has released updated plugins via the Tenable plugin feed 202212081952 or later.
- Tenable.sc updates are distributed in the feed and activated when the customer uses the new template.
- Nessus version 10.4.2 or later will have the updated audit content.
- Users of earlier versions can perform a manual update of the audit warehouse.
- The advisory has a CVSSv3 base score of 9.1 and a temporal score of 8.2, indicating a critical severity level.
- The vulnerability was reported to Tenable on 2022-08-25, confirmed as valid on 2022-09-01, and fixes were deployed across multiple products by 2023-03-10.
