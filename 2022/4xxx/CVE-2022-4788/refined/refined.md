- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode with a payload in the attributes and embedding it into a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
