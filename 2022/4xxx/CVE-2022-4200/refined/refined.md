- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin allows high-privilege users, such as administrators, to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database. These scripts can then be executed when other users view the affected settings page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed when a user views the affected settings page. This can lead to the attacker taking control of the administrator account and performing malicious actions on the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's settings pages, specifically in "Cognito Login Â» Attribute/Role Mapping" in the Username field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as an administrator account, to access and modify the vulnerable settings.
