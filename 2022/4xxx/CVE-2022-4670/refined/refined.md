- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a page or post that will execute when a user views it, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted shortcode with a malicious `onmouseover` attribute, an attacker can inject JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to WordPress to create or edit posts and embed shortcodes.
