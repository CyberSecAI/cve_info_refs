- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement via an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information, such as usernames and password hashes, by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is accessible through an AJAX action available to unauthenticated users. The attacker needs to extract the nonce from the source of a blog post and use it in a crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication. They need to be able to access the blog post to extract the nonce and send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
