## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Pardakht Delkhah < 2.9.3 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, allowing unauthenticated attackers to send a request with XSS payloads, which will be triggered when a high privilege users such as admin visits a page from the plugin.

### Proof of Concept

1. Install and activate WoocCommerce (dependency, no configuration required)
2. Install the vulnerable plugin (pardakht-delkhah 2.9.2)
3. Under plugin's menu, "Custom payment" > "Gateway Settings", hit the save button to set the default gateway.
4. Invoke the following curl request to store two XSS payloads (both of which will trigger an alert box:
curl http://localhost:10008/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php \
--data 'action=cupri\_action&cupri\_fmobile=981111111111&cupri\_fprice="><script>alert(`xss1`)</script>&cupri\_f0="><script>alert(`xss2`)</script>'
5. The XSS will be triggered when an admin navigates to the plugin's menu (/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=cupri\_pay)
