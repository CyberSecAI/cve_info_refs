{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will be executed when a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, visits the plugin's page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with XSS payloads in the `cupri_fprice` and `cupri_f0` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need authentication to send a crafted request and inject the payload. The attacker must know the plugin's ajax endpoint."
