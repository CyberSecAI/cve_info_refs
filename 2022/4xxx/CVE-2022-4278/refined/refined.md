Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-4278 (as referenced in the README.md)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation on the `empid` parameter in the `/hrm/employeeadd.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The absence of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `empid` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. The provided proof of concept shows successful SQL injection with `sleep()` command which could lead to denial of service or further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `/hrm/employeeadd.php` by supplying a crafted `empid` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Access to the `/hrm/employeeadd.php` URL, which is accessible to a logged-in admin user, is required to exploit the vulnerability
- Basic understanding of SQL and HTTP requests is required.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The content provides a detailed proof of concept with `sleep()` function. This allows for easy confirmation of the SQL injection by observing the delay in the response time
- The vulnerable product is identified as "SourceCodester Human Resource Management System 1.0".
- The specific vulnerable file is `/hrm/employeeadd.php`.
- The affected parameter is `empid`.
- The content also shows proof using MySQL logs.

The provided content gives sufficient information about the vulnerability.
