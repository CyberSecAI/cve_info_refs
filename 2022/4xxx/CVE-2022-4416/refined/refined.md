Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `${}` in the `queryReposMemberWithParamLike` function within the `ReposAuthMapper.xml` file. This method of parameter substitution does not perform any form of precompilation or sanitization, which allows for direct injection of SQL code into the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability due to the direct use of user-controlled input in the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries. Specifically, the `searchWord` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements/Parameter Binding:** The code fails to use prepared statements or parameter binding, leading to the SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data within the database.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information could be exposed, including user credentials and application data.
- **Database Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data, leading to data loss or corruption.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the database user's permissions and other factors, a successful SQL injection could potentially lead to the compromise of the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the `searchWord` parameter within a POST request to the `/DocSystem/Repos/getReposAllUsers.do` endpoint.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests (POST) and parameters.
- **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** While the example demonstrates exploitation without authentication via the guest/guest login, other scenarios may require an attacker to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept demonstrating the SQL injection, using `searchWord=*` to trigger the vulnerability.
- The issue was reported by `jyh_yyds`.
- The vulnerability is located in the DocSys project and the fix appears to involve replacing `${}` with `#{}` in the `ReposAuthMapper.xml` file, which implies parameter binding/prepared statement use.
- The content also mentions that other interfaces using like statements also have similar issues.
