- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape one of its shortcode attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting a crafted shortcode with a malicious payload into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least contributor access to the WordPress site to be able to add a post/page containing the malicious shortcode.
