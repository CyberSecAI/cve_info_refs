- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in Delta Electronics' CNCSoft software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is described as having "low attack complexity", and while the advisory states it is not exploitable remotely, the vulnerability is caused by a network exposure issue. A user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable software or system. The advisory states that the exploitation is not remote which may indicate the requirement for local network access.
