{
  "CVE-2022-4283": {
    "description": "The XkbCopyNames function left a dangling pointer to freed memory, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access on subsequent XkbGetKbdByName requests.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "xorg-x11-server",
      "xorg-x11-server-Xwayland",
	  "tigervnc"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `XkbGetKbdByName` function within the X.Org X server. The vulnerability is caused by the `XkbCopyNames` function which leaves a dangling pointer to freed memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "This flaw can lead to local privilege elevation on systems where the X server runs privileged. It can lead to remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions. If the X server does not run with root privileges, impact is less severe.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local exploitation",
        "Remote code execution via X forwarding"
      ],
	  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need a method to trigger the `XkbGetKbdByName` function after a memory region has been freed. Local user would need to exploit a vulnerability or have the ability to interact with the X server. Remote exploitation would require an X forwarding session."
