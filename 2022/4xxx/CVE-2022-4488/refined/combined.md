## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Widgets on Pages < 1.8.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

[widgets\_on\_pages tiny="' onmouseover='alert(/XSS/)' style='background:red;width:100px;height:100px;'"]
All attributes are affected: tiny, id, small, medium, large, wide

### Affects Plugins
