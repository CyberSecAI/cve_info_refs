Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Widgets on Pages" does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious scripts injected through the plugin's shortcode attributes are stored in the database and executed when the page is rendered for other users.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize shortcode attributes, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users visiting the affected pages. This can lead to:
    *   **Account Takeover:**  Stealing session cookies or other sensitive data to hijack user accounts.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or triggering the download of malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the website visible to the victim.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms or other elements to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious code through the attributes of the plugin's shortcodes (e.g., `tiny`, `id`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `wide`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Contributor Role:** An attacker only needs a user account with the WordPress "Contributor" role or higher. This role allows users to create and edit posts, which can include using shortcodes.

**Technical Details:**
*   The proof of concept shows how the `onmouseover` event is triggered when the mouse hovers over the element, demonstrating the successful execution of injected JavaScript.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the "Widgets on Pages" plugin prior to 1.8.0.
*   The payload provided is `[widgets\_on\_pages tiny="' onmouseover='alert(/XSS/)' style='background:red;width:100px;height:100px;'"]` which includes an arbitrary javascript alert box.
