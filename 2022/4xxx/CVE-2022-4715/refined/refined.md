- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which will be executed when a user views the page. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites. In this specific case, it's noted that a user with "Contributor" role can execute this, thus affecting higher privileged users.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific shortcode that includes malicious JavaScript code in its attributes. The provided proof of concept shows this through the use of the 'onmouseover' attribute inside of a crafted shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a WordPress account with at least "Contributor" level access. They would need to be able to create or edit content which allows the use of shortcodes.
