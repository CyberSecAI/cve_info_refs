## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Subscribe2 < 10.38 - User Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check when deleting users, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin delete arbitrary users by knowing their email via a CSRF attack.

Note: Attackers won't be able to delete the user making the CSRF request.

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged-in admin open the below URL to delete the user with the user@domain.com address:
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=s2\_tools&tab=registered&action=delete&paged=1&subscriber%5B%5D=user@domain.com&action2=delete
