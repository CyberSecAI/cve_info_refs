- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin does not validate and escape shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities. This can affect high privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious shortcode with a JavaScript payload in the `design` attribute and inserting this shortcode into a WordPress post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have contributor or higher role privileges to create content containing the malicious shortcode.
