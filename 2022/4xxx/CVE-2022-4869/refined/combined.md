HideSensitiveMiddleware: Hide passwords on middleware errors

```
It turns out that an exception in middleware (such as a CSRF failure)
can bypass the hiding of sensitive post parameters (e.g. passwords in
the login form).

This adds a middleware that ensures that (unless the view specifies
differently), the 'password' parameter is always hidden from error
output (and for views that *do* specify differently, it is hidden also
before the view is executed).

Part of this (view middleware) could be fixed in Django
<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/33090>, but this new middleware
adds a bit more protection for exceptions before the view is even known.
```
