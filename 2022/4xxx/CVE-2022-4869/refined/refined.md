The provided content relates to a fix for a potential information disclosure vulnerability, although it does not directly describe a CVE. The commit addresses the issue where sensitive POST parameters, such as passwords, could be exposed in error outputs when exceptions occur in Django middleware before the view is executed.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Exceptions in Django middleware, such as CSRF failures, could bypass the mechanism that hides sensitive POST parameters (like passwords) from error outputs.
- Django's built-in mechanism to hide sensitive post parameters is on a per-view basis and isn't triggered before the view is known. This means that if an error happens in the middleware before the view is called, the parameters would be exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure of sensitive data in error messages/outputs. Specifically, passwords or other sensitive POST parameters could be inadvertently logged, displayed, or otherwise exposed when an exception occurs in middleware before the view is executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information (e.g., passwords) if an attacker triggers an exception in the middleware.
- Potential for credential theft if error logs are not properly secured.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering exceptions in middleware before the view is executed, such as by providing an invalid CSRF token or other malformed requests that trigger middleware exceptions.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in middleware that may cause exceptions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send requests that trigger middleware exceptions.
- An understanding of the application's middleware and potential points of failure.
- Access to error logs or outputs where sensitive information may be revealed.

**Mitigation:**
- Implementation of a custom middleware (`HideSensitiveMiddleware`) that ensures that specific POST parameters ('password' in this case) are always hidden before any view is executed, thus protecting against leaks even when middleware exceptions occur.
- The middleware is added to the beginning of the `MIDDLEWARE` list to maximize coverage.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit mentions that this is partially a workaround for a Django issue ([https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/33090](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/33090)), however, it provides additional protection.
- The fix explicitly sets `request.sensitive_post_parameters = ['password']` before calling the next middleware, ensuring this masking happens before any view logic.
