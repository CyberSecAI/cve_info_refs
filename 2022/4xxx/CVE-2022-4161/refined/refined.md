  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not escape the `cg_copy_start` POST parameter before concatenating it to an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (SQLI). Specifically, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code via the `cg_copy_start` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Malicious users can leak sensitive information from the site's database.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the vulnerable `cg_copy_start` parameter.",
