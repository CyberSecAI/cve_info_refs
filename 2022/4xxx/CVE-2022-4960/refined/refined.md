The content provided describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `favorites-web` project, as reported in issue #127.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when registering a new user's nickname. Specifically, the application allows users to input malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into user nicknames, which is then stored and executed within the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected content (e.g., comments). This can lead to various malicious actions like session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the XSS payload during user registration when setting a nickname.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to register an account on the application.
