- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Download Manager plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user with Contributor role can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when an admin views the page, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted `wpdm_modal_login_form` shortcode with malicious JavaScript in the `class` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in the WordPress site and the "Enable modal login form" option needs to be enabled in plugin settings.
