## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Download Manager < 3.2.62 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escapes some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged-in admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. “Enable modal login form” option in the “Downloads > Settings > Frontend Access > Front-end Settings” section.
2. Exploit shortcode:
[wpdm\_modal\_login\_form class='" onmouseover="alert(1)']
