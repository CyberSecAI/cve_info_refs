Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the `Sisimai::String.to_plain` function. This function is used to convert HTML content to plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The `to_plain` method used regular expressions to remove HTML tags. Specifically, the regex `plain.gsub!(%r|<a\s+href\s\*=\s\*['"](https?://.+?)['"].\*?>(.\*?)</a>|i, '[\2](\1)')` and `plain.gsub!(%r|<a\s+href\s\*=\s\*["']mailto:([^\s]+?)["']>(.\*?)</a>|i, '[\2](mailto:\1)')` were vulnerable to ReDoS.
*   The regex used unbounded quantifiers (`.+?`) within the lookahead and capture groups, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted, malicious HTML content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A specially crafted HTML email body can cause the `to_plain` method to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email with a specifically crafted HTML body to an application that uses `rb-sisimai` and calls the `to_plain` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send an email with a malicious HTML body to a system that is using the vulnerable `rb-sisimai` library and calls the vulnerable `to_plain` method.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified and fixed by a patch provided by `gmcabrita`
*   The fix was merged into the `master` branch of the `rb-sisimai` repository.
*   The fix was also imported into the `p5-sisimai` repository.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in the `v4.25.14p12` release.
*   The provided content includes links to the specific commit that fixes the vulnerability.
