Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `keter` application, when encountering an unrecognized host, would display a default error message which included the provided host in the HTML without proper sanitization, thus leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to XSS because the host value was inserted directly into the HTML response without escaping/sanitizing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code via the `host` field, which could then be executed in a victim's browser when they accessed the error page. This could allow the attacker to:
   - Steal cookies
   - Redirect users to malicious websites
   - Perform actions on behalf of the user
   - Deface the webpage.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to make an HTTP request to the `keter` application with a crafted `Host` header containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `keter` application.
- No special user privileges are needed.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involved escaping the host string before inserting it into the HTML.
- The vulnerability was reported by Max @ulidtko.
- The fix was included in `keter` version `1.8.2`.
