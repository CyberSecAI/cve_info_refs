### @jappeace **[jappeace](/jappeace)** commented [Apr 19, 2022](#issue-1208356616)

The host field can be spoofed,

which allows an xss attack.

Eg you can put a bunch of javascript

(or whatever html) in the hostfield and

response to trick the user.

These chagnes make that impossible.

add changelog, bump cabal

Sorry, something went wrong.
