Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4838:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Clean Login WordPress plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before displaying them on a page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied input in shortcode attributes, allowing malicious code to be stored in the database and executed when the page is rendered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who visit the affected page.
- This allows attackers to potentially steal cookies/session tokens, perform actions on behalf of other users, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or install malware.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by low-privilege users like contributors, potentially impacting high-privilege users such as admins.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious shortcode using the `clean-login-register` shortcode and injecting it into a page or post.
- The shortcode attribute, such as `role` in the example provided, can contain malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role on the WordPress site to create a post or page using the vulnerable shortcode.
- The attacker also needs the "Choose the role(s) in the registration form?" option to be enabled in the Clean Login settings.
- The exploit only works and appears if the victim is not logged in to the website.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.13.7 of the Clean Login plugin.
- The provided proof of concept uses the following shortcode: `[clean-login-register role='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="display:block !important; background:red;"']`
- The `onmouseover` attribute injects Javascript code that will execute if the user hovers over the element where the shortcode has been placed
