- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim or steal sensitive information. A lower privilege user like a contributor can perform this attack which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode and adding it to a post or page, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a user account on the vulnerable WordPress site with at least the contributor role.
