- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks when deleting a template, and it doesn't verify if the post to be deleted is actually a template.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization and CSRF checks leading to arbitrary post deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Any authenticated user (e.g., a subscriber) can delete arbitrary posts if they know the post's slug. This can result in data loss and potential website defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (at least a subscriber) and know the slug of the post they want to delete.
