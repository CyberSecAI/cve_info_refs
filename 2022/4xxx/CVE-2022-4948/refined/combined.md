# WordPress FlyingPress plugin fixed broken access control vulnerability.

* by [NinTechNet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/nintechnet/)
* Posted on [November 28, 2022 - 12:13pm [+0700]November 28, 2022 - 12:17pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-flyingpress-plugin-fixed-broken-access-control-vulnerability/)

The WordPress [FlyingPress](https://flying-press.com/) plugin fixed an authenticated broken access control vulnerability affecting version 3.9.6 and below.

### Broken Access Control

CVSS v3.1: [7.6 (High)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L)

The plugin registers nine different AJAX actions in the FlyingPress\Ajax::init method. They all lack a capability check and a security nonce, allowing an authenticated user to interact with the plugin.

Among those actions, `save_config` is used to save the plugin configuration, which includes an option to use an external CDN. When enabled, the plugin rewrites static files URL (e.g., JavaScript, CSS) to deliver them from the CDN instead of the current domain.

An authenticated user such as a subscriber or a WooCommerce customer could use that AJAX action to enable the CDN feature and replace the source of static elements by injecting a rogue domain, which could be used to redirect all traffic to an external malicious site for instance:

The domain will be injected into all pages and posts in the front-end.

### Recommendations

Update immediately if you have version 3.9.6 or below installed. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

### Timeline

The issue was reported to the developers on October 05, 2022 and a new version 3.9.7 was released on November 14, 2022.

### Description

The FlyingPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on its AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 3.9.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to interact with the plugin in ways administrators are intended to. One action (save\_config) allows for the configuration of an external CDN. This could be used to include malicious javascript from a source controlled by the attacker.
