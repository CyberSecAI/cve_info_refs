Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4948:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check on AJAX actions within the WordPress FlyingPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin's `FlyingPress\Ajax::init` method registers nine different AJAX actions without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of authorization checks (capability checks) and security nonces for AJAX actions. This allows any authenticated user, even those with low privileges, to interact with these actions.
- **Missing Authorization:**  As stated in the Wordfence description, the vulnerability is classified as "Missing Authorization."
- **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The absence of security nonces makes the AJAX actions vulnerable to CSRF attacks, though the provided text does not specify if this is exploited as part of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Configuration Changes:** An attacker can exploit the `save_config` AJAX action to enable the CDN feature. They can then inject a rogue domain into the plugin's settings which will cause the plugin to rewrite static file URLs, redirecting traffic to an attacker controlled server.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Injection:** By injecting a malicious CDN domain, the attacker can control the source of static elements. This would allow them to inject malicious JavaScript into the frontend of the website, potentially leading to XSS attacks, redirection, and other malicious activities.
- **Website Compromise:**  The attacker can achieve redirection of all traffic to an external malicious site, potentially leading to phishing or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network based and remote, as it involves sending an AJAX request to the vulnerable server.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, but does not require administrative access.  User roles such as subscriber or WooCommerce customer are sufficient.
- **AJAX Request Manipulation:**  The attacker manipulates the parameters of the `save_config` AJAX action to inject their malicious CDN domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress User Account:** The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site, with at least the subscriber role.
- **Knowledge of AJAX action:** The attacker needs to know the `save_config` action and how to manipulate the associated parameters.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server, such as using curl or a similar tool.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects versions 3.9.6 and below of the FlyingPress plugin.
- It was patched in version 3.9.7.
- The vulnerability was reported to the developers on October 5, 2022, and the patch was released on November 14, 2022.
- The CVSS score assigned is 7.6 (High) by NinTechNet and 4.3 (Medium) by Wordfence, though they use different CVSS vectors. NinTechNet uses a vector with `UI:R`, suggesting the user has to do some kind of interaction other than sending a request, while Wordfence uses a vector with `UI:N`.
