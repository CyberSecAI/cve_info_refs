Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page. Specifically, the `pmpro_signup` shortcode allows for attributes that can be injected with malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS.  Malicious script can be injected via the shortcode attributes and stored in the database, then executed when a page containing the shortcode is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to:
  - Steal session cookies and hijack user accounts.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user, including modifying content, changing settings, or performing administrative tasks.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted shortcode. Specifically, the `pmpro_signup` shortcode accepts attributes that can be used to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Contributor Role or Higher:** A user with at least the "Contributor" role in WordPress can create or edit posts that include shortcodes. The attacker would need the ability to create or edit content to inject the malicious shortcode.
- **No Specific privileges needed:** The content indicates that the vulnerability allows a "Contributor" to inject the malicious script. The vulnerability is exploitable by low privilege users, and the stored XSS can be used against high privilege users, such as admins.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable plugin is "Custom User Profile Fields for User Registration & Member Frontend Profiles with Paid Memberships Pro."
- The vulnerable version is any version prior to 1.8.1.
- The exploit uses `[pmpro\_signup button='XSS" onmouseover="alert(1)"']` as the proof of concept.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8.1.
