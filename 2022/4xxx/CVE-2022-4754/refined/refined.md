Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Easy Social Box WordPress plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page or post. This allows for the injection of malicious code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites, which are made possible through the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is triggered through the injection of a malicious payload within the shortcode attributes of the vulnerable plugin. For instance, `[easy-fb-like-box locale='"; alert(1); var xss="']` is used to demonstrate the XSS. The injection occurs when a user with the Contributor role or higher adds the malicious shortcode in the post/page content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role, allowing them to create or edit posts and pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.
