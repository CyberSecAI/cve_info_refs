## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Collapse-O-Matic < 1.8.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit shortcode:
[expand elwraptag='div' elwrapclass='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']

### Affects Plugins
