The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4475.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which can then be executed by other users, including those with administrative privileges. This can lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by inserting a malicious payload within the shortcode attributes. Specifically, the `elwraptag` and `elwrapclass` attributes are not being sanitized, allowing for the injection of the `onmouseover` event.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least the contributor role in WordPress to insert the malicious shortcode.
