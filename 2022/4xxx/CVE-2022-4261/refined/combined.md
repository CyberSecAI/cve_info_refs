[InsightVM Recent Releases /](/release-notes/insightvm/) Dec 07, 2022

Dec 07, 20226.6.172
## New

* **Recurring Coverage.** Google Chrome recurring vulnerability coverage now includes CVE-2022-4262.

## Improved

* **Office Click-to-Run vulnerability.** We have updated the check logic for Office Click-to-Run vulnerability checks, adding low bounds to reduce false positives.

## Fixed

* The First Found date shown in Vulnerability tables now appears correctly.
* The Incomplete Assets export to CSV no longer results in an empty CSV for a completed scan. The CSV file now populates with the incomplete asset data shown in the table.
* AWS instance ID collection no longer fails if Internet Explorer is not installed on Windows instances.
* Update packages are now correctly verified with update authenticity verification (CVE-2022-4261). To read more about this issue see our blog post [here](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/12/7/cve-2022-4261-rapid7-nexpose-update-validation-issue-fixed).

# Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Policy

[Report a vulnerability](https://rapid7.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new?ticket_form=vulnerability_disclosure)

**Rapid7âs Vulnerability Research and Disclosure Principles**

* **We believe in strengthening defense by democratizing access to attacker tooling and knowledge.** One of Rapid7âs unique strengths is our deep knowledge of how attackers work. Our vulnerability research and Metasploit teams strive to make attacker capabilities that would otherwise be used primarily by criminals accessible to all â enabling defenders to understand and prioritize critical vulnerabilities, develop detections and mitigations, and test security controls. Releasing public exploit code and novel research is core to our mission to close the security achievement gap.
* **Public disclosure of vulnerabilities is a critical component of a healthy cybersecurity ecosystem.** Rapid7 practices and advocates for timely public disclosure of vulnerabilities across both third-party products and our own systems and solutions. This includes vulnerabilities we independently discover in our customersâ tech stacks. Through transparent, open, and timely vulnerability disclosures, Rapid7 helps the entire internet protect and defend those assets and services critical to modern civilization.
* **In todayâs threat landscape, organizations need timely information about risk in order to make educated choices about protecting their networks â especially during active attacks.** Our coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy includes explicit provisions for speeding up public disclosure in cases where exploitation has been observed in the wild. Vendors often (understandably) act to protect their own businesses and reputations when there are security issues in their products that introduce risk into their downstream customersâ environments. When we know about exploitation in the wild, or when we believe that threat actors may be covertly weaponizing non-public vulnerabilities, our priority is to make customers and the community aware of that risk so they may take action to protect their organizations.

**Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Policy**

In keeping with standard industry practices around Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) (such as [CERT/CC's](https://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm), [Google's](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/01/policy-and-disclosure-2020-edition.html), [ZDI's](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/)), as well as the standards promulgated in [ISO 29147](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) and [ISO 30111](https://www.iso.org/standard/69725.html), Rapid7 will typically prepare and publish advisories detailing newly discovered vulnerabilities approximately 60 days after our initial attempts at private disclosure, barring extenuating circumstances (including those outlined below which may warrant different disclosure guidelines). These advisories will be made publicly available via Rapid7âs [blog](/blog/tag/vulnerability-disclosure/) and social media. Depending on the details of the findings, there may also be media engagement.

While coordinated vulnerability disclosure can differ from bug to bug depending on a wide range of circumstances, Rapid7's primary concern is getting vulnerabilities fixed and making affected parties aware of the risks associated with vulnerabilities. In keeping with the principles outlined above, Rapid7 has identified several common types of vulnerabilities, each of which warrants slightly different disclosure guidelines.

Please note, technical vulnerabilities often involve [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) and unexpected interactions. Therefore, Rapid7 may modify the timeline for disclosure at our sole discretion due to unique or unpredictable elements of that specific vulnerability.

**All Vulnerabilities (The Default Policy)**

* Rapid7 will confidentially disclose discovered vulnerabilities to the organization that is in the best position to address that vulnerability with a resolution. That organization is the "responsible organization."

+ If the responsible organization is not a [CVE Partner](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners), Rapid7 will reserve a CVE ID.

* After 15 days, Rapid7 will inform CERT/CC of the vulnerability with enough technical detail to demonstrate the issue. If the responsible organization has not acknowledged our initial disclosure by this time, Rapid7 will presume they are a "non-responsive responsible organization."
* After 60 days of confidential disclosure to the responsible organization, Rapid7 will publicly disclose vulnerability information, including CVE descriptions, opinions on risk, impact, and mitigation strategies, and enough technical detail to demonstrate the issue (collectively, "vulnerability details"). Rapid7 may involve media outlets in that disclosure.

+ During this 60 day window, Rapid7 expects the responsible organization will develop a resolution and make any update available for affected parties, and Rapid7 will keep CERT/CC apprised of the status of those updates.
+ If the responsible organization is showing consistent good-faith effort to develop and ship an update, but cannot complete this work within 60 days, a 30-day extension may be granted at Rapid7âs sole discretion under the Default Policy (or for any of the enumerated exceptions below).

* If Rapid7 becomes aware that an update was made generally available after reporting the issue to the responsible organization, including [silent patches](/blog/post/2022/06/06/the-hidden-harm-of-silent-patches/) which tend to hijack CVD norms, Rapid7 will aim to publish vulnerability details within 24 hours.
* Issues that are confidentially rediscovered and reported to the responsible organization as duplicates have no bearing on the timeline expectations of this policy.

**Exploited In the Wild***This is the case where we see active exploitation in a production environment, including our own. The goal in these situations is to release critical information about risk as quickly as possible so organizations may take informed action to protect themselves.*

This policy is identical to the default policy but for these changes:

* Rapid7 will aim to notify CERT/CC and publish public vulnerability information approximately 72 hours after discovery, regardless of the existence of an update.
* If the vulnerability was found within an organizationâs environment, Rapid7 will strive to notify directly affected organizations of the disclosure first.

**Patch Bypasses***This is the case where a vendor believes they fixed an issue, but didn't.*

This policy is identical to the Exploited In the Wild policy but for these changes:

* A new CVE ID will be reserved that references the original CVE ID.
* Rapid7 will inform the responsible organization and CERT/CC concurrently.
* Depending on the nature of the bypass, Rapid7 may release vulnerability details immediately, or up to 45 days after reporting to CERT/CC.

**Cloud/Hosted Vulnerabilities***This is the case where end users or implementors have nothing to fix on their end â fixing the issue requires only one responsible organization to act.*

This policy is identical to the default policy but for these changes:

* A CVE ID will not be reserved by Rapid7.
* If the issue is resolved inside the 60 day coordination window, Rapid7 will assess the value of a public disclosure. If the issue remains unresolved after the coordination window closes, a public disclosure may be issued per the default policy.

**Kinetic Vulnerabilities***These are vulnerabilities that have obvious and direct implications for human health and safety, and are not otherwise present in generally-used technology. Specialized OT and medical technology fall into this category.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will disclose vulnerability details 30 days after the general availability of the update, instead of immediately.

+ If the vulnerability becomes actively exploited in the wild, the Exploited in the Wild policy shall apply instead.

* Rapid7 will coordinate with relevant government agencies that are in a position to work with the responsible organization to develop, distribute and implement updates (including CERT/CC).
* Coordination with CERT/CC and the responsible organization may be extended for up to 180 days. If there is no update available after 180 days, Rapid7 will publish vulnerability details.

**Low-Impact Vulnerabilities***These vulnerabilities are trivial enough that an exploit would cause safely ignorable consequences to affected production environments, or limited to a single production instance, such as one website not connected to* [*critical infrastructure*](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors)*, or extant in only theoretical or very unlikely configurations of affected systems.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will not coordinate with CERT/CC.
* Rapid7 may not publish vulnerability details at any point, but may do so if circumstances change (for example, if it's shown that this low-impact vulnerability can be chained with another to achieve a high-impact result).

**Vulnerabilities with No Responsible Organization***These are vulnerabilities in obsolete systems, abandoned software packages, or maintained by non-responsive responsible organizations.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will publish vulnerability details 45 days after providing CERT/CC vulnerability details, or on a timeline that is agreed upon with CERT/CC.

**Multi-Faceted Vulnerabilities***These vulnerabilities match more than one non-default category, such as a vulnerability for unsupported software that is exploited in the wild.*

* If there is a conflict in timelines, the shorter timeline shall apply.

# CVE-2022-4261: Rapid7 Nexpose Update Validation Issue (FIXED)

* Dec 07, 2022
* 3 min read
* [Tod Beardsley](/blog/author/tod-beardsley/)

*Last updated at Thu, 28 Dec 2023 16:02:50 GMT*

On November 14, 2022, Rapid7's product engineering team discovered that the mechanism in Nexpose and InsightVM used to validate the source of an update file was unreliable. This failure, which involved the internal cryptographic validation of received updates, was designated as CVE-2022-4261, and is an instance of [CWE-494](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html). Rapid7's estimate of the CVSSv3.1 base rating for this vulnerability for most environments is [4.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1) (Medium). This issue has been resolved in the regular December 7, 2022 [release](https://docs.rapid7.com/release-notes/nexpose/20221207/).

## Product Description

Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM are vulnerability management systems, used by many enterprises around the world to assess and manage vulnerability exposures present in their networks. You can read more about Nexpose at [our website](https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/).

## Credit

This issue was discovered by Rapid7 Principal Software Engineer Emmett Kelly and validated by the Rapid7 Nexpose product team. It is being disclosed in accordance with [Rapid7's vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.rapid7.com/security/disclosure/).

## Exploitation

Exploitation of this issue is complex. In order to exploit CVE-2022-4261, an attacker would first need to be in a position to provide a malicious update to Nexpose or InsightVM, either through a privileged position on the network, on the local computer that runs Nexpose or InsightVM (with sufficient privileges to initiate an update), or by convincing a Nexpose administrator to apply a maliciously-crafted update through social engineering. Once applied, the update could introduce new functionality to Nexpose that would benefit the attacker.

Because of the complexity involved, we believe that our customers are better suited to make appropriate judgements on the risk of delaying this update, perhaps in accordance with established change control procedures.

## Impact

Given the requirement of a privileged position on the network or local machine, exploiting CVE-2022-4261, in most circumstances, is academic. Such an adversary is likely to already have many other (and often easier) choices when it comes to leveraging this position to cause trouble on the target network. In the case of a local machine compromise (which is the most likely attack scenario), the attacker could use this position to instead create a fairly permanent ingress avenue to the internal network and exercise the usual lateral movement options documented as ATT&CK technique [T1557](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/).

## Remediation

Most Nexpose and InsightVM administrators employ automated updates, and should apply updates either on their already established automated schedules or as soon as it's convenient to do so.

However, administrators that are especially concerned that they could be targeted during their next update, or who believe they have already been compromised by persistent attackers, should disable automatic updates and use the documented [Managing Updates without an Internet Connection](https://docs.rapid7.com/nexpose/managing-versions-updates-and-licenses/#managing-updates-without-an-internet-connection) procedure to fix this issue, after manually validating the authenticity of the update package. Disabling automatic updates completely removes the risk of exploitation of CVE-2022-4261.

Fixing an update system with an update is always fairly complex, given the [chicken-and-egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) nature of the problem being addressed, as well as the risks involved in using an update system to fix an update system. So, it is out of an abundance of caution that we are publishing this advisory today to ensure that customers who rely on automatic updates are made plainly aware of this issue and can plan accordingly.

*Update: On February 1st, Rapid7 released version 6.6.178 to address a secondary issue involving certificate validation with Nexpose and InsightVM, tracked as issue CVE-2022-3913.*

| [T1557.004](/techniques/T1557/004/) | [Evil Twin](/techniques/T1557/004/) |

Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](/techniques/T1040), [Transmitted Data Manipulation](/techniques/T1565/002), or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](/techniques/T1212)). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.[[1]](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/man-in-the-middle-attacks/)

For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.[[2]](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ttint-an-iot-remote-control-trojan-spread-through-2-0-day-vulnerabilities/)[[3]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/125/how-dns-changer-trojans-direct-users-to-threats)[[4]](https://securelist.com/ad-blocker-with-miner-included/101105/) Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials, including access tokens ([Steal Application Access Token](/techniques/T1528)) and session cookies ([Steal Web Session Cookie](/techniques/T1539)).[[5]](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/15/driftingcloud-zero-day-sophos-firewall-exploitation-and-an-insidious-breach/)[[6]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/16/token-tactics-how-to-prevent-detect-and-respond-to-cloud-token-theft/) [Downgrade Attack](/techniques/T1562/010)s can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.[[7]](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/man-in-the-middle-tls-ssl-protocol-downgrade-attack/)[[8]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05681)[[9]](https://tlseminar.github.io/downgrade-attacks/)

Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in [Transmitted Data Manipulation](/techniques/T1565/002). Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to [Impair Defenses](/techniques/T1562) and/or in support of a [Network Denial of Service](/techniques/T1498).

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [S0281](/software/S0281) | [Dok](/software/S0281) | [Dok](/software/S0281) proxies web traffic to potentially monitor and alter victim HTTP(S) traffic.[[10]](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x25.html)[[11]](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/04/27/osx-malware-catching-wants-read-https-traffic/) |
| [G0094](/groups/G0094) | [Kimsuky](/groups/G0094) | [Kimsuky](/groups/G0094) has used modified versions of PHProxy to examine web traffic between the victim and the accessed website.[[12]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-301a) |
| [S1131](/software/S1131) | [NPPSPY](/software/S1131) | [NPPSPY](/software/S1131) opens a new network listener for the `mpnotify.exe` process that is typically contacted by the Winlogon process in Windows. A new, alternative RPC channel is set up with a malicious DLL recording plaintext credentials entered into Winlogon, effectively intercepting and redirecting the logon information.[[13]](https://www.huntress.com/blog/cleartext-shenanigans-gifting-user-passwords-to-adversaries-with-nppspy) |

## Mitigations

| ID | Mitigation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [M1042](/mitigations/M1042) | [Disable or Remove Feature or Program](/mitigations/M1042) | Disable legacy network protocols that may be used to intercept network traffic if applicable, especially those that are not needed within an environment. |
| [M1041](/mitigations/M1041) | [Encrypt Sensitive Information](/mitigations/M1041) | Ensure that all wired and/or wireless traffic is encrypted appropriately. Use best practices for authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, and ensure web traffic that may contain credentials is protected by SSL/TLS. |
| [M1037](/mitigations/M1037) | [Filter Network Traffic](/mitigations/M1037) | Use network appliances and host-based security software to block network traffic that is not necessary within the environment, such as legacy protocols that may be leveraged for AiTM conditions. |
| [M1035](/mitigations/M1035) | [Limit Access to Resource Over Network](/mitigations/M1035) | Limit access to network infrastructure and resources that can be used to reshape traffic or otherwise produce AiTM conditions. |

Illustration of a woman collecting hens' eggs from *[Tacuina sanitatis](/wiki/Tacuinum_Sanitatis "Tacuinum Sanitatis")*, 14th century

The **chicken or the egg** [causality](/wiki/Causality "Causality") [dilemma](/wiki/Dilemma "Dilemma") is commonly stated as the question, "which came first: the [chicken](/wiki/Chicken "Chicken") or the [egg](/wiki/Egg_%28biology%29 "Egg (biology)")?" The dilemma stems from the observation that all chickens hatch from eggs and all chicken eggs are laid by chickens. "Chicken-and-egg" is a metaphoric adjective describing situations where it is not clear which of two events should be considered the *cause* and which should be considered the *effect*, to express a scenario of [infinite regress](/wiki/Infinite_regress "Infinite regress"), or to express the difficulty of sequencing actions where each seems to depend on others being done first. [Plutarch](/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch") posed the question as a philosophical matter in his essay "[The Symposiacs](/wiki/Moralia "Moralia")", written in the 1st century CE.[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-O'Brien-2)

## Ancient legacy

The question represents an ancient folk paradox addressing the problem of origins and [first cause](/wiki/First_cause "First cause").[[3]](#cite_note-paradox-3) [Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), writing in the fourth century BCE, concluded that this was an infinite sequence, with no true origin.[[3]](#cite_note-paradox-3) Plutarch, writing four centuries later, specifically highlighted this question as bearing on a "great and weighty problem (whether the world had a beginning)".[[4]](#cite_note-Fabry-4) In the fifth century CE, [Macrobius](/wiki/Macrobius "Macrobius") wrote that while the question seemed trivial, it "should be regarded as one of importance".[[4]](#cite_note-Fabry-4)

By the end of the 16th century, the well-known question seemed to have been regarded as settled in the Christian world, based on the origin story of the [Bible](/wiki/Bible "Bible"). In describing the creation of animals, it allows for a first chicken that did not come from an egg. However, later [Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") philosophers began to question this solution.[[4]](#cite_note-Fabry-4) [Carlo Dati](/wiki/Carlo_Roberto_Dati "Carlo Roberto Dati") in the mid 17th-century published an erudite satire on the subject.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

## Scientific resolutions

Although the question is typically used metaphorically, [evolutionary biology](/wiki/Evolutionary_biology "Evolutionary biology") provides literal answers, made possible by the Darwinian principle that species [evolve](/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") over time, and thus that chickens had ancestors that were not chickens,[[4]](#cite_note-Fabry-4) similar to a view expressed by the Greek philosopher [Anaximander](/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") when addressing the paradox.[[3]](#cite_note-paradox-3)

If the question refers to eggs in general, the egg came first. The first [amniote](/wiki/Amniote "Amniote") egg â that is, a hard-shelled egg that could be laid on land, rather than remaining in water like the eggs of fish or amphibians â appeared around 312 million years ago.[[6]](#cite_note-6) In contrast, chickens are domesticated descendants of [red junglefowl](/wiki/Red_junglefowl "Red junglefowl") and probably arose little more than eight thousand years ago, at most.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

If the question refers to *chicken* eggs specifically, the answer is still the egg, but the explanation is more complicated.[[8]](#cite_note-SOR-8) The process by which the chicken arose through the interbreeding and domestication of multiple species of wild jungle fowl is poorly understood, and the point at which this evolving organism became a chicken is a somewhat arbitrary distinction. Whatever criteria one chooses, an animal nearly identical to the modern chicken (i.e., a [proto](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proto- "wiktionary:proto-")-chicken) laid a fertilized egg that had DNA making it a modern chicken due to mutations in the mother's ovum, the father's sperm, or the fertilised [zygote](/wiki/Zygote "Zygote").[[9]](#cite_note-9)[[4]](#cite_note-Fabry-4)[[10]](#cite_note-Zushi-10)[[11]](#cite_note-NBCnews.com-11)

It has been suggested that the actions of a [protein](/wiki/Protein "Protein") found in modern chicken eggs may make the answer different.[[10]](#cite_note-Zushi-10)[[11]](#cite_note-NBCnews.com-11) In the uterus, chickens produce ovocleidin-17 (OC-17), which causes the formation of the thickened [calcium carbonate](/wiki/Calcium_carbonate "Calcium carbonate") shell around their eggs. Because OC-17 is expressed by the hen and not the egg, the bird in which the protein first arose, though having hatched from a non-reinforced egg, would then have laid the first egg having such a reinforced shell: the chicken would have preceded this first 'modern' chicken egg.[[10]](#cite_note-Zushi-10)[[11]](#cite_note-NBCnews.com-11) However, the presence of OC-17 or a homolog in other species, such as turkeys[[12]](#cite_note-12) and finches[[13]](#cite_note-13) suggests that such eggshell-reinforcing proteins are common to all birds,[[14]](#cite_note-14) and thus long predate the first chickens.

## Disputations

In Indonesia, on 24 July 2024, two men were at a drinking party when they entered into a chicken-or-egg debate. One man became so emotionally enraged, he left and returned with a knife, stabbing the other 15 times, killing him. It's uncertain which side â chicken or egg â the killer took.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16)[[17]](#cite_note-17)

# Managing versions, updates, and licenses

### New port for Nexpose product updates

A server update has been implemented to utilize SSL for communication encryption and to better handle client connection with modern libraries. You must allow your server hosting Nexpose to make **outbound** connections to **updates.rapid7.com** on **port 443** in order to receive future Nexpose product and content updates.

This section addresses how to keep the application updated.

## Viewing version and update information

It is important to keep track of updates and to know which version of the application you are running. For example, a new vulnerability check may require the latest product update in order to work. If you are not seeing expected results for that check, you may want to verify that the application has installed the latest product update. Also, if you contact Technical Support with an issue, the support engineer may ask you which version and update of the application you are running.

1. Click the **Administration** tab of the Security Console interface.
2. In Console > Licensing section, click **View** current license.

   The **General** page of the Security Console Configuration panel will display.
   On this page you can view the current version of the application. You can also view the dates and update IDs for the current product and content updates. Release announcements always include update IDs, so you can match the IDs displayed on the Security Console page with those in the announcement to verify that you are running the latest updates.

![](/api/docs/file/product-documentation__master/nexpose/images/s_security_console_general_nexpose.jpg)
## Viewing, activating, renewing, or changing your license

On the **Licensing** page, you can see license-related information about your Security Console. You also can activate a new license or start the process to modify or renew your license. Your Security Console must be connected to the Internet to activate your license.

If your Security Console is not connected to the Internet, see [Managing updates without an Internet connection](/nexpose/managing-versions-updates-and-licenses#managing-updates-without-an-internet-connection).

The **License Activation** area displays general information about your license.

* If your license is **active**, you will see a link for contacting Rapid7 to modify your license, which is optional.
* If your license is **expired**, you will see a link for contacting Rapid7 to renew your license. You will need an active license in order to run scans and create reports.

![](/api/docs/file/product-documentation__master/nexpose/images/s_nx_activate_1st_step.jpg)
#### Activating your license with a license key

If your Security Console has Internet access, you can activate your license with a license key. Provided to you by the Account Management team, the key is a string of 16 numbers and letters separated into four groups by hyphens.

1. On the **Licensing** page, click **Activate a New License**.
   The Security Console displays a text box.
2. Enter the key in the text box.
   You can copy the key from the e-mail that was sent to you from the Account Management team.
3. Click **Activate with key**.
   The Security Console displays a success message.
   You do not have to click **Save**. The application does not have to restart.

![](/api/docs/file/product-documentation__master/nexpose/images/s_nx_activate_key.jpg)
#### Activating your license with a license file

If your Security Console does not have access to the Internet or to the updates.rapid7.com server, you can activate your license with a license file. Provided to you by the Account Management team, this file has a **.lic** extension and lists all the features and scanning capacities that are available with your license.

To activate with a license file:

1. After you receive the license file from the Account Management team, download it.
2. Using the computer that you downloaded the file on, log onto the Security Console.
3. Click the **Administration** tab.
4. In the **Console > Licensing** section, click Console > Licensing > Activate a license a license.
   The Security Console displays the **Security Console Configuration** panel.
5. Click **Licensing** in the left navigation pane.
   The Security Console displays the **Licensing** page.
6. Click **Activate a New License**.
7. Click the link labeled **Use a license file**. A button appears for choosing a file.
8. Click the **Choose file** button.
9. Find the downloaded **.lic** file in your file system and select it. The file name appears on the **Licensing** page.
10. Click the **Activate with file** button. The Security Console displays a success message.
11. Click the **OK** button.

The **Licensing** page refreshes and displays the updated license information in the **License Details** area.
You do not have to click **Save**, and the Security Console does not have to restart.

![](/api/docs/file/product-documentation__master/nexpose/images/s_nx_activate_file.jpg)
#### Viewing license details

In the **License Details** area of the **Licensing** page, you can see more information about your license:

* The value for **License Status** is one of four different modes, depending on the status of your license.
* The value for **Expiration** is the date that your current license expires.
* The value for **Max. Scan Engines** is the total number of internal Scan Engines that you can use. These Scan Engines can be installed on any host computers on your network.
* The value for **Max. Assets to Scan** is the total number of assets that you can scan with your internal Scan Engines.
* The value for **Max. Assets to Scan w/ Hosted Engine** is the total number of assets that you can scan with a Hosted Scan Engine.
* If the value for **SCADA Scanning** is Enabled, you can scan assets with the SCADA scan template. For a description of this template, see [Where to find SCAP update information and OVAL files](/nexpose/scap-compliance#where-to-find-scap-update-information-and-oval-files).
* If the value for **Discovery Scanning is Enabled**, you can run discovery scans to determine what assets are available on your network without performing vulnerability checks on those assets.
* If the value for **PCI Reporting is Enabled**, you can create reports using the PCI Executive Overview and PCI Audit report templates. If this feature is disabled, it will still appear to be available in your scan template, but it will not be active during scans.
* If the value for **Web Application Scanning is Enabled**, you can scan Web applications with the spider. If this feature is disabled, it will still appear to be available in your scan template, but it will not be active during scans.
* If the value for **Policy Scanning is Enabled**, you can scan assets to verify compliance with configuration policies. If this feature is disabled, it will still appear to be available in your scan template, but it will not be active during scans.

## Managing updates with an Internet connection

By default, the Security Console automatically downloads and applies two types of updates.

### Content updates

Content updates include new checks for vulnerabilities, patch verification, and security policy compliance. Content updates always occur automatically when they are available. However, it is possible to disable automatic content updates in the **Security Console Configuration** and schedule them at a time of your choosing.

### Product updates

Product updates include performance improvements, bug fixes, and new product features. It is possible to disable automatic product updates in the **Security Console Configuration** and update the product manually.

When you apply a product update, the latest available content updates up to the current date will also be applied.

![](/api/docs/file/product-documentation__master/nexpose/images/s_nx_updates.jpg)
### Disabling automatic product updates

You can disable automatic product updates and initiate one-time product updates on an as-needed basis. This gives your organization the time and flexibility to train staff or otherwise prepare for updates that might cause changes in workflow. For example, a new feature may streamline a particular workflow by eliminating certain steps.

Some new vulnerability and policy checks, which are included in content updates, require concurrent product updates in order to work properly.

To disable automatic product updates:

1. Click the **Administration** tab.
2. In the **Console > Info** section, click **View** general information and updates.
3. Select **Updates** from the menu on the left-hand side.
4. Clear the checkbox labeled **Enable automatic product updates**.
   A warning dialog box appears about the risks of disabling automatic product updates.
   Click **Disable automatic product updates** to confirm that you want to turn off this feature.
   Or click **Cancel** to leave automatic product updates enabled.
5. Click **Save**.
   Whenever you change this setting and click **Save**, the application downloads any available product updates. If you have disabled the setting, it does not apply any downloaded product updates.

### Enabling automatic product updates

Your PostgreSQL database must be version 9. Otherwise, the application will not apply product updates. If you are using an earlier version of PostgreSQL, see [Migrating the database](/nexpose/managing-the-security-console#migrating-the-database).

Enabling automatic product updates ensures that you are always running the most current version of the application.

To enable automatic product updates after they have been previously disabled:

1. Go to the **Administration** tab.
2. In the **Console > Info** section, click **View** general information and updates.
3. Select **Updates** from the left navigation pane.
4. Select the **Enable automatic product updates** check box.
5. Click **Save**.
   Whenever you change this setting and click **Save**, the application downloads any available product updates. If you have enabled the setting, it also applies any downloaded product updates and restarts.

### Manual product updates

When automatic product updates have been disabled, you can manually download product updates.

By using this one-time update feature, you are not enabling future automatic product updates if they are not currently enabled.

To manually download a new product update:

1. Go to the **Administration** page.
2. In the **Console > Info** section, click **View** general information and updates.

This option only appears if you have already disabled automatic product updates as described in [Disabling automatic product updates](managing-versions-updates-and-licenses#disabling-automatic-product-updates).

The list of current and available updates appears.

3. Select **Updates** from the left navigation pane.
   The Releases page appears.
4. To update to the most recent product release, click **Update to Latest Version**.
5. If you have not updated for a while, there may have been multiple versions released since your last update. In this case, you can select a version to which to update. To select a previous version to update to, navigate to that version and click **Update**. Releases up to and including that version will be applied.
6. On the Confirm Update dialog, click **Update**.
   or (Optional) Click **Cancel** if you do not want to perform the update.

![](/api/docs/file/product-documentation__master/nexpose/images/s_nx_select_update_version.jpg)
### Scheduling automatic updates

By default, the Security Console queries the update server for updates every six hours. If an update is available, the console downloads and applies the update and then restarts. You can schedule updates to recur at specific times that are convenient for your business operations. For example, you may want updates to only occur during non-business hours or at times when they won't coincide with and disrupt scans.

Content updates are always applied according to the schedule, and product updates are applied according to the schedule only if they are enabled.

To schedule updates:

1. Go to the **Administration** page.
2. In the **Console > Info** section, click **View** general information and updates.
3. Select **Updates** from the left navigation pane.
   The **Updates** page appears.
4. If you want to prevent the Security Console from applying any available updates whenever it starts up, clear the appropriate checkbox. Disabling this default setting allows you to resume normal operations after an unscheduled restart instead of delaying these operations until any updates are applied.
5. Select a date and time to start your update schedule.
6. Select how frequently you want the Security Console to apply any available updates once the schedule is in effect.
7. Click **Save**.

## Configuring proxy settings for updates

If the Security Console does not have direct Internet access, you can use a proxy server for downloading updates. In most cases, Technical Support will advise if you need to change this setting. This topic covers configuring proxy settings for updates. You can also learn how about [Using a proxy server for sending logs](/nexpose/troubleshooting#using-a-proxy-server-for-sending-logs).

For information on configuring updates for an Appliance, see the **Appliance Guide** which you can download from the **Support** page of **Help**.

To configure proxy settings for updates:

1. Click the **Administration** tab.
   The **Administration** page appears.
2. In the **Console > Info** section, click **View** general information and updates.
3. Go to the **Proxy Settings** page.
4. Enter the information for the proxy server in the appropriate fields:
   * The **Name or address** field is set to **updates.rapid7.com** by default, which means that the Security Console is configured to contact the update server directly. If you want to use a proxy, enter the name or IP address of the proxy server.
   * The **Port** field is set to **443** by default because the Security Console contacts the update server on that port. If you want to use a proxy, and if it uses a different port number for communication with the Security Console, enter that port number.
   * The **Response timeout** field sets the interval that the Security Console will wait to receive a requested package before initiating a timeout of the transfer. The default setting is 30,000 ms, or 30 seconds. The minimum setting is 1,000 ms, and the maximum is 2,147,483,647 ms. A proxy server may not relay an entire requested package to the Security Console until it downloads and analyzes the package in its entirety. Larger packages require more time. To determine how long to allow for a response interval, see the following topic: \_Determining a response timeout interval for the proxy.
   * The Security Console uses the information in the **Domain**, **User name**, and **Password** fields to be authenticated on a proxy server. If you want to use a proxy server, enter required values for those fields.

After you enter the information, click **Save**.

#### Determining a response timeout interval for the proxy

To determine a timeout interval for the proxy server, find out how much time the Security Console requires to download a certain number of megabytes. You can, for example, locate the downloaded .JAR archive for a recent update and learn from the log file how long it took for the Security Console to download a file of that size.

Open the nsc.log file, located in the [installation\_directory]/nsc directory. Look for a sequence of lines that reference the download of an update, such as the following:

```
 12013-06-05T00:04:10 [INFO] [Thread: Security Console] Downloading update ID 1602503.22013-06-05T00:04:12 [INFO] [Thread: Security Console] Response via 1.1 proxy.example.com.32013-06-05T00:05:05 [INFO] [Thread: Security Console] Response via 1.1 proxy.example.com.42013-06-05T00:05:07 [INFO] [Thread: Security Console] Acknowledging receipt of update ID 1602503.
```

Note the time elapsed between the first entry (`Downloading update ID...`) and the last entry (`Acknowledging receipt of update...`).

Then go to the directory on the Security Console host where the .JAR archives for updates are stored: [installation\_directory]/updates/packages. Locate the file with the update ID referenced in the log entries and note its size. Using the time required for the download and the size of the file, you can estimate the timeout interval required for downloading future updates. It is helpful to use a larger update file for the estimate.

In most cases, a timeout interval of 5 minutes (300,000 ms) is generally sufficient for most update file sizes.

## Managing updates without an Internet connection

If your network environment is isolated from the Internet, you can apply an update by running the installer that is released with that update. When you start the installer, it automatically scans your current installation for files to repair or update and then applies those changes.

An "update" installation leaves your database and configuration settings intact. The only changes it makes to your deployment are the updates.

You will require one computer to have Internet access, so that you can download the installer.

The first step is downloading the latest installer that is appropriate for your operating system.

Hyperlinks for downloading installers are available in the [Knowledge Base](https://kb.help.rapid7.com/docs/insightvm-and-nexpose-installers-md5sum-files-and-virtual-appliances).

You can also use the following hyperlinks:

* [Linux 64 installer](https://download2.rapid7.com/download/NeXpose-v4/NeXposeSetup-Linux64.bin)
* [Windows 64 installer](https://download2.rapid7.com/download/NeXpose-v4/NeXposeSetup-Windows64.exe)

After you download the appropriate installer, take the following steps:

1. If the service is running, stop it to allow the installer to apply updates or repairs.
2. Run the installer. For detailed directions, see the installation guide, which you can download from the **Support** page in Help.
