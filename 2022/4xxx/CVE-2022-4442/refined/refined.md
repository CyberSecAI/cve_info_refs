  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Allows high-privilege users to perform Stored XSS attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "By creating/editing a Post Type or taxonomy via the plugin's admin interface and injecting malicious JavaScript code in the 'Singular Label' and 'Plural Label' fields.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have high-privileges such as an admin role within the WordPress installation. The 'unfiltered_html' capability is not required for exploitation."
