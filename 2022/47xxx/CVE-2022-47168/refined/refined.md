- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user, such as a subscriber, can execute higher privileged actions, which could lead to various impacts depending on the specific function exposed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not specified but can be assumed to be via a web request to the vulnerable function within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber user.
