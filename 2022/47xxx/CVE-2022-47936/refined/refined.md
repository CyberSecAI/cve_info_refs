Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-47936:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a stack overflow when parsing specially crafted JT files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
*   The application could potentially crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.
*   The user must be tricked into opening a malicious JT file (UI:R - User interaction required).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious JT file to the target system, and trick a user into opening the file using a vulnerable application.
*   No privileges are needed (PR:N).

**Affected Products:**
*   JT Open Toolkit: All versions < V11.2.3.0
*   JT Utilities: All versions < V13.2.3.0
*   Parasolid V34.0: All versions < V34.0.252
*   Parasolid V34.1: All versions < V34.1.242
*   Parasolid V35.0: All versions < V35.0.170
*  Parasolid V35.1: All versions < V35.1.150

**Additional Notes:**

* The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is triggered while parsing JT files.
* The provided CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C`.
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Siemens products using JT file parsing.
*   Siemens has released updates to address the vulnerability.
*   A workaround is to avoid opening untrusted files.
