  "CVE-2022-47130": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to induce unintended actions from a user.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
          "Lack of unpredictable request parameters",
          "Cookie-based session handling without proper CSRF protection"
        ],
         "impact": "A successful CSRF attack can cause the victim user to unintentionally perform actions such as changing their email address, password, or making funds transfers, potentially leading to full control of the user's account and/or application data and functionality.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Attacker crafts a malicious web page that triggers a request to the vulnerable website.",
          "Victim user visits the malicious web page while logged into the vulnerable website.",
          "The victim's browser automatically includes their session cookie in the request, allowing the malicious request to be processed by the vulnerable application as if it came from the victim."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host a web page that can be visited by a victim who is logged into the vulnerable application. Also, the attacker needs to be able to know or guess all of the request parameters necessary to exploit the target functionality.",
        "additional_details": "The provided content describes what CSRF is, how it works, and how to exploit it, with example attack vectors, and also includes information on common defenses and how to bypass them. It emphasizes that the application relies on cookie-based sessions and lacks mechanisms to validate the userâ€™s intent. The content also describes how a CSRF PoC (Proof of Concept) can be generated using Burp Suite."
