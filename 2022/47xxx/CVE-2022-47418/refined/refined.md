Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-47418:

**CVE-2022-47418:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Product:** LogicalDOC CE/Enterprise
*   **Affected Versions:** 8.7.3/8.8.2
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in document version comments.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79)
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker with access to the LogicalDOC system uploads a document.
    2.  The attacker adds a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src/onerror=alert('XSS-version-comment')>`) in the "Version comment" field when saving the document.
    3.  When any user selects the document and views the Versions or History tab, the XSS payload executes in the user's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   An attacker needs to have access to the LogicalDOC system.  "Guest" access might be sufficient.
    *   Ability to upload document and add/edit version comments.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This allows for actions like:
        *   Stealing session cookies to impersonate a logged-in user (e.g., an administrator).
        *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
        *   Gaining access to sensitive documents.
        *   Hooking the victim's browser session and injecting the attacker's commands.
*   **Additional Notes:**
    * The vulnerability can be triggered by any user who views the Versions or History tab of a document with a malicious version comment.
    * The vendor has not released a patch at the time of the report.
