- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will cause the user to perform unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a higher-privileged, authenticated user into executing the malicious request. The attacker does not require any specific authentication to initiate the attack; however, a logged-in privileged user must interact with the forged request.
