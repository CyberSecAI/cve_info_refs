{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2022-47925",
    "root_cause": "The `validate` JSON endpoint of the `csaf-validator-service` processes tests with unexpected names. It does not properly validate the input, allowing function names that are inherited by all JavaScript objects (e.g., `constructor`, `toString`, `isPrototypeOf`) to be executed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)"
    ],
     "impact": "Insufficient validation of input might lead to unexpected behavior in the application. However, there is currently no known exploit that would impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "No privileges are required. An attacker can send requests to the `validate` endpoint.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in versions of `csaf-validator-service` prior to 1.0.1. There was also a versioning confusion where the initial documentation and API release mentioned version 1.0.0, but the actual release was 0.1.0. Later releases were correctly labeled. This version confusion could lead to users believing they are patched when they are not. The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.1, and the version confusion was also resolved. Versions with 1.0.0 in the `package.json` are not vulnerable. The vulnerability has a medium severity."
