- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the CmpApp component of the CODESYS Control runtime system when processing specific crafted communication requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow. The vulnerability allows writing attacker-controlled data to the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition, memory overwriting, or remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network based and requires sending crafted communication requests via the CODESYS protocol to the affected service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the CODESYS service.
