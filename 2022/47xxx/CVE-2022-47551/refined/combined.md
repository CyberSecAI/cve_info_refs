# Potential permissions bypass in Apiman 1.5.7 through Apiman 2.2.3.Final (CVE-2022-47551)

A vulnerability in Apiman has been disclosed that you need to be aware of and respond to.
It has CVE ID [CVE-2022-47551](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-47551).

## Details

Incorrect default permissions for certain read-only resources in the Apiman 1.5.7.Final through 2.2.3.Final in the Apiman Manager REST API allows a remote authenticated attacker to access information and resources in an Apiman Organizations they are not a member of and/or do not have permissions for.

For example, an attacker may be able to craft an HTTP request to discover APIs that are private to organizations they are not members of, via fuzzing, search, and other similar mechanisms.

If the attacker has sufficient permissions in their own organization, they may also be able to sign up to the private APIs they have discovered by crafting a tailored HTTP request, thereby gaining access to an API Management protected resource that they should have access to.

## Implications

* A malicious account-holder may be able to see information about APIs they do not have permission for.* A malicious account-holder may be able to sign up to APIs they do not have permission for.* This does **NOT** relate to the Apiman Gateway.

## Actions to take

Broadly, your options are as follows:

1. Upgrade to Apiman 3.0.0.Final (or later). The issue is fixed in this version.- If you are using an older version of Apiman, contact to your [Apiman support provider](/support.html) for advice/long-term support.

## How did this happen?

Some read permissions checks from the Apiman Manager REST API were removed as part of a large contribution that Apiman reviewers did not notice.

After making contact with the contributor, the intent of the change was to enable APIs published in an Apiman organization (analogous to a GitHub Organization) to be discovered by an external application — but Apiman did not offer a per-API implicit permissions system to achieve this until Apiman 3.0.0.Final, explicit membership of an organization was required.

The contributor removed certain permissions checks as a workaround for the lack of an implicit permissions system without recognising the security implications.

We have established additional processes to catch errors of this type in future.

# Apiman (Open Source API Management)

**⚡️⚡️ Apiman 4 is under active development ⚡️⚡️**

Apiman is a flexible and open source API Management platform.

With just a few clicks you can get Apiman running, putting a platform at your fingertips that covers the whole API Management lifecycle. Whether you want to offer existing APIs to external consumers in a secure way, or have a centralised location to discover and govern APIs, Apiman has you covered.

But that's not all. Apiman is designed to be easy to customise, and you can implement your own functionality by writing simple Java plugins.

## 🗞️ Apiman Newsletter

## 📖 Requirements

* Java 11+
* To build Apiman with tests: Docker or an equivalent container engine. This is for running tests with [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/).
* Naturally, if you're using an Apiman container, you'll need it for runtime too!

## 🏃‍♂️ Quickstart

You can look at the Apiman [quickstarts on apiman.io](https://www.apiman.io).

Or, you can build and run our 'server-all' quickstart to try everything out immediately.

Here's what you need to do:

```
echo "Cloning Apiman"
git clone https://github.com/apiman/apiman.git && cd apiman

echo "Building Apiman"
./fastbuild.sh

echo "Starting a Keycloak container with a demo Apiman realm"
cd tools/server-all/target/docker
docker compose up -d

echo "Starting Apiman WildFly Quickstart" && cd ../
./wildfly-dev-server/bin/standalone.sh
```

Once Apiman has started up, and if all went well, you can point your browser to the API Manager via <http://localhost:8080/apimanui/> and log in (either register a new user or log in as the admin):

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin123!`

You can log into the Keycloak admin console via <http://localhost:8085/admin> (same credentials as above).

This quickstart seeds a bunch of content into apiman. This is not strictly necessary, but it does populate the API Manager with some data so that it doesn't feel so lonely the first time you log in.

There's also a handy echo service available at <http://localhost:8080/services/echo> - it's useful for demos. You're welcome!

⚠️ Please don't use Apiman's default usernames, passwords, keys, certificates, etc., in production.

## ⚒️ Build Apiman

### Fast and easy

The easiest way to build quickly (without tests) is to run our [fastbuild script](https://github.com/apiman/apiman/blob/master/fastbuild.sh). It's in the root of the project. If you have [mvnd](https://github.com/apache/maven-mvnd/) the build will be faster.

```
git clone https://github.com/apiman/apiman.git && cd apiman
./fastbuild.sh
```

### I want to run the tests

First, build the parent pom (it's in `/parent`), then you can build the main project from the top level.

```
echo "Building Apiman Parent..."
cd parent
../mvnw clean install

cd ..
echo "Building the main Apiman project..."
./mvnw clean install
```
