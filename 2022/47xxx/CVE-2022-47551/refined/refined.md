Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-47551

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect default permissions for certain read-only resources in the Apiman Manager REST API.
- The vulnerability was introduced when some read permission checks were removed as part of a large contribution, without fully recognizing the security implications. This was done as a workaround for the lack of a per-API implicit permissions system, but it inadvertently exposed resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control checks on read-only resources in the Apiman Manager REST API. This allows unauthorized access to information about APIs.
- **Permissions Bypass:** An authenticated attacker can bypass intended permissions by accessing resources they shouldn't have access to, potentially revealing private APIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious authenticated user can discover information about APIs that are private to organizations they are not a member of. This includes discovering the existence of APIs through fuzzing, search, and similar mechanisms.
- **Unauthorized Access:** If the attacker has sufficient permissions in their own organization, they might be able to subscribe to discovered private APIs by crafting tailored HTTP requests, effectively gaining access to protected resources they shouldn't have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the Apiman Manager REST API.
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can craft specific HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability. This includes fuzzing, search and other similar techniques to discover private APIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Apiman Manager.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Apiman Manager REST API.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker would likely need some knowledge of how the API works to craft the malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Apiman Manager REST API and does *not* affect the Apiman Gateway.
- The issue is resolved in Apiman version 3.0.0.Final and later.
