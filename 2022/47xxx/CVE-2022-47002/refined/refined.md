Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a conditional logic flaw within the "remember me" functionality of Masa CMS. Specifically, the `rememberMe()` function in `/core/mura/login/loginManager.cfc` incorrectly validates the decrypted `userHash` cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is that the application allows a user to be logged in without proper authentication.
-   **Conditional Logic Flaw:** The `rememberMe` function checks if the decrypted `userHash` is either empty or matches the stored hash. An attacker can bypass the hash comparison by providing an empty or specially crafted `userHash` cookie that, after decryption, results in a zero-byte string.
-   **Insecure `decrypt()` Usage:** The application uses the `decrypt()` function without proper input validation on the `userHash` cookie, allowing an attacker to provide an empty string, or specific one-character strings that result in a zero-length decrypted value (in the case of ACF).
- **UUID Information Leakage**: The Mura JSON API leaks valid user UUIDs without authentication, which can be used to target specific users when exploiting the authentication bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Unauthenticated Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can log in as any user (Site Member or System User) within the CMS.
-   **Full Access to User Accounts:** With access to any user account, the attacker has the same privileges as that user.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `userid` and `userHash` cookies in an HTTP request.
-   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker sends a request containing a known `userid` along with an empty `userHash` cookie (or specific 1-character string if targeting ACF) .

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the target CMS.
-   **Knowledge of a valid `userid`:** The attacker requires valid `userid` UUID, which can be obtained via Mura's JSON API or other information leakage vulnerabilities.
-   **No prior authentication:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to perform the attack

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in both Mura CMS and Masa CMS due to code overlap between the two codebases
- The vulnerability can be exploited on both Lucee and Adobe ColdFusion, though the exploit payloads are different.
- A suggested "quick fix" is provided, modifying the conditional statement in the rememberMe function to explicitly require a non-empty userHash in addition to comparison.
- The blog post also highlights that user-controlled ciphertext should always include an HMAC or cryptographic integrity check.
- The CFMX_COMPAT algorithm is highlighted as insecure and should be replaced with more secure alternative
