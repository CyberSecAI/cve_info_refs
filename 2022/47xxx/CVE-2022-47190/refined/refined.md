        "root_cause": "The changelog for firmware version 2.12 of BACS, CS141, SITEMANAGER and SITEMONITOR mentions that it implements a fix that restricts uploads to specific file types and verifies the authenticity of the update package and files types within backup archives. These fixes address vulnerabilities that could potentially allow an attacker to upload malicious files or manipulate backups.",

          "Unrestricted file uploads",

           "Uploading files via the web interface",
           "Manipulating system backup files"
