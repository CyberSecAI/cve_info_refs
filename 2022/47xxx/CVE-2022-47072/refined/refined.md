The provided content relates to CVE-2022-47072.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user input in the "Find" field within the "Select Classifier" functionality of Enterprise Architect. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can retrieve sensitive information such as user credentials (usernames and passwords), database version information, and potentially other data stored in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Find" field within the "Select Classifier" functionality of the Enterprise Architect application.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the application's interface and navigate to the "Select Classifier" dialogue box.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Enterprise Architect application's interface.
- They need to be able to access the "Browse for Diagram" option and then use the search functionality within the "Select Classifier" window.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Enterprise Architect v.16.0.1605(Build: 1605) - 32 bit.
- The vendor fixed the vulnerability in build 1625 but misleadingly described the fix in the changelog as *"Select Dialog 'Search' tab now allows finding elements containing an apostrophe"*
- The vendor stored passwords in plaintext in older versions of EA, and from EA 11 onward, they're stored as SHA-256 hashes in t\_xref table, but the report speculates that plaintext passwords might still exist due to upgrades from older versions.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) includes two example payloads: one to extract usernames and passwords, and another to retrieve the database version.
