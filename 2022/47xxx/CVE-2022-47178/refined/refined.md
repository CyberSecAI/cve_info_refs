- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Simple Share Buttons Adder plugin (versions <= 8.5.2) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the application. This could lead to unauthorized changes or actions being performed on the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into performing actions via a crafted request. The attacker leverages the user's existing session to perform the actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application.
