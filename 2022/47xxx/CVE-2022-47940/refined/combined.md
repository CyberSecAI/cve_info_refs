Subject: Re: Details on this supposed Linux Kernel ksmbd RCE

Hi,

Mitre has assigned following CVEs, also torvalds mainline commits:

ZDI-22-1687 - CVE-2022-47941
	aa7253c2393f6dcd6a1468b0792f6da76edad917
ZDI-22-1688 - CVE-2022-47942
	8f0541186e9ad1b62accc9519cc2b7a7240272a7
ZDI-22-1689 - CVE-2022-47938
	824d4f64c20093275f72fc8101394d75ff6a249e
ZDI-22-1690 - CVE-2022-47939
	a54c509c32adba9d136f2b9d6a075e8cae1b6d27
ZDI-22-1691 - CVE-2022-47940
	158a66b245739e15858de42c0ba60fcf3de9b8e6

Mitre assigned also from the stable patch, but was not in ZDI set - CVE-2022-47943
	ac60778b87e45576d7bfdbd6f53df902654e6f09

	(I did not request that in my batch, Mitre seemed to have
	picked this from the stable patch.)

I mistakenly declared 5.13-5.19 affectedness to Mitre in a hurry,
but it is more 5.15 - 5.18.x / 5.19.x

Ciao, Marcus

    net: phy: smsc: Disable Energy Detect Power-Down in interrupt mode

    commit 2642cc6c3bbe0900ba15bab078fd15ad8baccbc5 upstream.

    Simon reports that if two LAN9514 USB adapters are directly connected
    without an intermediate switch, the link fails to come up and link LEDs
    remain dark.  The issue was introduced by commit 1ce8b37241ed ("usbnet:
    smsc95xx: Forward PHY interrupts to PHY driver to avoid polling").

    The PHY suffers from a known erratum wherein link detection becomes
    unreliable if Energy Detect Power-Down is used.  In poll mode, the
    driver works around the erratum by briefly disabling EDPD for 640 msec
    to detect a neighbor, then re-enabling it to save power.

    In interrupt mode, no interrupt is signaled if EDPD is used by both link
    partners, so it must not be enabled at all.

    We'll recoup the power savings by enabling SUSPEND1 mode on affected
    LAN95xx chips in a forthcoming commit.

    drm/bridge: tc358767: Fix (e)DP bridge endpoint parsing in dedicated function

    commit 9030a9e571b3ba250d3d450a98310e3c74ecaff4 upstream.

    Per toshiba,tc358767.yaml DT binding document, port@2 the output (e)DP
    port is optional. In case this port is not described in DT, the bridge
    driver operates in DPI-to-DP mode. The drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge()
    call in tc_probe_edp_bridge_endpoint() returns -ENODEV in case port@2
    is not present in DT and this specific return value is incorrectly
    propagated outside of tc_probe_edp_bridge_endpoint() function. All
    other error values must be propagated and are propagated correctly.

    Return 0 in case the port@2 is missing instead, that reinstates the
    original behavior before the commit this patch fixes.

    net: dsa: felix: fix min gate len calculation for tc when its first gate is closed

    commit 7e4babffa6f340a74c820d44d44d16511e666424 upstream.

    min_gate_len[tc] is supposed to track the shortest interval of
    continuously open gates for a traffic class. For example, in the
    following case:

    TC 76543210

    t0 00000001b 200000 ns
    t1 00000010b 200000 ns

    min_gate_len[0] and min_gate_len[1] should be 200000, while
    min_gate_len[2-7] should be 0.

    However what happens is that min_gate_len[0] is 200000, but
    min_gate_len[1] ends up being 0 (despite gate_len[1] being 200000 at the
    point where the logic detects the gate close event for TC 1).

    The problem is that the code considers a "gate close" event whenever it
    sees that there is a 0 for that TC (essentially it's level rather than
    edge triggered). By doing that, any time a gate is seen as closed
    without having been open prior, gate_len, which is 0, will be written
    into min_gate_len. Once min_gate_len becomes 0, it's impossible for it
    to track anything higher than that (the length of actually open
    intervals).

    To fix this, we make the writing to min_gate_len[tc] be edge-triggered,
    which avoids writes for gates that are closed in consecutive intervals.
    However what this does is it makes us need to special-case the
    permanently closed gates at the end.

    tracing: Use a copy of the va_list for __assign_vstr()

    commit 3a2dcbaf4d31023106975d6ae75b6df080c454cb upstream.

    If an instance of tracing enables the same trace event as another
    instance, or the top level instance, or even perf, then the va_list passed
    into some tracepoints can be used more than once.

    As va_list can only be traversed once, this can cause issues:

     # cat /sys/kernel/tracing/instances/qla2xxx/trace
                 cat-56106   [012] ..... 2419873.470098: ql_dbg_log: qla2xxx [0000:05:00.0]-1054:14:  Entered (null).

    The instance version is corrupted because the top level instance iterated
    the va_list first.

    Use va_copy() in the __assign_vstr() macro to make sure that each trace
    event for each use case gets a fresh va_list.

    crypto: lib/blake2s - reduce stack frame usage in self test

    commit d6c14da474bf260d73953fbf7992c98d9112aec7 upstream.

    Using 3 blocks here doesn't give us much more than using 2, and it
    causes a stack frame size warning on certain compiler/config/arch
    combinations:

       lib/crypto/blake2s-selftest.c: In function 'blake2s_selftest':
    >> lib/crypto/blake2s-selftest.c:632:1: warning: the frame size of 1088 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
         632 | }
             | ^

    So this patch just reduces the block from 3 to 2, which makes the
    warning go away.

    net_sched: cls_route: remove from list when handle is 0

    commit 9ad36309e2719a884f946678e0296be10f0bb4c1 upstream.

    When a route filter is replaced and the old filter has a 0 handle, the old
    one won't be removed from the hashtable, while it will still be freed.

    The test was there since before commit 1109c00547fc ("net: sched: RCU
    cls_route"), when a new filter was not allocated when there was an old one.
    The old filter was reused and the reinserting would only be necessary if an
    old filter was replaced. That was still wrong for the same case where the
    old handle was 0.

    Remove the old filter from the list independently from its handle value.

    This fixes CVE-2022-2588, also reported as ZDI-CAN-17440.

    commit 7d7672bc5d1038c745716c397d892d21e29de71c upstream.

    If count_max_extents() uses BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE to calculate the number
    of extents needed, btrfs release the metadata reservation too much on its
    way to write out the data.

    Now that BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE is replaced with fs_info->max_extent_size,
    convert count_max_extents() to use it instead, and fix the calculation of
    the metadata reservation.

    btrfs: join running log transaction when logging new name

    commit 723df2bcc9e166ac7fb82b3932a53e09415dfcde upstream.

    When logging a new name, in case of a rename, we pin the log before
    changing it. We then either delete a directory entry from the log or
    insert a key range item to mark the old name for deletion on log replay.

    However when doing one of those log changes we may have another task that
    started writing out the log (at btrfs_sync_log()) and it started before
    we pinned the log root. So we may end up changing a log tree while its
    writeback is being started by another task syncing the log. This can lead
    to inconsistencies in a log tree and other unexpected results during log
    replay, because we can get some committed node pointing to a node/leaf
    that ends up not getting written to disk before the next log commit.

    The problem, conceptually, started to happen in commit 88d2beec7e53fc
    ("btrfs: avoid logging all directory changes during renames"), because
    there we started to update the log without joining its current transaction
    first.

    However the problem only became visible with commit 259c4b96d78dda
    ("btrfs: stop doing unnecessary log updates during a rename"), and that is
    because we used to pin the log at btrfs_rename() and then before entering
    btrfs_log_new_name(), when unlinking the old dentry, we ended up at
    btrfs_del_inode_ref_in_log() and btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log(). Both
    of them join the current log transaction, effectively waiting for any log
    transaction writeout (due to acquiring the root's log_mutex). This made it
    safe even after leaving the current log transaction, because we remained
    with the log pinned when we called btrfs_log_new_name().

    Then in commit 259c4b96d78dda ("btrfs: stop doing unnecessary log updates
    during a rename"), we removed the log pinning from btrfs_rename() and
    stopped calling btrfs_del_inode_ref_in_log() and
    btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log() during the rename, and started to do all
    the needed work at btrfs_log_new_name(), but without joining the current
    log transaction, only pinning the log, which is racy because another task
    may have started writeout of the log tree right before we pinned the log.

    Both commits landed in kernel 5.18, so it doesn't make any practical
    difference which should be blamed, but I'm blaming the second commit only
    because with the first one, by chance, the problem did not happen due to
    the fact we joined the log transaction after pinning the log and unpinned
    it only after calling btrfs_log_new_name().

    So make btrfs_log_new_name() join the current log transaction instead of
    pinning it, so that we never do log updates if it's writeout is starting.

    xen-blkfront: Apply 'feature_persistent' parameter when connect

    commit 402c43ea6b34a1b371ffeed9adf907402569eaf5 upstream.

    In some use cases[1], the backend is created while the frontend doesn't
    support the persistent grants feature, but later the frontend can be
    changed to support the feature and reconnect.  In the past, 'blkback'
    enabled the persistent grants feature since it unconditionally checked
    if frontend supports the persistent grants feature for every connect
    ('connect_ring()') and decided whether it should use persistent grans or
    not.

    However, commit aac8a70db24b ("xen-blkback: add a parameter for
    disabling of persistent grants") has mistakenly changed the behavior.
    It made the frontend feature support check to not be repeated once it
    shown the 'feature_persistent' as 'false', or the frontend doesn't
    support persistent grants.

    Similar behavioral change has made on 'blkfront' by commit 74a852479c68
    ("xen-blkfront: add a parameter for disabling of persistent grants").
    This commit changes the behavior of the parameter to make effect for
    every connect, so that the previous behavior of 'blkfront' can be
    restored.

    support the persistent grants feature, but later the frontend can be
    changed to support the feature and reconnect.  In the past, 'blkback'
    enabled the persistent grants feature since it unconditionally checked
    if frontend supports the persistent grants feature for every connect
    ('connect_ring()') and decided whether it should use persistent grans or
    not.

    However, commit aac8a70db24b ("xen-blkback: add a parameter for
    disabling of persistent grants") has mistakenly changed the behavior.
    It made the frontend feature support check to not be repeated once it
    shown the 'feature_persistent' as 'false', or the frontend doesn't
    support persistent grants.

    This commit changes the behavior of the parameter to make effect for
    every connect, so that the previous workflow can work again as expected.

    xen-blkback: fix persistent grants negotiation

    commit fc9be616bb8f3ed9cf560308f86904f5c06be205 upstream.

    Persistent grants feature can be used only when both backend and the
    frontend supports the feature.  The feature was always supported by
    'blkback', but commit aac8a70db24b ("xen-blkback: add a parameter for
    disabling of persistent grants") has introduced a parameter for
    disabling it runtime.

    To avoid the parameter be updated while being used by 'blkback', the
    commit caches the parameter into 'vbd->feature_gnt_persistent' in
    'xen_vbd_create()', and then check if the guest also supports the
    feature and finally updates the field in 'connect_ring()'.

    However, 'connect_ring()' could be called before 'xen_vbd_create()', so
    later execution of 'xen_vbd_create()' can wrongly overwrite 'true' to
    'vbd->feature_gnt_persistent'.  As a result, 'blkback' could try to use
    'persistent grants' feature even if the guest doesn't support the
    feature.

    This commit fixes the issue by moving the parameter value caching to
    'xen_blkif_alloc()', which allocates the 'blkif'.  Because the struct
    embeds 'vbd' object, which will be used by 'connect_ring()' later, this
    should be called before 'connect_ring()' and therefore this should be
    the right and safe place to do the caching.

    tpm: Add check for Failure mode for TPM2 modules

    [ Upstream commit 863ed94c589fcd1984f4e3080f069d30508044bb ]

    In commit 0aa698787aa2 ("tpm: Add Upgrade/Reduced mode support for
    TPM2 modules") it was said that:

    "If the TPM is in Failure mode, it will successfully respond to both
    tpm2_do_selftest() and tpm2_startup() calls. Although, will fail to
    answer to tpm2_get_cc_attrs_tbl(). Use this fact to conclude that TPM
    is in Failure mode."

    But a check was never added in the commit when calling
    tpm2_get_cc_attrs_tbl() to conclude that the TPM is in Failure mode.
    This commit corrects this by adding a check.

    KEYS: asymmetric: enforce SM2 signature use pkey algo

    [ Upstream commit 0815291a8fd66cdcf7db1445d4d99b0d16065829 ]

    The signature verification of SM2 needs to add the Za value and
    recalculate sig->digest, which requires the detection of the pkey_algo
    in public_key_verify_signature(). As Eric Biggers said, the pkey_algo
    field in sig is attacker-controlled and should be use pkey->pkey_algo
    instead of sig->pkey_algo, and secondly, if sig->pkey_algo is NULL, it
    will also cause signature verification failure.

    The software_key_determine_akcipher() already forces the algorithms
    are matched, so the SM3 algorithm is enforced in the SM2 signature,
    although this has been checked, we still avoid using any algorithm
    information in the signature as input.

    ext4: fix race when reusing xattr blocks

    [ Upstream commit 65f8b80053a1b2fd602daa6814e62d6fa90e5e9b ]

    When ext4_xattr_block_set() decides to remove xattr block the following
    race can happen:

    CPU1                                    CPU2
    ext4_xattr_block_set()                  ext4_xattr_release_block()
      new_bh = ext4_xattr_block_cache_find()

                                              lock_buffer(bh);
                                              ref = le32_to_cpu(BHDR(bh)->h_refcount);
                                              if (ref == 1) {
                                                ...
                                                mb_cache_entry_delete();
                                                unlock_buffer(bh);
                                                ext4_free_blocks();
                                                  ...
                                                  ext4_forget(..., bh, ...);
                                                    jbd2_journal_revoke(..., bh);

      ext4_journal_get_write_access(..., new_bh, ...)
        do_get_write_access()
          jbd2_journal_cancel_revoke(..., new_bh);

    Later the code in ext4_xattr_block_set() finds out the block got freed
    and cancels reusal of the block but the revoke stays canceled and so in
    case of block reuse and journal replay the filesystem can get corrupted.
    If the race works out slightly differently, we can also hit assertions
    in the jbd2 code.

    Fix the problem by making sure that once matching mbcache entry is
    found, code dropping the last xattr block reference (or trying to modify
    xattr block in place) waits until the mbcache entry reference is
    dropped. This way code trying to reuse xattr block is protected from
    someone trying to drop the last reference to xattr block.

    ext4: remove EA inode entry from mbcache on inode eviction

    [ Upstream commit 6bc0d63dad7f9f54d381925ee855b402f652fa39 ]

    Currently we remove EA inode from mbcache as soon as its xattr refcount
    drops to zero. However there can be pending attempts to reuse the inode
    and thus refcount handling code has to handle the situation when
    refcount increases from zero anyway. So save some work and just keep EA
    inode in mbcache until it is getting evicted. At that moment we are sure
    following iget() of EA inode will fail anyway (or wait for eviction to
    finish and load things from the disk again) and so removing mbcache
    entry at that moment is fine and simplifies the code a bit.

    ext4: check if directory block is within i_size

    [ Upstream commit 65f8ea4cd57dbd46ea13b41dc8bac03176b04233 ]

    Currently ext4 directory handling code implicitly assumes that the
    directory blocks are always within the i_size. In fact ext4_append()
    will attempt to allocate next directory block based solely on i_size and
    the i_size is then appropriately increased after a successful
    allocation.

    However, for this to work it requires i_size to be correct. If, for any
    reason, the directory inode i_size is corrupted in a way that the
    directory tree refers to a valid directory block past i_size, we could
    end up corrupting parts of the directory tree structure by overwriting
    already used directory blocks when modifying the directory.

    Fix it by catching the corruption early in __ext4_read_dirblock().

    ext4: correct max_inline_xattr_value_size computing

    [ Upstream commit c9fd167d57133c5b748d16913c4eabc55e531c73 ]

    If the ext4 inode does not have xattr space, 0 is returned in the
    get_max_inline_xattr_value_size function. Otherwise, the function returns
    a negative value when the inode does not contain EXT4_STATE_XATTR.

    Above issue may happen as follows:
    -------------------------------------
    ext4_xattr_set
      ext4_xattr_set_handle
        ext4_xattr_ibody_find
          >> s->end < s->base
          >> no EXT4_STATE_XATTR
          >> xattr_check_inode is not executed
        ext4_xattr_ibody_set
          ext4_xattr_set_entry
           >> size_t min_offs = s->end - s->base
           >> UAF in memcpy

    we can easily reproduce this problem with the following commands:
        mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sda
        mount -o debug_want_extra_isize=128 /dev/sda /mnt
        touch /mnt/file
        setfattr -n user.cat -v `seq -s z 4096|tr -d '[:digit:]'` /mnt/file

    In ext4_xattr_ibody_find, we have the following assignment logic:
      header = IHDR(inode, raw_inode)
             = raw_inode + EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE + i_extra_isize
      is->s.base = IFIRST(header)
                 = header + sizeof(struct ext4_xattr_ibody_header)
      is->s.end = raw_inode + s_inode_size

    In ext4_xattr_set_entry
      min_offs = s->end - s->base
               = s_inode_size - EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE - i_extra_isize -
                 sizeof(struct ext4_xattr_ibody_header)
      last = s->first
      free = min_offs - ((void *)last - s->base) - sizeof(__u32)
           = s_inode_size - EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE - i_extra_isize -
             sizeof(struct ext4_xattr_ibody_header) - sizeof(__u32)

    In the calculation formula, all values except s_inode_size and
    i_extra_size are fixed values. When i_extra_size is the maximum value
    s_inode_size - EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE, min_offs is -4 and free is -8.
    The value overflows. As a result, the preceding issue is triggered when
    memcpy is executed.

    Therefore, when finding xattr or setting xattr, check whether
    there is space for storing xattr in the inode to resolve this issue.

    ext4: add EXT4_INODE_HAS_XATTR_SPACE macro in xattr.h

    [ Upstream commit 179b14152dcb6a24c3415200603aebca70ff13af ]

    When adding an xattr to an inode, we must ensure that the inode_size is
    not less than EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE + extra_isize + pad. Otherwise,
    the end position may be greater than the start position, resulting in UAF.

    ext4: fix extent status tree race in writeback error recovery path

    [ Upstream commit 7f0d8e1d607c1a4fa9a27362a108921d82230874 ]

    A race can occur in the unlikely event ext4 is unable to allocate a
    physical cluster for a delayed allocation in a bigalloc file system
    during writeback.  Failure to allocate a cluster forces error recovery
    that includes a call to mpage_release_unused_pages().  That function
    removes any corresponding delayed allocated blocks from the extent
    status tree.  If a new delayed write is in progress on the same cluster
    simultaneously, resulting in the addition of an new extent containing
    one or more blocks in that cluster to the extent status tree, delayed
    block accounting can be thrown off if that delayed write then encounters
    a similar cluster allocation failure during future writeback.

    Write lock the i_data_sem in mpage_release_unused_pages() to fix this
    problem.  Ext4's block/cluster accounting code for bigalloc relies on
    i_data_sem for mutual exclusion, as is found in the delayed write path,
    and the locking in mpage_release_unused_pages() is missing.

    ext4: update s_overhead_clusters in the superblock during an on-line resize

    [ Upstream commit de394a86658ffe4e89e5328fd4993abfe41b7435 ]

    When doing an online resize, the on-disk superblock on-disk wasn't
    updated.  This means that when the file system is unmounted and
    remounted, and the on-disk overhead value is non-zero, this would
    result in the results of statfs(2) to be incorrect.

    This was partially fixed by Commits 10b01ee92df5 ("ext4: fix overhead
    calculation to account for the reserved gdt blocks"), 85d825dbf489
    ("ext4: force overhead calculation if the s_overhead_cluster makes no
    sense"), and eb7054212eac ("ext4: update the cached overhead value in
    the superblock").

    However, since it was too expensive to forcibly recalculate the
    overhead for bigalloc file systems at every mount, this didn't fix the
    problem for bigalloc file systems.  This commit should address the
    problem when resizing file systems with the bigalloc feature enabled.

    ksmbd: prevent out of bound read for SMB2_WRITE

    OOB read memory can be written to a file,
    if DataOffset is 0 and Length is too large
    in SMB2_WRITE request of compound request.

    To prevent this, when checking the length of
    the data area of SMB2_WRITE in smb2_get_data_area_len(),
    let the minimum of DataOffset be the size of
    SMB2 header + the size of SMB2_WRITE header.

    This bug can lead an oops looking something like:

    ksmbd: validate length in smb2_write()

    [ Upstream commit 158a66b245739e15858de42c0ba60fcf3de9b8e6 ]

    The SMB2 Write packet contains data that is to be written
    to a file or to a pipe. Depending on the client, there may
    be padding between the header and the data field.
    Currently, the length is validated only in the case padding
    is present.

    Since the DataOffset field always points to the beginning
    of the data, there is no need to have a special case for
    padding. By removing this, the length is validated in both
    cases.

    tracing: Use a struct alignof to determine trace event field alignment

    [ Upstream commit 4c3d2f9388d36eb28640a220a6f908328442d873 ]

    alignof() gives an alignment of types as they would be as standalone
    variables. But alignment in structures might be different, and when
    building the fields of events, the alignment must be the actual
    alignment otherwise the field offsets may not match what they actually
    are.

    This caused trace-cmd to crash, as libtraceevent did not check if the
    field offset was bigger than the event. The write_msr and read_msr
    events on 32 bit had their fields incorrect, because it had a u64 field
    between two ints. alignof(u64) would give 8, but the u64 field was at a
    4 byte alignment.

    Define a macro as:

       ALIGN_STRUCTFIELD(type) ((int)(offsetof(struct {char a; type b;}, b)))

    which gives the actual alignment of types in a structure.

    The warning is caused by reading conf->max_nr_stripes in raid_status. The
    code in raid_status reads mddev->private, casts it to struct r5conf and
    reads the entry max_nr_stripes.

    However, if we have different raid type than 4/5/6, mddev->private
    doesn't point to struct r5conf; it may point to struct r0conf, struct
    r1conf, struct r10conf or struct mpconf. If we cast a pointer to one
    of these structs to struct r5conf, we will be reading invalid memory
    and KASAN warns about it.

    Fix this bug by reading struct r5conf only if raid type is 4, 5 or 6.

    KVM: nVMX: Attempt to load PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL on nVMX xfer iff it exists

    [ Upstream commit 4496a6f9b45e8cd83343ad86a3984d614e22cf54 ]

    Attempt to load PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL during nested VM-Enter/VM-Exit if and
    only if the MSR exists (according to the guest vCPU model).  KVM has very
    misguided handling of VM_{ENTRY,EXIT}_LOAD_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL and
    attempts to force the nVMX MSR settings to match the vPMU model, i.e. to
    hide/expose the control based on whether or not the MSR exists from the
    guest's perspective.

    KVM's modifications fail to handle the scenario where the vPMU is hidden
    from the guest _after_ being exposed to the guest, e.g. by userspace
    doing multiple KVM_SET_CPUID2 calls, which is allowed if done before any
    KVM_RUN.  nested_vmx_pmu_refresh() is called if and only if there's a
    recognized vPMU, i.e. KVM will leave the bits in the allow state and then
    ultimately reject the MSR load and WARN.

    KVM should not force the VMX MSRs in the first place.  KVM taking control
    of the MSRs was a misguided attempt at mimicking what commit 5f76f6f5ff96
    ("KVM: nVMX: Do not expose MPX VMX controls when guest MPX disabled",
    2018-10-01) did for MPX.  However, the MPX commit was a workaround for
    another KVM bug and not something that should be imitated (and it should
    never been done in the first place).

    In other words, KVM's ABI _should_ be that userspace has full control
    over the MSRs, at which point triggering the WARN that loading the MSR
    must not fail is trivial.

    The intent of the WARN is still valid; KVM has consistency checks to
    ensure that vmcs12->{guest,host}_ia32_perf_global_ctrl is valid.  The
    problem is that '0' must be considered a valid value at all times, and so
    the simple/obvious solution is to just not actually load the MSR when it
    does not exist.  It is userspace's responsibility to provide a sane vCPU
    model, i.e. KVM is well within its ABI and Intel's VMX architecture to
    skip the loads if the MSR does not exist.

    s390/unwind: fix fgraph return address recovery

    When HAVE_FUNCTION_GRAPH_RET_ADDR_PTR is defined, the return
    address to the fgraph caller is recovered by tagging it along with the
    stack pointer of ftrace stack. This makes the stack unwinding more
    reliable.

    When the fgraph return address is modified to return_to_handler,
    ftrace_graph_ret_addr tries to restore it to the original
    value using tagged stack pointer.

    Fix this by passing tagged sp to ftrace_graph_ret_addr.

    powerpc/powernv/kvm: Use darn for H_RANDOM on Power9

    [ Upstream commit 7ef3d06f1bc4a5e62273726f3dc2bd258ae1c71f ]

    The existing logic in KVM to support guests calling H_RANDOM only works
    on Power8, because it looks for an RNG in the device tree, but on Power9
    we just use darn.

    In addition the existing code needs to work in real mode, so we have the
    special cased powernv_get_random_real_mode() to deal with that.

    Instead just have KVM call ppc_md.get_random_seed(), and do the real
    mode check inside of there, that way we use whatever RNG is available,
    including darn on Power9.

    ACPI: CPPC: Do not prevent CPPC from working in the future

    [ Upstream commit 4f4179fcf420873002035cf1941d844c9e0e7cb3 ]

    There is a problem with the current revision checks in
    is_cppc_supported() that they essentially prevent the CPPC support
    from working if a new _CPC package format revision being a proper
    superset of the v3 and only causing _CPC to return a package with more
    entries (while retaining the types and meaning of the entries defined by
    the v3) is introduced in the future and used by the platform firmware.

    In that case, as long as the number of entries in the _CPC return
    package is at least CPPC_V3_NUM_ENT, it should be perfectly fine to
    use the v3 support code and disregard the additional package entries
    added by the new package format revision.

    For this reason, drop is_cppc_supported() altogether, put the revision
    checks directly into acpi_cppc_processor_probe() so they are easier to
    follow and rework them to take the case mentioned above into account.

    intel_idle: make SPR C1 and C1E be independent

    [ Upstream commit 1548fac47a114b42063def551eb152a536ed9697 ]

    This patch partially reverts the changes made by the following commit:

    da0e58c038e6 intel_idle: add 'preferred_cstates' module argument

    As that commit describes, on early Sapphire Rapids Xeon platforms the C1 and
    C1E states were mutually exclusive, so that users could only have either C1 and
    C6, or C1E and C6.

    However, Intel firmware engineers managed to remove this limitation and make C1
    and C1E to be completely independent, just like on previous Xeon platforms.

    Therefore, this patch:
     * Removes commentary describing the old, and now non-existing SPR C1E
       limitation.
     * Marks SPR C1E as available by default.
     * Removes the 'preferred_cstates' parameter handling for SPR. Both C1 and
       C1E will be available regardless of 'preferred_cstates' value.

    We expect that all SPR systems are shipping with new firmware, which includes
    the C1/C1E improvement.

    intel_idle: Add AlderLake support

    [ Upstream commit d1cf8bbfed1edc5108220342ab39e4544d55fbc3 ]

    Similar to SPR, the C1 and C1E states on ADL are mutually exclusive.
    Only one of them can be enabled at a time.

    But contrast to SPR, which usually has a strong latency requirement
    as a Xeon processor, C1E is preferred on ADL for better energy
    efficiency.

    Add custom C-state tables for ADL with both C1 and C1E, and

     1. Enable the "C1E promotion" bit in MSR_IA32_POWER_CTL and mark C1
        with the CPUIDLE_FLAG_UNUSABLE flag, so C1 is not available by
        default.

     2. Add support for the "preferred_cstates" module parameter, so that
        users can choose to use C1 instead of C1E by booting with
        "intel_idle.preferred_cstates=2".

    Separate custom C-state tables are introduced for the ADL mobile and
    desktop processors, because of the exit latency differences between
    these two variants, especially with respect to PC10.

    btrfs: zoned: wait until zone is finished when allocation didn't progress

    [ Upstream commit 2ce543f478433a0eec0f72090d7e814f1d53d456 ]

    When the allocated position doesn't progress, we cannot submit IOs to
    finish a block group, but there should be ongoing IOs that will finish a
    block group. So, in that case, we wait for a zone to be finished and retry
    the allocation after that.

    Introduce a new flag BTRFS_FS_NEED_ZONE_FINISH for fs_info->flags to
    indicate we need a zone finish to have proceeded. The flag is set when the
    allocator detected it cannot activate a new block group. And, it is cleared
    once a zone is finished.

    btrfs: zoned: write out partially allocated region

    [ Upstream commit 898793d992c23dac6126a6a94ad893eae1a2c9df ]

    cow_file_range() works in an all-or-nothing way: if it fails to allocate an
    extent for a part of the given region, it gives up all the region including
    the successfully allocated parts. On cow_file_range(), run_delalloc_zoned()
    writes data for the region only when it successfully allocate all the
    region.

    This all-or-nothing allocation and write-out are problematic when available
    space in all the block groups are get tight with the active zone
    restriction. btrfs_reserve_extent() try hard to utilize the left space in
    the active block groups and gives up finally and fails with
    -ENOSPC. However, if we send IOs for the successfully allocated region, we
    can finish a zone and can continue on the rest of the allocation on a newly
    allocated block group.

    This patch implements the partial write-out for run_delalloc_zoned(). With
    this patch applied, cow_file_range() returns -EAGAIN to tell the caller to
    do something to progress the further allocation, and tells the successfully
    allocated region with done_offset. Furthermore, the zoned extent allocator
    returns -EAGAIN to tell cow_file_range() going back to the caller side.

    Actually, we still need to wait for an IO to complete to continue the
    allocation. The next patch implements that part.

    btrfs: zoned: activate metadata block group on flush_space

    [ Upstream commit b0931513913633044ed6e3800334c28433c007b0 ]

    For metadata space on zoned filesystem, reaching ALLOC_CHUNK{,_FORCE}
    means we don't have enough space left in the active_total_bytes. Before
    allocating a new chunk, we can try to activate an existing block group
    in this case.

    Also, allocating a chunk is not enough to grant a ticket for metadata
    space on zoned filesystem we need to activate the block group to
    increase the active_total_bytes.

    btrfs_zoned_activate_one_bg() implements the activation feature. It will
    activate a block group by (maybe) finishing a block group. It will give up
    activating a block group if it cannot finish any block group.

    [ Upstream commit 6a921de589926a350634e6e279f43fa5b9dbf5ba ]

    The active_total_bytes, like the total_bytes, accounts for the total bytes
    of active block groups in the space_info.

    With an introduction of active_total_bytes, we can check if the reserved
    bytes can be written to the block groups without activating a new block
    group. The check is necessary for metadata allocation on zoned
    filesystem. We cannot finish a block group, which may require waiting
    for the current transaction, from the metadata allocation context.
    Instead, we need to ensure the ongoing allocation (reserved bytes) fits
    in active block groups.

    [ Upstream commit 79417d040f4f77b19c701bccc23013b9cdac358d ]

    The metadata overcommit makes the space reservation flexible but it is also
    harmful to active zone tracking. Since we cannot finish a block group from
    the metadata allocation context, we might not activate a new block group
    and might not be able to actually write out the overcommit reservations.

    So, disable metadata overcommit for zoned filesystems. We will ensure
    the reservations are under active_total_bytes in the following patches.

    btrfs: zoned: finish least available block group on data bg allocation

    [ Upstream commit 393f646e34c18b85d0f41272bfcbd475ae3a0d34 ]

    When we run out of active zones and no sufficient space is left in any
    block groups, we need to finish one block group to make room to activate a
    new block group.

    However, we cannot do this for metadata block groups because we can cause a
    deadlock by waiting for a running transaction commit. So, do that only for
    a data block group.

    Furthermore, the block group to be finished has two requirements. First,
    the block group must not have reserved bytes left. Having reserved bytes
    means we have an allocated region but did not yet send bios for it. If that
    region is allocated by the thread calling btrfs_zone_finish(), it results
    in a deadlock.

    Second, the block group to be finished must not be a SYSTEM block
    group. Finishing a SYSTEM block group easily breaks further chunk
    allocation by nullifying the SYSTEM free space.

    In a certain case, we cannot find any zone finish candidate or
    btrfs_zone_finish() may fail. In that case, we fall back to split the
    allocation bytes and fill the last spaces left in the block groups.

    btrfs: replace BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE with fs_info->max_extent_size

    [ Upstream commit f7b12a62f008a3041f42f2426983e59a6a0a3c59 ]

    On zoned filesystem, data write out is limited by max_zone_append_size,
    and a large ordered extent is split according the size of a bio. OTOH,
    the number of extents to be written is calculated using
    BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE, and that estimated number is used to reserve the
    metadata bytes to update and/or create the metadata items.

    The metadata reservation is done at e.g, btrfs_buffered_write() and then
    released according to the estimation changes. Thus, if the number of extent
    increases massively, the reserved metadata can run out.

    The increase of the number of extents easily occurs on zoned filesystem
    if BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE > max_zone_append_size. And, it causes the
    following warning on a small RAM environment with disabling metadata
    over-commit (in the following patch).

    To fix the estimation, we need to introduce fs_info->max_extent_size to
    replace BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE, which allow setting the different size for
    regular vs zoned filesystem.

    Set fs_info->max_extent_size to BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE by default. On zoned
    filesystem, it is set to fs_info->max_zone_append_size.

    btrfs: zoned: revive max_zone_append_bytes

    [ Upstream commit c2ae7b772ef4e86c5ddf3fd47bf59045ae96a414 ]

    This patch is basically a revert of commit 5a80d1c6a270 ("btrfs: zoned:
    remove max_zone_append_size logic"), but without unnecessary ASSERT and
    check. The max_zone_append_size will be used as a hint to estimate the
    number of extents to cover delalloc/writeback region in the later commits.

    The size of a ZONE APPEND bio is also limited by queue_max_segments(), so
    this commit considers it to calculate max_zone_append_size. Technically, a
    bio can be larger than queue_max_segments() * PAGE_SIZE if the pages are
    contiguous. But, it is safe to consider "queue_max_segments() * PAGE_SIZE"
    as an upper limit of an extent size to calculate the number of extents
    needed to write data.

    btrfs: properly flag filesystem with BTRFS_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_BIG_METADATA

    [ Upstream commit e26b04c4c91925dba57324db177a24e18e2d0013 ]

    Commit 6f93e834fa7c seemingly inadvertently moved the code responsible
    for flagging the filesystem as having BIG_METADATA to a place where
    setting the flag was essentially lost. This means that
    filesystems created with kernels containing this bug (starting with 5.15)
    can potentially be mounted by older (pre-3.4) kernels. In reality
    chances for this happening are low because there are other incompat
    flags introduced in the mean time. Still the correct behavior is to set
    INCOMPAT_BIG_METADATA flag and persist this in the superblock.

    btrfs: reset block group chunk force if we have to wait

    [ Upstream commit 1314ca78b2c35d3e7d0f097268a2ee6dc0d369ef ]

    If you try to force a chunk allocation, but you race with another chunk
    allocation, you will end up waiting on the chunk allocation that just
    occurred and then allocate another chunk.  If you have many threads all
    doing this at once you can way over-allocate chunks.

    Fix this by resetting force to NO_FORCE, that way if we think we need to
    allocate we can, otherwise we don't force another chunk allocation if
    one is already happening.

    btrfs: fix error handling of fallback uncompress write

    [ Upstream commit 71aa147b4d9d81fa65afa6016f50d7818b64a54f ]

    When cow_file_range() fails in the middle of the allocation loop, it
    unlocks the pages but leaves the ordered extents intact. Thus, we need
    to call btrfs_cleanup_ordered_extents() to finish the created ordered
    extents.

    Also, we need to call end_extent_writepage() if locked_page is available
    because btrfs_cleanup_ordered_extents() never processes the region on
    the locked_page.

    Furthermore, we need to set the mapping as error if locked_page is
    unavailable before unlocking the pages, so that the errno is properly
    propagated to the user space.

    While we debug the issue, we found running fstests generic/551 on 5GB
    non-zoned null_blk device in the emulated zoned mode also had a
    similar hung issue.

    Also, we can reproduce the same symptom with an error injected
    cow_file_range() setup.

    The hang occurs when cow_file_range() fails in the middle of
    allocation. cow_file_range() called from do_allocation_zoned() can
    split the give region ([start, end]) for allocation depending on
    current block group usages. When btrfs can allocate bytes for one part
    of the split regions but fails for the other region (e.g. because of
    -ENOSPC), we return the error leaving the pages in the succeeded regions
    locked. Technically, this occurs only when @unlock == 0. Otherwise, we
    unlock the pages in an allocated region after creating an ordered
    extent.

    Considering the callers of cow_file_range(unlock=0) won't write out
    the pages, we can unlock the pages on error exit from
    cow_file_range(). So, we can ensure all the pages except @locked_page
    are unlocked on error case.

    In summary, cow_file_range now behaves like this:

    - page_started == 1 (return value)
      - All the pages are unlocked. IO is started.
    - unlock == 1
      - All the pages except @locked_page are unlocked in any case
    - unlock == 0
      - On success, all the pages are locked for writing out them
      - On failure, all the pages except @locked_page are unlocked

    btrfs: tree-log: make the return value for log syncing consistent

    [ Upstream commit f31f09f6be1c6c1a673e0566e258281a7bbaaa51 ]

    Currently we will return 1 or -EAGAIN if we decide we need to commit
    the transaction rather than sync the log.  In practice this doesn't
    really matter, we interpret any !0 and !BTRFS_NO_LOG_SYNC as needing to
    commit the transaction.  However this makes it hard to figure out what
    the correct thing to do is.

    Fix this up by defining BTRFS_LOG_FORCE_COMMIT and using this in all the
    places where we want to force the transaction to be committed.

    block: don't allow the same type rq_qos add more than once

    [ Upstream commit 14a6e2eb7df5c7897c15b109cba29ab0c4a791b6 ]

    In our test of iocost, we encountered some list add/del corruptions of
    inner_walk list in ioc_timer_fn.

    The reason can be described as follows:

    cpu 0                                   cpu 1
    ioc_qos_write                           ioc_qos_write

    ioc = q_to_ioc(queue);
    if (!ioc) {
            ioc = kzalloc();
                                            ioc = q_to_ioc(queue);
                                            if (!ioc) {
                                                    ioc = kzalloc();
                                                    ...
                                                    rq_qos_add(q, rqos);
                                            }
            ...
            rq_qos_add(q, rqos);
            ...
    }

    When the io.cost.qos file is written by two cpus concurrently, rq_qos may
    be added to one disk twice. In that case, there will be two iocs enabled
    and running on one disk. They own different iocgs on their active list. In
    the ioc_timer_fn function, because of the iocgs from two iocs have the
    same root iocg, the root iocg's walk_list may be overwritten by each other
    and this leads to list add/del corruptions in building or destroying the
    inner_walk list.

    And so far, the blk-rq-qos framework works in case that one instance for
    one type rq_qos per queue by default. This patch make this explicit and
    also fix the crash above.

    locking/csd_lock: Change csdlock_debug from early_param to __setup

    [ Upstream commit 9c9b26b0df270d4f9246e483a44686fca951a29c ]

    The csdlock_debug kernel-boot parameter is parsed by the
    early_param() function csdlock_debug().  If set, csdlock_debug()
    invokes static_branch_enable() to enable csd_lock_wait feature, which
    triggers a panic on arm64 for kernels built with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y and
    CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n.

    With CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n, __nr_to_section is called in
    static_key_enable() and returns NULL, resulting in a NULL dereference
    because mem_section is initialized only later in sparse_init().

    This is also a problem for powerpc because early_param() functions
    are invoked earlier than jump_label_init(), also resulting in
    static_key_enable() failures.  These failures cause the warning "static
    key 'xxx' used before call to jump_label_init()".

    Thus, early_param is too early for csd_lock_wait to run
    static_branch_enable(), so changes it to __setup to fix these.

    timekeeping: contribute wall clock to rng on time change

    [ Upstream commit b8ac29b40183a6038919768b5d189c9bd91ce9b4 ]

    The rng's random_init() function contributes the real time to the rng at
    boot time, so that events can at least start in relation to something
    particular in the real world. But this clock might not yet be set that
    point in boot, so nothing is contributed. In addition, the relation
    between minor clock changes from, say, NTP, and the cycle counter is
    potentially useful entropic data.

    This commit addresses this by mixing in a time stamp on calls to
    settimeofday and adjtimex. No entropy is credited in doing so, so it
    doesn't make initialization faster, but it is still useful input to
    have.

    net/9p: Initialize the iounit field during fid creation

    [ Upstream commit aa7aeee169480e98cf41d83c01290a37e569be6d ]

    Ensure that the fid's iounit field is set to zero when a new fid is
    created. Certain 9P operations, such as OPEN and CREATE, allow the
    server to reply with an iounit size which the client code assigns to the
    p9_fid struct shortly after the fid is created by p9_fid_create(). On
    the other hand, an XATTRWALK operation doesn't allow for the server to
    specify an iounit value. The iounit field of the newly allocated p9_fid
    struct remained uninitialized in that case. Depending on allocation
    patterns, the iounit value could have been something reasonable that was
    carried over from previously freed fids or, in the worst case, could
    have been arbitrary values from non-fid related usages of the memory
    location.

    The bug was detected in the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) kernel
    after the uninitialized iounit field resulted in the typical sequence of
    two getxattr(2) syscalls, one to get the size of an xattr and another
    after allocating a sufficiently sized buffer to fit the xattr value, to
    hit an unexpected ERANGE error in the second call to getxattr(2). An
    uninitialized iounit field would sometimes force rsize to be smaller
    than the xattr value size in p9_client_read_once() and the 9P server in
    WSL refused to chunk up the READ on the attr_fid and, instead, returned
    ERANGE to the client. The virtfs server in QEMU seems happy to chunk up
    the READ and this problem goes undetected there.

    tracing/events: Add __vstring() and __assign_vstr() helper macros

    [ Upstream commit 0563231f93c6d1f582b168a47753b345c1e20d81 ]

    There's several places that open code the following logic:

      TP_STRUCT__entry(__dynamic_array(char, msg, MSG_MAX)),
      TP_fast_assign(vsnprintf(__get_str(msg), MSG_MAX, vaf->fmt, *vaf->va);)

    To load a string created by variable array va_list.

    The main issue with this approach is that "MSG_MAX" usage in the
    __dynamic_array() portion. That actually just reserves the MSG_MAX in the
    event, and even wastes space because there's dynamic meta data also saved
    in the event to denote the offset and size of the dynamic array. It would
    have been better to just use a static __array() field.

    Instead, create __vstring() and __assign_vstr() that work like __string
    and __assign_str() but instead of taking a destination string to copy,
    take a format string and a va_list pointer and fill in the values.

    It uses the helper:

     #define __trace_event_vstr_len(fmt, va)                \
     ({                                                     \
            va_list __ap;                                   \
            int __ret;                                      \
                                                            \
            va_copy(__ap, *(va));                           \
            __ret = vsnprintf(NULL, 0, fmt, __ap) + 1;      \
            va_end(__ap);                                   \
                                                            \
            min(__ret, TRACE_EVENT_STR_MAX);                \
     })

    To figure out the length to store the string. It may be slightly slower as
    it needs to run the vsnprintf() twice, but it now saves space on the ring
    buffer.

    kexec_file: drop weak attribute from functions

    [ Upstream commit 65d9a9a60fd71be964effb2e94747a6acb6e7015 ]

    As requested
    (http://lkml.kernel.org/r/87ee0q7b92.fsf@email.froward.int.ebiederm.org),
    this series converts weak functions in kexec to use the #ifdef approach.

    Quoting the 3e35142ef99fe ("kexec_file: drop weak attribute from
    arch_kexec_apply_relocations[_add]") changelog:

    : Since commit d1bcae833b32f1 ("ELF: Don't generate unused section symbols")
    : [1], binutils (v2.36+) started dropping section symbols that it thought
    : were unused.  This isn't an issue in general, but with kexec_file.c, gcc
    : is placing kexec_arch_apply_relocations[_add] into a separate
    : .text.unlikely section and the section symbol ".text.unlikely" is being
    : dropped.  Due to this, recordmcount is unable to find a non-weak symbol in
    : .text.unlikely to generate a relocation record against.

    This patch (of 2);

    Drop __weak attribute from functions in kexec_file.c:
    - arch_kexec_kernel_image_probe()
    - arch_kimage_file_post_load_cleanup()
    - arch_kexec_kernel_image_load()
    - arch_kexec_locate_mem_hole()
    - arch_kexec_kernel_verify_sig()

    arch_kexec_kernel_image_load() calls into kexec_image_load_default(), so
    drop the static attribute for the latter.

    arch_kexec_kernel_verify_sig() is not overridden by any architecture, so
    drop the __weak attribute.

    serial: 8250: Add proper clock handling for OxSemi PCIe devices

    [ Upstream commit 366f6c955d4d1a5125ffcd6875ead26a3c7a2a1c ]

    Oxford Semiconductor PCIe (Tornado) 950 serial port devices are driven
    by a fixed 62.5MHz clock input derived from the 100MHz PCI Express clock.

    We currently drive the device using its default oversampling rate of 16
    and the clock prescaler disabled, consequently yielding the baud base of
    3906250.  This base is inadequate for some of the high-speed baud rates
    such as 460800bps, for which the closest rate possible can be obtained
    by dividing the baud base by 8, yielding the baud rate of 488281.25bps,
    which is off by 5.9638%.  This is enough for data communication to break
    with the remote end talking actual 460800bps, where missed stop bits
    have been observed.

    We can do better however, by taking advantage of a reduced oversampling
    rate, which can be set to any integer value from 4 to 16 inclusive by
    programming the TCR register, and by using the clock prescaler, which
    can be set to any value from 1 to 63.875 in increments of 0.125 in the
    CPR/CPR2 register pair.  The prescaler has to be explicitly enabled
    though by setting bit 7 in the MCR or otherwise it is bypassed (in the
    enhanced mode that we enable) as if the value of 1 was used.

    Make use of these features then as follows:

    - Set the baud base to 15625000, reflecting the minimum oversampling
      rate of 4 with the clock prescaler and divisor both set to 1.

    - Override the `set_mctrl' and set the MCR shadow there so as to have
      MCR[7] always set and have the 8250 core propagate these settings.

    - Override the `get_divisor' handler and determine a good combination of
      parameters by using a lookup table with predetermined value pairs of
      the oversampling rate and the clock prescaler and finding a pair that
      divides the input clock such that the quotient, when rounded to the
      nearest integer, deviates the least from the exact result.  Calculate
      the clock divisor accordingly.

      Scale the resulting oversampling rate (only by powers of two) if
      possible so as to maximise it, reducing the divisor accordingly, and
      avoid a divisor overflow for very low baud rates by scaling the
      oversampling rate and/or the prescaler even if that causes some
      accuracy loss.

      Also handle the historic spd_cust feature so as to allow one to set
      all the three parameters manually to arbitrary values, by keeping the
      low 16 bits for the divisor and then putting TCR in bits 19:16 and
      CPR/CPR2 in bits 28:20, sanitising the bit pattern supplied such as
      to clamp CPR/CPR2 values between 0.000 and 0.875 inclusive to 33.875.
      This preserves compatibility with any existing setups, that is where
      requesting a custom divisor that only has any bits set among the low
      16 the oversampling rate of 16 and the clock prescaler of 33.875 will
      be used as with the original 8250.

      Finally abuse the `frac' argument to store the determined bit patterns
      for the TCR, CPR and CPR2 registers.

    - Override the `set_divisor' handler so as to set the TCR, CPR and CPR2
      registers from the `frac' value supplied.  Set the divisor as usual.

    With the baud base set to 15625000 and the unsigned 16-bit UART_DIV_MAX
    limitation imposed by `serial8250_get_baud_rate' standard baud rates
    below 300bps become unavailable in the regular way, e.g. the rate of
    200bps requires the baud base to be divided by 78125 and that is beyond
    the unsigned 16-bit range.  The historic spd_cust feature can still be
    used to obtain such rates if so required.

    serial: 8250: Fold EndRun device support into OxSemi Tornado code

    [ Upstream commit 1f32c65bad24b9787d3e52843de375430e3df822 ]

    The EndRun PTP/1588 dual serial port device is based on the Oxford
    Semiconductor OXPCIe952 UART device with the PCI vendor:device ID set
    for EndRun Technologies and uses the same sequence to determine the
    number of ports available.  Despite that we have duplicate code
    specific to the EndRun device.

    Remove redundant code then and factor out OxSemi Tornado device
    detection.

    to an insane array index when calculating bit position in memory.

    For now, add an explicit check for @node being not %NUMA_NO_NODE
    before calling test_bit(). The actual logics didn't change here
    at all.

    KVM: set_msr_mce: Permit guests to ignore single-bit ECC errors

    [ Upstream commit 0471a7bd1bca2a47a5f378f2222c5cf39ce94152 ]

    Certain guest operating systems (e.g., UNIXWARE) clear bit 0 of
    MC1_CTL to ignore single-bit ECC data errors.  Single-bit ECC data
    errors are always correctable and thus are safe to ignore because they
    are informational in nature rather than signaling a loss of data
    integrity.

    Prior to this patch, these guests would crash upon writing MC1_CTL,
    with resultant error messages like the following:

    usbnet: smsc95xx: Fix deadlock on runtime resume

    [ Upstream commit 7b960c967f2aa01ab8f45c5a0bd78e754cffdeee ]

    Commit 05b35e7eb9a1 ("smsc95xx: add phylib support") amended
    smsc95xx_resume() to call phy_init_hw().  That function waits for the
    device to runtime resume even though it is placed in the runtime resume
    path, causing a deadlock.

    The problem is that phy_init_hw() calls down to smsc95xx_mdiobus_read(),
    which never uses the _nopm variant of usbnet_read_cmd().

    Commit b4df480f68ae ("usbnet: smsc95xx: add reset_resume function with
    reset operation") causes a similar deadlock on resume if the device was
    already runtime suspended when entering system sleep:

    That's because the commit introduced smsc95xx_reset_resume(), which
    calls down to smsc95xx_reset(), which neglects to use _nopm accessors.

    Fix by auto-detecting whether a device access is performed by the
    suspend/resume task_struct and use the _nopm variant if so.  This works
    because the PM core guarantees that suspend/resume callbacks are run in
    task context.

    usbnet: smsc95xx: Forward PHY interrupts to PHY driver to avoid polling

    [ Upstream commit 1ce8b37241ed291af56f7a49bbdbf20c08728e88 ]

    Link status of SMSC LAN95xx chips is polled once per second, even though
    they're capable of signaling PHY interrupts through the MAC layer.

    Forward those interrupts to the PHY driver to avoid polling.  Benefits
    are reduced bus traffic, reduced CPU overhead and quicker interface
    bringup.

    Polling was introduced in 2016 by commit d69d16949346 ("usbnet:
    smsc95xx: fix link detection for disabled autonegotiation").
    Back then, the LAN95xx driver neglected to enable the ENERGYON interrupt,
    hence couldn't detect link-up events when auto-negotiation was disabled.
    The proper solution would have been to enable the ENERGYON interrupt
    instead of polling.

    Since then, PHY handling was moved from the LAN95xx driver to the SMSC
    PHY driver with commit 05b35e7eb9a1 ("smsc95xx: add phylib support").
    That PHY driver is capable of link detection with auto-negotiation
    disabled because it enables the ENERGYON interrupt.

    Note that signaling interrupts through the MAC layer not only works with
    the integrated PHY, but also with an external PHY, provided its
    interrupt pin is attached to LAN95xx's nPHY_INT pin.

    In the unlikely event that the interrupt pin of an external PHY is
    attached to a GPIO of the SoC (or not connected at all), the driver can
    be amended to retrieve the irq from the PHY's of_node.

    To forward PHY interrupts to phylib, it is not sufficient to call
    phy_mac_interrupt().  Instead, the PHY's interrupt handler needs to run
    so that PHY interrupts are cleared.  That's because according to page
    119 of the LAN950x datasheet, "The source of this interrupt is a level.
    The interrupt persists until it is cleared in the PHY."

    https://www.microchip.com/content/dam/mchp/documents/UNG/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/LAN950x-Data-Sheet-DS00001875D.pdf

    Therefore, create an IRQ domain with a single IRQ for the PHY.  In the
    future, the IRQ domain may be extended to support the 11 GPIOs on the
    LAN95xx.

    Normally the PHY interrupt should be masked until the PHY driver has
    cleared it.  However masking requires a (sleeping) USB transaction and
    interrupts are received in (non-sleepable) softirq context.  I decided
    not to mask the interrupt at all (by using the dummy_irq_chip's noop
    ->irq_mask() callback):  The USB interrupt endpoint is polled in 1 msec
    intervals and normally that's sufficient to wake the PHY driver's IRQ
    thread and have it clear the interrupt.  If it does take longer, worst
    thing that can happen is the IRQ thread is woken again.  No big deal.

    Because PHY interrupts are now perpetually enabled, there's no need to
    selectively enable them on suspend.  So remove all invocations of
    smsc95xx_enable_phy_wakeup_interrupts().

    In smsc95xx_resume(), move the call of phy_init_hw() before

    usbnet: smsc95xx: Avoid link settings race on interrupt reception

    [ Upstream commit 8960f878e39fadc03d74292a6731f1e914cf2019 ]

    When a PHY interrupt is signaled, the SMSC LAN95xx driver updates the
    MAC full duplex mode and PHY flow control registers based on cached data
    in struct phy_device:

      smsc95xx_status()                 # raises EVENT_LINK_RESET
        usbnet_deferred_kevent()
          smsc95xx_link_reset()         # uses cached data in phydev

    Simultaneously, phylib polls link status once per second and updates
    that cached data:

      phy_state_machine()
        phy_check_link_status()
          phy_read_status()
            lan87xx_read_status()
              genphy_read_status()      # updates cached data in phydev

    If smsc95xx_link_reset() wins the race against genphy_read_status(),
    the registers may be updated based on stale data.

    E.g. if the link was previously down, phydev->duplex is set to
    DUPLEX_UNKNOWN and that's what smsc95xx_link_reset() will use, even
    though genphy_read_status() may update it to DUPLEX_FULL afterwards.

    PHY interrupts are currently only enabled on suspend to trigger wakeup,
    so the impact of the race is limited, but we're about to enable them
    perpetually.

    Avoid the race by delaying execution of smsc95xx_link_reset() until
    phy_state_machine() has done its job and calls back via
    smsc95xx_handle_link_change().

    Signaling EVENT_LINK_RESET on wakeup is not necessary because phylib
    picks up link status changes through polling.  So drop the declaration
    of a ->link_reset() callback.

    Note that the semicolon on a line by itself added in smsc95xx_status()
    is a placeholder for a function call which will be added in a subsequent
    commit.  That function call will actually handle the INT_ENP_PHY_INT_
    interrupt.

    usbnet: smsc95xx: Don't clear read-only PHY interrupt

    [ Upstream commit 3108871f19221372b251f7da1ac38736928b5b3a ]

    Upon receiving data from the Interrupt Endpoint, the SMSC LAN95xx driver
    attempts to clear the signaled interrupts by writing "all ones" to the
    Interrupt Status Register.

    However the driver only ever enables a single type of interrupt, namely
    the PHY Interrupt.  And according to page 119 of the LAN950x datasheet,
    its bit in the Interrupt Status Register is read-only.  There's no other
    way to clear it than in a separate PHY register:

    https://www.microchip.com/content/dam/mchp/documents/UNG/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/LAN950x-Data-Sheet-DS00001875D.pdf

    Consequently, writing "all ones" to the Interrupt Status Register is
    pointless and can be dropped.

    drm/vc4: drv: Adopt the dma configuration from the HVS or V3D component

    [ Upstream commit da8e393e23efb60eba8959856c7df88f9859f6eb ]

    vc4_drv isn't necessarily under the /soc node in DT as it is a
    virtual device, but it is the one that does the allocations.
    The DMA addresses are consumed by primarily the HVS or V3D, and
    those require VideoCore cache alias address mapping, and so will be
    under /soc.

    During probe find the a suitable device node for HVS or V3D,
    and adopt the DMA configuration of that node.

    crypto: blake2s - remove shash module

    [ Upstream commit 2d16803c562ecc644803d42ba98a8e0aef9c014e ]

    BLAKE2s has no currently known use as an shash. Just remove all of this
    unnecessary plumbing. Removing this shash was something we talked about
    back when we were making BLAKE2s a built-in, but I simply never got
    around to doing it. So this completes that project.

    Importantly, this fixs a bug in which the lib code depends on
    crypto_simd_disabled_for_test, causing linker errors.

    Also add more alignment tests to the selftests and compare SIMD and
    non-SIMD compression functions, to make up for what we lose from
    testmgr.c.

    drm/mediatek: Keep dsi as LP00 before dcs cmds transfer

    [ Upstream commit 39e8d062b03c3dc257d880d82bd55cdd9e185a3b ]

    To comply with the panel sequence, hold the mipi signal to LP00 before
    the dcs cmds transmission, and pull the mipi signal high from LP00 to
    LP11 until the start of the dcs cmds transmission.

    The normal panel timing is :
    (1) pp1800 DC pull up
    (2) avdd & avee AC pull high
    (3) lcm_reset pull high -> pull low -> pull high
    (4) Pull MIPI signal high (LP11) -> initial code -> send video data
        (HS mode)

    The power-off sequence is reversed.
    If dsi is not in cmd mode, then dsi will pull the mipi signal high in
    the mtk_output_dsi_enable function. The delay in lane_ready func is
    the reaction time of dsi_rx after pulling up the mipi signal.

    drivers/base: fix userspace break from using bin_attributes for cpumap and cpulist

    commit 7ee951acd31a88f941fd6535fbdee3a1567f1d63 upstream.

    Using bin_attributes with a 0 size causes fstat and friends to return that
    0 size. This breaks userspace code that retrieves the size before reading
    the file. Rather than reverting 75bd50fa841 ("drivers/base/node.c: use
    bin_attribute to break the size limitation of cpumap ABI") let's put in a
    size value at compile time.

    For cpulist the maximum size is on the order of
            NR_CPUS * (ceil(log10(NR_CPUS)) + 1)/2

    which for 8192 is 20480 (8192 * 5)/2. In order to get near that you'd need
    a system with every other CPU on one node. For example: (0,2,4,8, ... ).
    To simplify the math and support larger NR_CPUS in the future we are using
    (NR_CPUS * 7)/2. We also set it to a min of PAGE_SIZE to retain the older
    behavior for smaller NR_CPUS.

    The cpumap file the size works out to be NR_CPUS/4 + NR_CPUS/32 - 1
    (or NR_CPUS * 9/32 - 1) including the ","s.

    Add a set of macros for these values to cpumask.h so they can be used in
    multiple places. Apply these to the handful of such files in
    drivers/base/topology.c as well as node.c.

    As an example, on an 80 cpu 4-node system (NR_CPUS == 8192):

    before:

    -r--r--r--. 1 root root 0 Jul 12 14:08 system/node/node0/cpulist
    -r--r--r--. 1 root root 0 Jul 11 17:25 system/node/node0/cpumap

    after:

    -r--r--r--. 1 root root 28672 Jul 13 11:32 system/node/node0/cpulist
    -r--r--r--. 1 root root  4096 Jul 13 11:31 system/node/node0/cpumap

    CONFIG_NR_CPUS = 16384
    -r--r--r--. 1 root root 57344 Jul 13 14:03 system/node/node0/cpulist
    -r--r--r--. 1 root root  4607 Jul 13 14:02 system/node/node0/cpumap

    The actual number of cpus doesn't matter for the reported size since they
    are based on NR_CPUS.

    spmi: trace: fix stack-out-of-bound access in SPMI tracing functions

    commit 2af28b241eea816e6f7668d1954f15894b45d7e3 upstream.

    trace_spmi_write_begin() and trace_spmi_read_end() both call
    memcpy() with a length of "len + 1".  This leads to one extra
    byte being read beyond the end of the specified buffer.  Fix

    instead.

    __follow_mount_rcu(): verify that mount_lock remains unchanged

    commit 20aac6c60981f5bfacd66661d090d907bf1482f0 upstream.

    Validate mount_lock seqcount as soon as we cross into mount in RCU
    mode.  Sure, ->mnt_root is pinned and will remain so until we
    do rcu_read_unlock() anyway, and we will eventually fail to unlazy if
    the mount_lock had been touched, but we might run into a hard error
    (e.g. -ENOENT) before trying to unlazy.  And it's possible to end
    up with RCU pathwalk racing with rename() and umount() in a way
    that would fail with -ENOENT while non-RCU pathwalk would've
    succeeded with any timings.

    Once upon a time we hadn't needed that, but analysis had been subtle,
    brittle and went out of window as soon as RENAME_EXCHANGE had been
    added.

    It's narrow, hard to hit and won't get you anything other than
    stray -ENOENT that could be arranged in much easier way with the
    same priveleges, but it's a bug all the same.

    posix-cpu-timers: Cleanup CPU timers before freeing them during exec

    commit e362359ace6f87c201531872486ff295df306d13 upstream.

    Commit 55e8c8eb2c7b ("posix-cpu-timers: Store a reference to a pid not a
    task") started looking up tasks by PID when deleting a CPU timer.

    When a non-leader thread calls execve, it will switch PIDs with the leader
    process. Then, as it calls exit_itimers, posix_cpu_timer_del cannot find
    the task because the timer still points out to the old PID.

    That means that armed timers won't be disarmed, that is, they won't be
    removed from the timerqueue_list. exit_itimers will still release their
    memory, and when that list is later processed, it leads to a
    use-after-free.

    Clean up the timers from the de-threaded task before freeing them. This
    prevents a reported use-after-free.

    commit 9e31678fb403eae0f4fe37c6374be098835c73cd upstream.

    Solution is to send lease break ack immediately even in case of
    deferred close handles to avoid lease break request timing out
    and let deferred closed handle gets closed as scheduled.
    Later patches could optimize cases where we then close some
    of these handles sooner for the cases where lease break is to 'none'

    x86/olpc: fix 'logical not is only applied to the left hand side'

    commit 3a2ba42cbd0b669ce3837ba400905f93dd06c79f upstream.

    The bitops compile-time optimization series revealed one more
    problem in olpc-xo1-sci.c:send_ebook_state(), resulted in GCC
    warnings:

    arch/x86/platform/olpc/olpc-xo1-sci.c: In function 'send_ebook_state':
    arch/x86/platform/olpc/olpc-xo1-sci.c:83:63: warning: logical not is only applied to the left hand side of comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
       83 |         if (!!test_bit(SW_TABLET_MODE, ebook_switch_idev->sw) == state)

    arch/x86/platform/olpc/olpc-xo1-sci.c:83:13: note: add parentheses around left hand side expression to silence this warning

    Despite this code working as intended, this redundant double
    negation of boolean value, together with comparing to `char`
    with no explicit conversion to bool, makes compilers think
    the author made some unintentional logical mistakes here.
    Make it the other way around and negate the char instead
    to silence the warnings.

    x86/kprobes: Update kcb status flag after singlestepping

    commit dec8784c9088b131a1523f582c2194cfc8107dc0 upstream.

    Fix kprobes to update kcb (kprobes control block) status flag to
    KPROBE_HIT_SSDONE even if the kp->post_handler is not set.

    This bug may cause a kernel panic if another INT3 user runs right
    after kprobes because kprobe_int3_handler() misunderstands the
    INT3 is kprobe's single stepping INT3.

    ftrace/x86: Add back ftrace_expected assignment

    commit ac6c1b2ca77e722a1e5d651f12f437f2f237e658 upstream.

    When a ftrace_bug happens (where ftrace fails to modify a location) it is
    helpful to have what was at that location as well as what was expected to
    be there.

    But with the conversion to text_poke() the variable that assigns the
    expected for debugging was dropped. Unfortunately, I noticed this when I
    needed it. Add it back.

    x86/bugs: Enable STIBP for IBPB mitigated RETBleed

    commit e6cfcdda8cbe81eaf821c897369a65fec987b404 upstream.

    AMD's "Technical Guidance for Mitigating Branch Type Confusion,
    Rev. 1.0 2022-07-12" whitepaper, under section 6.1.2 "IBPB On
    Privileged Mode Entry / SMT Safety" says:

      Similar to the Jmp2Ret mitigation, if the code on the sibling thread
      cannot be trusted, software should set STIBP to 1 or disable SMT to
      ensure SMT safety when using this mitigation.

    So, like already being done for retbleed=unret, and now also for
    retbleed=ibpb, force STIBP on machines that have it, and report its SMT
    vulnerability status accordingly.

     [ bp: Remove the "we" and remove "[AMD]" applicability parameter which
       doesn't work here. ]

    commit 58d1c124cd79ea686b512043c5bd515590b2ed95 upstream.

    When a mix of FCP-2 (tape) and non-FCP-2 targets are present, FCP-2 target
    state was incorrectly transitioned when both of the targets were gone. Fix
    this by ignoring state transition for FCP-2 targets.

    scsi: zfcp: Fix missing auto port scan and thus missing target ports

    commit 4da8c5f76825269f28d6a89fa752934a4bcb6dfa upstream.

    Case (1):
      The only waiter on wka_port->completion_wq is zfcp_fc_wka_port_get()
      trying to open a WKA port. As such it should only be woken up by WKA port
      *open* responses, not by WKA port close responses.

    Case (2):
      A close WKA port response coming in just after having sent a new open WKA
      port request and before blocking for the open response with wait_event()
      in zfcp_fc_wka_port_get() erroneously renders the wait_event a NOP
      because the close handler overwrites wka_port->status. Hence the
      wait_event condition is erroneously true and it does not enter blocking
      state.

    With non-negligible probability, the following time space sequence happens
    depending on timing without this fix:

    So we erroneously end up with no automatic port scan. This is a big problem
    when it happens during boot. The timing is influenced by v3.19 commit
    18f87a67e6d6 ("zfcp: auto port scan resiliency").

    Fix it by fully mutually excluding zfcp_fc_wka_port_get() and
    zfcp_fc_wka_port_offline(). For that to work, we make the latter block
    until we got the response for a close WKA port. In order not to penalize
    the system workqueue, we move wka_port->work to our own adapter workqueue.
    Note that before v2.6.30 commit 828bc1212a68 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Set WKA-port to
    offline on adapter deactivation"), zfcp did block in
    zfcp_fc_wka_port_offline() as well, but with a different condition.

    While at it, make non-functional cleanups to improve code reading in
    zfcp_fc_wka_port_get(). If we cannot send the WKA port open request, don't
    rely on the subsequent wait_event condition to immediately let this case
    pass without blocking. Also don't want to rely on the additional condition
    handling the refcount to be skipped just to finally return with -EIO.

    scsi: ufs: core: Correct ufshcd_shutdown() flow

    commit 00511d2abf5708ad05dd5d1c36adb2468d274698 upstream.

    After ufshcd_wl_shutdown() set device power off and link off,
    ufshcd_shutdown() could turn off clock/power. Also remove
    pm_runtime_get_sync.

    The reason why it is safe to remove pm_runtime_get_sync() is because:

     - ufshcd_wl_shutdown() -> pm_runtime_get_sync() will resume hba->dev too.

     - device resume(turn on clk/power) is not required, even if device is in
       RPM_SUSPENDED.

    f2fs: do not allow to decompress files have FI_COMPRESS_RELEASED

    [ Upstream commit 90be48bd9d29ece3965e5e8b21499b6db166e57b ]

    If a file has FI_COMPRESS_RELEASED, all writes for it should not be
    allowed. However, as of now, in case of compress_mode=user, writes
    triggered by IOCTLs like F2FS_IOC_DE/COMPRESS_FILE are allowed unexpectly,
    which could crash that file.
    To fix it, let's do not allow F2FS_IOC_DE/COMPRESS_IOCTL if a file already
    has FI_COMPRESS_RELEASED flag.

    This is the reproduction process:
    1.  $ touch ./file
    2.  $ chattr +c ./file
    3.  $ dd if=/dev/random of=./file bs=4096 count=30 conv=notrunc
    4.  $ dd if=/dev/zero of=./file bs=4096 count=34 seek=30 conv=notrunc
    5.  $ sync
    6.  $ do_compress ./file      ; call F2FS_IOC_COMPRESS_FILE
    7.  $ get_compr_blocks ./file ; call F2FS_IOC_GET_COMPRESS_BLOCKS
    8.  $ release ./file          ; call F2FS_IOC_RELEASE_COMPRESS_BLOCKS
    9.  $ do_compress ./file      ; call F2FS_IOC_COMPRESS_FILE again
    10. $ get_compr_blocks ./file ; call F2FS_IOC_GET_COMPRESS_BLOCKS again

    This reproduction process is tested in 128kb cluster size.
    You can find compr_blocks has a negative value.

    f2fs: allow compression for mmap files in compress_mode=user

    [ Upstream commit 66d34fcbbe63ebd8584b792e0d741f6648100894 ]

    Since commit e3c548323d32 ("f2fs: let's allow compression for mmap files"),
    it has been allowed to compress mmap files. However, in compress_mode=user,
    it is not allowed yet. To keep the same concept in both compress_modes,
    f2fs_ioc_(de)compress_file() should also allow it.

    Let's remove checking mmap files in f2fs_ioc_(de)compress_file() so that
    the compression for mmap files is also allowed in compress_mode=user.

    x86/entry: Build thunk_$(BITS) only if CONFIG_PREEMPTION=y

    an empty object file.

    With some old versions of binutils (i.e., 2.35.90.20210113-1ubuntu1) the
    GNU assembler doesn't generate a symbol table for empty object files and
    objtool fails with the following error when a valid symbol table cannot
    be found:

      arch/x86/entry/thunk_64.o: warning: objtool: missing symbol table

    To prevent this from happening, build thunk_$(BITS).o only if

    sched/core: Do not requeue task on CPU excluded from cpus_mask

    [ Upstream commit 751d4cbc43879229dbc124afefe240b70fd29a85 ]

    The following warning was triggered on a large machine early in boot on
    a distribution kernel but the same problem should also affect mainline.

       WARNING: CPU: 439 PID: 10 at ../kernel/workqueue.c:2231 process_one_work+0x4d/0x440

        </TASK>

    Commit c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")
    optimises ttwu by queueing a task that is descheduling on the wakelist,
    but does not check if the task descheduling is still allowed to run on that CPU.

    In this warning, the problematic task is a workqueue rescue thread which
    checks if the rescue is for a per-cpu workqueue and running on the wrong CPU.
    While this is early in boot and it should be possible to create workers,
    the rescue thread may still used if the MAYDAY_INITIAL_TIMEOUT is reached
    or MAYDAY_INTERVAL and on a sufficiently large machine, the rescue
    thread is being used frequently.

    Tracing confirmed that the task should have migrated properly using the
    stopper thread to handle the migration. However, a parallel wakeup from udev
    running on another CPU that does not share CPU cache observes p->on_cpu and
    uses task_cpu(p), queues the task on the old CPU and triggers the warning.

    Check that the wakee task that is descheduling is still allowed to run
    on its current CPU and if not, wait for the descheduling to complete
    and select an allowed CPU.

    sched: Remove the limitation of WF_ON_CPU on wakelist if wakee cpu is idle

    [ Upstream commit f3dd3f674555bd9455c5ae7fafce0696bd9931b3 ]

    Wakelist can help avoid cache bouncing and offload the overhead of waker
    cpu. So far, using wakelist within the same llc only happens on
    WF_ON_CPU, and this limitation could be removed to further improve
    wakeup performance.

    The commit 518cd6234178 ("sched: Only queue remote wakeups when
    crossing cache boundaries") disabled queuing tasks on wakelist when
    the cpus share llc. This is because, at that time, the scheduler must
    send IPIs to do ttwu_queue_wakelist. Nowadays, ttwu_queue_wakelist also
    supports TIF_POLLING, so this is not a problem now when the wakee cpu is
    in idle polling.

    Benefits:
      Queuing the task on idle cpu can help improving performance on waker cpu
      and utilization on wakee cpu, and further improve locality because
      the wakee cpu can handle its own rq. This patch helps improving rt on
      our real java workloads where wakeup happens frequently.

      Consider the normal condition (CPU0 and CPU1 share same llc)
      Before this patch:

             CPU0                                       CPU1

        select_task_rq()                                idle
        rq_lock(CPU1->rq)
        enqueue_task(CPU1->rq)
        notify CPU1 (by sending IPI or CPU1 polling)

                                                        resched()

      After this patch:

             CPU0                                       CPU1

        add to wakelist of CPU1
        notify CPU1 (by sending IPI or CPU1 polling)

                                                        rq_lock(CPU1->rq)

                                                        resched()

      We see CPU0 can finish its work earlier. It only needs to put task to
      wakelist and return.
      While CPU1 is idle, so let itself handle its own runqueue data.

    This patch brings no difference about IPI.
      This patch only takes effect when the wakee cpu is:
      1) idle polling
      2) idle not polling

      For 1), there will be no IPI with or without this patch.

      For 2), there will always be an IPI before or after this patch.
      Before this patch: waker cpu will enqueue task and check preempt. Since
      "idle" will be sure to be preempted, waker cpu must send a resched IPI.
      After this patch: waker cpu will put the task to the wakelist of wakee
      cpu, and send an IPI.

    Our patch has improvement on schbench, hackbench
    and Pipe-based Context Switching of unixbench
    when there exists idle cpus,
    and no obvious regression on other tests of unixbench.
    This can help improve rt in scenes where wakeup happens frequently.

    sched: Fix the check of nr_running at queue wakelist

    [ Upstream commit 28156108fecb1f808b21d216e8ea8f0d205a530c ]

    The commit 2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it
    the wakee is descheduling") checked rq->nr_running <= 1 to avoid task
    stacking when WF_ON_CPU.

    Per the ordering of writes to p->on_rq and p->on_cpu, observing p->on_cpu
    (WF_ON_CPU) in ttwu_queue_cond() implies !p->on_rq, IOW p has gone through
    the deactivate_task() in __schedule(), thus p has been accounted out of
    rq->nr_running. As such, the task being the only runnable task on the rq
    implies reading rq->nr_running == 0 at that point.

    The benchmark result is in [1].

    video: fbdev: arkfb: Fix a divide-by-zero bug in ark_set_pixclock()

    [ Upstream commit 2f1c4523f7a3aaabe7e53d3ebd378292947e95c8 ]

    Since the user can control the arguments of the ioctl() from the user
    space, under special arguments that may result in a divide-by-zero bug
    in:
      drivers/video/fbdev/arkfb.c:784: ark_set_pixclock(info, (hdiv * info->var.pixclock) / hmul);
    with hdiv=1, pixclock=1 and hmul=2 you end up with (1*1)/2 = (int) 0.
    and then in:
      drivers/video/fbdev/arkfb.c:504: rv = dac_set_freq(par->dac, 0, 1000000000 / pixclock);
    we'll get a division-by-zero.

    The following log can reveal it:

    divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI

    x86/numa: Use cpumask_available instead of hardcoded NULL check

    [ Upstream commit 625395c4a0f4775e0fe00f616888d2e6c1ba49db ]

    GCC-12 started triggering a new warning:

      arch/x86/mm/numa.c: In function ‘cpumask_of_node’:
      arch/x86/mm/numa.c:916:39: warning: the comparison will always evaluate as ‘false’ for the address of ‘node_to_cpumask_map’ will never be NULL [-Waddress]

            |                                       ^~

    node_to_cpumask_map is of type cpumask_var_t[].

    When CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is set, cpumask_var_t is typedef'd to a
    pointer for dynamic allocation, else to an array of one element. The
    "wicked game" can be checked on line 700 of include/linux/cpumask.h.

    The original code in debug_cpumask_set_cpu() and cpumask_of_node() were
    probably written by the original authors with CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK=y
    (i.e. dynamic allocation) in mind, checking if the cpumask was available
    via a direct NULL check.

    When CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is not set, GCC gives the above warning
    while compiling the kernel.

    Fix that by using cpumask_available(), which does the NULL check when
    CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is set, otherwise returns true. Use it wherever
    such checks are made.

    Conditional definitions of cpumask_available() can be found along with
    the definition of cpumask_var_t. Check the cpumask.h reference mentioned
    above.

    sched, cpuset: Fix dl_cpu_busy() panic due to empty cs->cpus_allowed

    [ Upstream commit b6e8d40d43ae4dec00c8fea2593eeea3114b8f44 ]

    With cgroup v2, the cpuset's cpus_allowed mask can be empty indicating
    that the cpuset will just use the effective CPUs of its parent. So
    cpuset_can_attach() can call task_can_attach() with an empty mask.
    This can lead to cpumask_any_and() returns nr_cpu_ids causing the call
    to dl_bw_of() to crash due to percpu value access of an out of bound
    CPU value. For example:

    Fix that by using effective_cpus instead. For cgroup v1, effective_cpus
    is the same as cpus_allowed. For v2, effective_cpus is the real cpumask
    to be used by tasks within the cpuset anyway.

    Also update task_can_attach()'s 2nd argument name to cs_effective_cpus to
    reflect the change. In addition, a check is added to task_can_attach()
    to guard against the possibility that cpumask_any_and() may return a
    value >= nr_cpu_ids.

    failures, the sequel"), faddr2line is completely broken on arm64.

    For some reason, on arm64, the vmlinux ELF object file type is ET_DYN
    rather than ET_EXEC.  Check for both when determining whether the object
    is vmlinux.

    Modules and vmlinux.o have type ET_REL on all arches.

    powerpc/pci: Fix PHB numbering when using opal-phbid

    [ Upstream commit f4b39e88b42d13366b831270306326b5c20971ca ]

    The recent change to the PHB numbering logic has a logic error in the
    handling of "ibm,opal-phbid".

    When an "ibm,opal-phbid" property is present, &prop is written to and
    ret is set to zero.

    The following call to of_alias_get_id() is skipped because ret == 0.

    But then the if (ret >= 0) is true, and the body of that if statement
    sets prop = ret which throws away the value that was just read from
    "ibm,opal-phbid".

    Fix the logic by only doing the ret >= 0 check in the of_alias_get_id()
    case.

    kprobes: Forbid probing on trampoline and BPF code areas

    [ Upstream commit 28f6c37a2910f565b4f5960df52b2eccae28c891 ]

    kernel_text_address() treats ftrace_trampoline, kprobe_insn_slot
    and bpf_text_address as valid kprobe addresses - which is not ideal.

    These text areas are removable and changeable without any notification
    to kprobes, and probing on them can trigger unexpected behavior:

      https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/7/26/1148

    Considering that jump_label and static_call text are already
    forbiden to probe, kernel_text_address() should be replaced with
    core_kernel_text() and is_module_text_address() to check other text
    areas which are unsafe to kprobe.

    perf symbol: Fail to read phdr workaround

    [ Upstream commit 6d518ac7be6223811ab947897273b1bbef846180 ]

    The perf jvmti agent doesn't create program headers, in this case
    fallback on section headers as happened previously.

    Committer notes:

    To test this, from a public post by Ian:

    1) download a Java workload dacapo-9.12-MR1-bach.jar from
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/dacapobench/

    2) build perf such as "make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/perf NO_LIBBFD=1" it
    should detect Java and create /tmp/perf/libperf-jvmti.so

    3) run perf with the jvmti agent:

      perf record -k 1 java -agentpath:/tmp/perf/libperf-jvmti.so -jar dacapo-9.12-MR1-bach.jar -n 10 fop

    4) run perf inject:

      perf inject -i perf.data -o perf-injected.data -j

    5) run perf report

      perf report -i perf-injected.data | grep org.apache.fop

    With this patch reverted I see lots of symbols like:

         0.00%  java             jitted-388040-4656.so  [.] org.apache.fop.fo.FObj.bind(org.apache.fop.fo.PropertyList)

    With the patch (2d86612aacb7805f ("perf symbol: Correct address for bss
    symbols")) I see lots of:

    f2fs: fix to remove F2FS_COMPR_FL and tag F2FS_NOCOMP_FL at the same time

    [ Upstream commit 8ee236dcaa690d09ca612622e8bc8d09c302021d ]

    If the inode has the compress flag, it will fail to use
    'chattr -c +m' to remove its compress flag and tag no compress flag.
    However, the same command will be successful when executed again,
    as shown below:

      $ touch foo.txt
      $ chattr +c foo.txt
      $ chattr -c +m foo.txt
      chattr: Invalid argument while setting flags on foo.txt
      $ chattr -c +m foo.txt
      $ f2fs_io getflags foo.txt
      get a flag on foo.txt ret=0, flags=nocompression,inline_data

    Fix this by removing some checks in f2fs_setflags_common()
    that do not affect the original logic. I go through all the
    possible scenarios, and the results are as follows. Bold is
    the only thing that has changed.

    f2fs: change the current atomic write way

    [ Upstream commit 3db1de0e582c358dd013f3703cd55b5fe4076436 ]

    Current atomic write has three major issues like below.
     - keeps the updates in non-reclaimable memory space and they are even
       hard to be migrated, which is not good for contiguous memory
       allocation.
     - disk spaces used for atomic files cannot be garbage collected, so
       this makes it difficult for the filesystem to be defragmented.
     - If atomic write operations hit the threshold of either memory usage
       or garbage collection failure count, All the atomic write operations
       will fail immediately.

    To resolve the issues, I will keep a COW inode internally for all the
    updates to be flushed from memory, when we need to flush them out in a
    situation like high memory pressure. These COW inodes will be tagged
    as orphan inodes to be reclaimed in case of sudden power-cut or system
    failure during atomic writes.

    perf stat: Revert "perf stat: Add default hybrid events"

    [ Upstream commit ace3e31e653e79cae9b047e85f567e6b44c98532 ]

    This reverts commit Fixes: ac2dc29edd21f9ec ("perf stat: Add default
    hybrid events")

    Between this patch and the reverted patch, the commit 6c1912898ed21bef
    ("perf parse-events: Rename parse_events_error functions") and the
    commit 07eafd4e053a41d7 ("perf parse-event: Add init and exit to
    parse_event_error") clean up the parse_events_error_*() codes. The
    related change is also reverted.

    The reverted patch is hard to be extended to support new default events,
    e.g., Topdown events, and the existing "--detailed" option on a hybrid
    platform.

    A new solution will be proposed in the following patch to enable the
    perf stat default on a hybrid platform.

    powerpc/iommu: Fix iommu_table_in_use for a small default DMA window case

    [ Upstream commit d80f6de9d601c30b53c17f00cb7cfe3169f2ddad ]

    The existing iommu_table_in_use() helper checks if the kernel is using
    any of TCEs. There are some reserved TCEs:
    1) the very first one if DMA window starts from 0 to avoid having a zero
    but still valid DMA handle;
    2) it_reserved_start..it_reserved_end to exclude MMIO32 window in case
    the default window spans across that - this is the default for the first
    DMA window on PowerNV.

    When 1) is the case and 2) is not the helper does not skip 1) and returns
    wrong status.

    This only seems occurring when passing through a PCI device to a nested
    guest (not something we support really well) so it has not been seen
    before.

    This fixes the bug by adding a special case for no MMIO32 reservation.

    pseries/iommu/ddw: Fix kdump to work in absence of ibm,dma-window

    [ Upstream commit b1fc44eaa9ba31e28c4125d6b9205a3582b47b5d ]

    The pseries platform uses 32bit default DMA window (always 4K pages) and
    optional 64bit DMA window available via DDW ("Dynamic DMA Windows"),
    64K or 2M pages. For ages the default one was not removed and a huge
    window was created in addition. Things changed with SRIOV-enabled
    PowerVM which creates a default-and-bigger DMA window in 64bit space
    (still using 4K pages) for IOV VFs so certain OSes do not need to use
    the DDW API in order to utilize all available TCE budget.

    Linux on the other hand removes the default window and creates a bigger
    one (with more TCEs or/and a bigger page size - 64K/2M) in a bid to map
    the entire RAM, and if the new window size is smaller than that - it
    still uses this new bigger window. The result is that the default window
    is removed but the "ibm,dma-window" property is not.

    When kdump is invoked, the existing code tries reusing the existing 64bit
    DMA window which location and parameters are stored in the device tree but
    this fails as the new property does not make it to the kdump device tree
    blob. So the code falls back to the default window which does not exist
    anymore although the device tree says that it does. The result of that
    is that PCI devices become unusable and cannot be used for kdumping.

    This preserves the DMA64 and DIRECT64 properties in the device tree blob
    for the crash kernel. Since the crash kernel setup is done after device
    drivers are loaded and probed, the proper DMA config is stored at least
    for boot time devices.

    Because DDW window is optional and the code configures the default window
    first, the existing code creates an IOMMU table descriptor for
    the non-existing default DMA window. It is harmless for kdump as it does
    not touch the actual window (only reads what is mapped and marks those IO
    pages as used) but it is bad for kexec which clears it thinking it is
    a smaller default window rather than a bigger DDW window.

    This removes the "ibm,dma-window" property from the device tree after
    a bigger window is created and the crash kernel setup picks it up.

    powerpc/32s: Fix boot failure with KASAN + SMP + JUMP_LABEL_FEATURE_CHECK_DEBUG

    [ Upstream commit 6042a1652d643d1d34fa89bb314cb102960c0800 ]

    Since commit 4291d085b0b0 ("powerpc/32s: Make pte_update() non
    atomic on 603 core"), pte_update() has been using
    mmu_has_feature(MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE) to avoid a useless atomic
    operation on 603 cores.

    When kasan_early_init() sets up the early zero shadow, it uses
    __set_pte_at(). On book3s/32, __set_pte_at() calls pte_update()
    when CONFIG_SMP is selected in order to ensure the preservation of
    _PAGE_HASHPTE in case of concurrent update of the PTE. But that's
    too early for mmu_has_feature(), so when
    CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL_FEATURE_CHECK_DEBUG is selected, mmu_has_feature()
    calls printk(). That's too early to call printk() because KASAN
    early zero shadow page is not set up yet. It leads to a deadlock.

    However, when kasan_early_init() is called, there is only one CPU
    running and no risk of concurrent PTE update. So __set_pte_at() can
    be called with the 'percpu' flag. With that flag set, the PTE is
    written directly instead of being written via pte_update().

    powerpc/32: Call mmu_mark_initmem_nx() regardless of data block mapping.

    [ Upstream commit 980bbf7ca72012d317617fcdbfabe8708e4cef29 ]

    mark_initmem_nx() calls either mmu_mark_initmem_nx() or
    set_memory_attr() based on return from v_block_mapped()
    of _sinittext.

    But we can now handle text and data independently, so that
    text may be mapped by block even when data is mapped by pages.

    On the 8xx for instance, at startup 32Mbytes of memory are
    pinned in TLB. So the pinned entries need to go away for sinittext.

    In next patch a BAT will be set to also covers sinittext on book3s/32.
    So it will also be needed to call mmu_mark_initmem_nx() even when
    data above sinittext is not mapped with BATs.

    As this is highly dependent on the platform, call mmu_mark_initmem_nx()
    regardless of data block mapping. Then the platform will know what to
    do.

    Modify 8xx mmu_mark_initmem_nx() so that inittext mapping is modified
    only when pagealloc debug and kfence are not active, otherwise inittext
    is mapped with standard pages. And don't do anything on kernel text
    which is already mapped with PAGE_KERNEL_TEXT.

    fuse: Remove the control interface for virtio-fs

    The commit 15c8e72e88e0 ("fuse: allow skipping control interface and forced
    unmount") tries to remove the control interface for virtio-fs since it does
    not support aborting requests which are being processed. But it doesn't
    work now.

    This patch fixes it by skipping creating the control interface if
    fuse_conn->no_control is set.

    [ Upstream commit a91eb6803c1c715738682fece095145cbd68fe0b ]

    In qcom_iommu_has_secure_context(), we should call of_node_put()
    for the reference 'child' when breaking out of for_each_child_of_node()
    which will automatically increase and decrease the refcount.

    pointer unconditionally. As there is no user, drop it completely instead
    of calling it conditional.

    remoteproc: sysmon: Wait for SSCTL service to come up

    [ Upstream commit 47c04e00eff86a81cd357c3feed04c86089bcb85 ]

    The SSCTL service comes up after a finite time when the remote Q6 comes
    out of reset. Any graceful shutdowns requested during this period will
    be a NOP and abrupt tearing down of the glink channel might lead to pending
    transactions on the remote Q6 side and will ultimately lead to a fatal
    error. Fix this by waiting for the SSCTL service when a graceful shutdown
    is requested.

    proc: fix a dentry lock race between release_task and lookup

    Commit 7bc3e6e55acf06 ("proc: Use a list of inodes to flush from proc")
    moved proc_flush_task() behind __exit_signal().  Then, process systemd can
    take long period high cpu usage during releasing task in following
    concurrent processes:

      systemd                                 ps
    kernel_waitid                 stat(/proc/tgid)

                detach_pid
                  __change_pid // remove task->pid_links
                                         d_revalidate -> pid_revalidate  // 0
                                         d_invalidate(/proc/tgid)
                                           shrink_dcache_parent(/proc/tgid)
                                             d_walk(/proc/tgid)
                                               spin_lock_nested(/proc/tgid/fd)
                                               // iterating opened fd
            proc_flush_pid                                    |

                      shrink_lock_dentry(/proc/tgid/fd) --> race on dentry lock

    Function d_invalidate() will remove dentry from hash firstly, but why does
    proc_flush_pid() process dentry '/proc/tgid/fd' before dentry
    '/proc/tgid'?  That's because proc_pid_make_inode() adds proc inode in
    reverse order by invoking hlist_add_head_rcu().  But proc should not add
    any inodes under '/proc/tgid' except '/proc/tgid/task/pid', fix it by
    adding inode into 'pid->inodes' only if the inode is /proc/tgid or
    /proc/tgid/task/pid.

    Performance regression:
    Create 200 tasks, each task open one file for 50,000 times. Kill all
    tasks when opened files exceed 10,000,000 (cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr).

    Before fix:
    $ time killall -wq aa
      real    4m40.946s   # During this period, we can see 'ps' and 'systemd'
                            taking high cpu usage.

    After fix:
    $ time killall -wq aa
      real    1m20.732s   # During this period, we can see 'systemd' taking
                            high cpu usage.

    The kfifo_to_user() macro is supposed to return zero for success or
    negative error codes.  Unfortunately, there is a signedness bug so it
    returns unsigned int.  This only affects callers which try to save the
    result in ssize_t and as far as I can see the only place which does that
    is line6_hwdep_read().

    MIPS: Fixed __debug_virt_addr_valid()

    [ Upstream commit 8a2b456665d1e797123669581524cbb095fb003b ]

    It is permissible for kernel code to call virt_to_phys() against virtual
    addresses that are in KSEG0 or KSEG1 and we need to be dealing with both
    types. Rewrite the test condition to ensure that the kernel virtual
    addresses are above PAGE_OFFSET which they must be, and below KSEG2
    where the non-linear mapping starts.

    For EVA, there is not much that we can do given the linear address range
    that is offered, so just return any virtual address as being valid.

    Finally, when HIGHMEM is not enabled, all virtual addresses are assumed
    to be valid as well.

    ASoC: SOF: ipc3-topology: Prevent double freeing of ipc_control_data via load_bytes

    [ Upstream commit d5bd47f3ca124058a8e87eae4508afeda2132611 ]

    We have sanity checks for byte controls and if any of the fail the locally
    allocated scontrol->ipc_control_data is freed up, but not set to NULL.

    On a rollback path of the error the higher level code will also try to free
    the scontrol->ipc_control_data which will eventually going to lead to
    memory corruption as double freeing memory is not a good thing.

    serial: 8250_fsl: Don't report FE, PE and OE twice

    [ Upstream commit 9d3aaceb73acadf134596a2f8db9c451c1332d3d ]

    Some Freescale 8250 implementations have the problem that a single long
    break results in one irq per character frame time. The code in
    fsl8250_handle_irq() that is supposed to handle that uses the BI bit in
    lsr_saved_flags to detect such a situation and then skip the second
    received character. However it also stores other error bits and so after
    a single frame error the character received in the next irq handling is
    passed to the upper layer with a frame error, too.

    So after a spike on the data line (which is correctly recognized as a
    frame error) the following valid character is thrown away, because the
    driver reports a frame error for that one, too.

    To weaken this problem restrict saving LSR to only the BI bit.

    Note however that the handling is still broken:

     - lsr_saved_flags is updated using orig_lsr which is the LSR content
       for the first received char, but there might be more in the FIFO, so
       a character is thrown away that is received later and not necessarily
       the one following the break.
     - The doubled break might be the 2nd and 3rd char in the FIFO, so the
       workaround doesn't catch these, because serial8250_rx_chars() doesn't
       handle the workaround.
     - lsr_saved_flags might have set UART_LSR_BI at the entry of
       fsl8250_handle_irq() which doesn't originate from
       fsl8250_handle_irq()'s "up->lsr_saved_flags |= orig_lsr &
       UART_LSR_BI;" but from e.g. from serial8250_tx_empty().
     - For a long or a short break this isn't about two characters, but more
       or only a single one.

    vfio/ccw: Do not change FSM state in subchannel event

    [ Upstream commit cffcc109fd682075dee79bade3d60a07152a8fd1 ]

    The routine vfio_ccw_sch_event() is tasked with handling subchannel events,
    specifically machine checks, on behalf of vfio-ccw. It correctly calls
    cio_update_schib(), and if that fails (meaning the subchannel is gone)
    it makes an FSM event call to mark the subchannel Not Operational.

    If that worked, however, then it decides that if the FSM state was already
    Not Operational (implying the subchannel just came back), then it should
    simply change the FSM to partially- or fully-open.

    Remove this trickery, since a subchannel returning will require more
    probing than simply "oh all is well again" to ensure it works correctly.

    vfio/ccw: Fix FSM state if mdev probe fails

    [ Upstream commit f6c876d67e956de8d69349b0ee43bc7277c09e5c ]

    The FSM is in STANDBY state when arriving in vfio_ccw_mdev_probe(),
    and this routine converts it to IDLE as part of its processing.
    The error exit sets it to IDLE (again) but clears the private->mdev
    pointer.

    The FSM should of course be managing the state itself, but the
    correct thing for vfio_ccw_mdev_probe() to do would be to put
    the state back the way it found it.

    The corresponding check of private->mdev in vfio_ccw_sch_io_todo()
    can be removed, since the distinction is unnecessary at this point.

    Due to this deadlocks can happen as seen below while transmitting data,
    especially during ldisc congestion. Furthermore, the data channels starve
    the control channel on high transmission load on the ldisc.

    Introduce an additional control channel data queue to prevent timeouts and
    link hangups during ldisc congestion. This is being processed before the
    user channel data queue in gsm_data_kick(), i.e. with the highest priority.
    Put the queue to ldisc data path into a workqueue and trigger it whenever
    new data has been put into the transmission queue. Change
    gsm_dlci_data_sweep() accordingly to fill up the transmission queue until
    TX_THRESH_HI. This solves the locking issue, keeps latency low and provides
    good performance on high data load.
    Note that now all packets from a DLCI are removed from the internal queue
    if the associated DLCI was closed. This ensures that no data is sent by the
    introduced write task to an already closed DLCI.

    [ Upstream commit 32dd59f96924f45e33bc79854f7a00679c0fa28e ]

    The function may be used by the user directly and also by the n_gsm
    internal functions. They can lead into a race condition which results in
    interleaved frames if both are writing at the same time. The receiving side
    is not able to decode those interleaved frames correctly.

    Add a lock around the low side tty write to avoid race conditions and frame
    interleaving between user originated writes and n_gsm writes.

    tty: n_gsm: fix non flow control frames during mux flow off

    [ Upstream commit bec0224816d19abe4fe503586d16d51890540615 ]

    n_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
    See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
    The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
    the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.4.6.3.6 states that FCoff stops the
    transmission on all channels except the control channel. This is already
    implemented in gsm_data_kick(). However, chapter 5.4.8.1 explains that this
    shall result in the same behavior as software flow control on the ldisc in
    advanced option mode. That means only flow control frames shall be sent
    during flow off. The current implementation does not consider this case.

    Change gsm_data_kick() to send only flow control frames if constipated to
    abide the standard. gsm_read_ea_val() and gsm_is_flow_ctrl_msg() are
    introduced as helper functions for this.
    It is planned to use gsm_read_ea_val() in later code cleanups for other
    functions, too.

    The current implementation does not handle the situation that no data is in

    full.
    Add a timer that moves more data from user tty down to the internal queue

    tty: n_gsm: fix wrong queuing behavior in gsm_dlci_data_output()

    [ Upstream commit 556fc8ac06513cced381588d6d58c184d95cc4fe ]

    1) The function drains the fifo for the given user tty/DLCI without
    considering 'TX_THRESH_HI' and different to gsm_dlci_data_output_framed(),
    which moves only one packet from the user side to the internal transmission
    queue. We can only handle one packet at a time here if we want to allow
    DLCI priority handling in gsm_dlci_data_sweep() to avoid link starvation.
    2) Furthermore, the additional header octet from convergence layer type 2
    is not counted against MTU. It is part of the UI/UIH frame message which
    needs to be limited to MTU. Hence, it is wrong not to consider this octet.
    3) Finally, the waiting user tty is not informed about freed space in its
    send queue.

    Take at most one packet worth of data out of the DLCI fifo to fix 1).
    Limit the max user data size per packet to MTU - 1 in case of convergence
    layer type 2 to leave space for the control signal octet which is added in
    the later part of the function. This fixes 2).
    Add tty_port_tty_wakeup() to wake up the user tty if new write space has
    been made available to fix 3).

    tty: n_gsm: fix tty registration before control channel open

    [ Upstream commit 01aecd917114577c423f07cec0d186ad007d76fc ]

    The current implementation registers/deregisters the user ttys at mux
    attach/detach. That means that the user devices are available before any
    control channel is open. However, user channel initialization requires an
    open control channel. Furthermore, the user is not informed if the mux
    restarts due to configuration changes.
    Put the registration/deregistration procedure into separate function to
    improve readability.
    Move registration to mux activation and deregistration to mux cleanup to
    keep the user devices only open as long as a control channel exists. The
    user will be informed via the device driver if the mux was reconfigured in
    a way that required a mux re-activation.
    This makes it necessary to add T2 initialization to gsmld_open() for the
    ldisc open code path (not the reconfiguration code path) to avoid deletion
    of an uninitialized T2 at mux cleanup.

    tty: n_gsm: fix user open not possible at responder until initiator open

    [ Upstream commit ac77f0077c3265197d378158c85a55eee6d21508 ]

    After setting up the control channel on both sides the responder side may
    want to open a virtual tty to listen on until the initiator starts an
    application on a user channel. The current implementation allows the
    open() but no other operation, like termios. These fail with EINVAL.
    The responder sided application has no means to detect an open by the
    initiator sided application this way. And the initiator sided applications
    usually expect the responder sided application to listen on the user
    channel upon open.
    Set the user channel into half-open state on responder side once a user
    application opens the virtual tty to allow IO operations on it.
    Furthermore, keep the user channel constipated until the initiator side
    opens it to give the responder sided application the chance to detect the
    new connection and to avoid data loss if the responder sided application
    starts sending before the user channel is open.

    net/ice: fix initializing the bitmap in the switch code

    %ICE_MAX_FV_WORDS is 48, so bitmap_set() here was initializing only
    48 bits, leaving a junk in the rest 16.
    It was previously hidden due to that filling 48 bits makes
    bitmap_set() call external __bitmap_set(), but after making it use
    plain bit arithmetics on small bitmaps, compilers started seeing
    the issue. It was still working because those 16 weren't used
    anywhere anyhow.
    bitmap_{clear,set}() are not really intended to initialize bitmaps,
    rather to modify already initialized ones, as they don't do anything
    past the passed number of bits. The correct function to do this in
    that particular case is bitmap_fill(), so use it here. It will do
    `*possible_idx = ~0UL` instead of `*possible_idx |= GENMASK(47, 0)`,
    not leaving anything in an undefined state.

    net/mlx5: Expose mlx5_sriov_blocking_notifier_register / unregister APIs

    [ Upstream commit 846e437387e74c44ddc9f3eeec472fd37ca3cdb9 ]

    Expose mlx5_sriov_blocking_notifier_register / unregister APIs to let a
    VF register to be notified for its enablement / disablement by the PF.

    Upon VF probe it will call mlx5_sriov_blocking_notifier_register() with
    its notifier block and upon VF remove it will call
    mlx5_sriov_blocking_notifier_unregister() to drop its registration.

    This can give a VF the ability to clean some resources upon disable
    before that the command interface goes down and on the other hand sets
    some stuff before that it's enabled.

    This may be used by a VF which is migration capable in few cases.(e.g.
    PF load/unload upon an health recovery).

    Currently we do not check if SoundWire slave initialization timeout
    expired before continuing to access its registers.

    Its possible that the registers are not accessible if timeout is
    expired. Handle this by returning timeout in resume path.

    powerpc/perf: Optimize clearing the pending PMI and remove WARN_ON for PMI check in power_pmu_disable

    [ Upstream commit 890005a7d98f7452cfe86dcfb2aeeb7df01132ce ]

    commit 2c9ac51b850d ("powerpc/perf: Fix PMU callbacks to clear
    pending PMI before resetting an overflown PMC") added a new
    function "pmi_irq_pending" in hw_irq.h. This function is to check
    if there is a PMI marked as pending in Paca (PACA_IRQ_PMI).This is
    used in power_pmu_disable in a WARN_ON. The intention here is to
    provide a warning if there is PMI pending, but no counter is found
    overflown.

    During some of the perf runs, below warning is hit:

    This means that there is no PMC overflown among the active events
    in the PMU, but there is a PMU pending in Paca. The function
    "any_pmc_overflown" checks the PMCs on active events in
    cpuhw->n_events. Code snippet:

    <<>>
    if (any_pmc_overflown(cpuhw))
            clear_pmi_irq_pending();
     else
            WARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending());
    <<>>

    Here the PMC overflown is not from active event. Example: When we do
    perf record, default cycles and instructions will be running on PMC6
    and PMC5 respectively. It could happen that overflowed event is currently
    not active and pending PMI is for the inactive event. Debug logs from
    trace_printk:

    <<>>
    any_pmc_overflown: idx is 5: pmc value is 0xd9a
    power_pmu_disable: PMC1: 0x0, PMC2: 0x0, PMC3: 0x0, PMC4: 0x0, PMC5: 0xd9a, PMC6: 0x80002011
    <<>>

    Here active PMC (from idx) is PMC5 , but overflown PMC is PMC6(0x80002011).
    When we handle PMI interrupt for such cases, if the PMC overflown is
    from inactive event, it will be ignored. Reference commit:
    commit bc09c219b2e6 ("powerpc/perf: Fix finding overflowed PMC in interrupt")

    Patch addresses two changes:
    1) Fix 1 : Removal of warning ( WARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending()); )
       We were printing warning if no PMC is found overflown among active PMU
       events, but PMI pending in PACA. But this could happen in cases where
       PMC overflown is not in active PMC. An inactive event could have caused
       the overflow. Hence the warning is not needed. To know pending PMI is
       from an inactive event, we need to loop through all PMC's which will
       cause more SPR reads via mfspr and increase in context switch. Also in
       existing function: perf_event_interrupt, already we ignore PMI's
       overflown when it is from an inactive PMC.

    2) Fix 2: optimization in clearing pending PMI.
       Currently we check for any active PMC overflown before clearing PMI
       pending in Paca. This is causing additional SPR read also. From point 1,
       we know that if PMI pending in Paca from inactive cases, that is going
       to be ignored during replay. Hence if there is pending PMI in Paca, just
       clear it irrespective of PMC overflown or not.

    In summary, remove the any_pmc_overflown check entirely in
    power_pmu_disable. ie If there is a pending PMI in Paca, clear it, since
    we are in pmu_disable. There could be cases where PMI is pending because
    of inactive PMC ( which later when replayed also will get ignored ), so
    WARN_ON could give false warning. Hence removing it.

    profiling: fix shift too large makes kernel panic

    [ Upstream commit 0fe6ee8f123a4dfb529a5aff07536bb481f34043 ]

    2d186afd04d6 ("profiling: fix shift-out-of-bounds bugs") limits shift
    value by [0, BITS_PER_LONG -1], which means [0, 63].

    However, syzbot found that the max shift value should be the bit number of
    (_etext - _stext).  If shift is outside of this, the "buffer_bytes" will
    be zero and will cause kzalloc(0).  Then the kernel panics due to
    dereferencing the returned pointer 16.

    This can be easily reproduced by passing a large number like 60 to enable
    profiling and then run readprofile.

    selftests/livepatch: better synchronize test_klp_callbacks_busy

    [ Upstream commit 55eb9a6c8bf3e2099863118ef53e02d9f44f85a8 ]

    The test_klp_callbacks_busy module conditionally blocks a future
    livepatch transition by busy waiting inside its workqueue function,
    busymod_work_func().  After scheduling this work, a test livepatch is
    loaded, introducing the transition under test.

    Both events are marked in the kernel log for later verification, but
    there is no synchronization to ensure that busymod_work_func() logs its
    function entry message before subsequent selftest commands log their own
    messages.  This can lead to a rare test failure due to unexpected
    ordering like:

    #  --- expected
    #  +++ result
    #  @@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
    #   % modprobe test_klp_callbacks_busy block_transition=Y
    #   test_klp_callbacks_busy: test_klp_callbacks_busy_init
    #  -test_klp_callbacks_busy: busymod_work_func enter

    #   livepatch: 'test_klp_callbacks_demo': initializing patching transition
    #   test_klp_callbacks_demo: pre_patch_callback: vmlinux

    Force the module init function to wait until busymod_work_func() has
    started (and logged its message), before exiting to the next selftest
    steps.

    rpmsg: mtk_rpmsg: Fix circular locking dependency

    [ Upstream commit 353d9214682e65c55cdffad8c82139a3321c5f13 ]

    During execution of the worker that's used to register rpmsg devices
    we are safely locking the channels mutex but, when creating a new
    endpoint for such devices, we are registering a IPI on the SCP, which
    then makes the SCP to trigger an interrupt, lock its own mutex and in
    turn register more subdevices.
    This creates a circular locking dependency situation, as the mtk_rpmsg
    channels_lock will then depend on the SCP IPI lock.

    To solve this, simply unlock the channels_lock mutex before calling
    mtk_rpmsg_register_device() and relock it right after, as safety is
    still ensured by the locking mechanism that happens right after
    through SCP.

    serial: 8250: Export ICR access helpers for internal use

    [ Upstream commit cb5a40e3143bc64437858b337273fd63cc42e9c2 ]

    Make ICR access helpers available outside 8250_port.c, however retain
    them as ordinary static functions so as not to regress code generation.

    This is because `serial_icr_write' is currently automatically inlined by
    GCC, however `serial_icr_read' is not.  Making them both static inline
    would grow code produced, e.g.:

    $ i386-linux-gnu-size --format=gnu 8250_port-{old,new}.o
          text       data        bss      total filename
         15065       3378          0      18443 8250_port-old.o
         15289       3378          0      18667 8250_port-new.o

    and:

    $ riscv64-linux-gnu-size --format=gnu 8250_port-{old,new}.o
          text       data        bss      total filename
         16980       5306          0      22286 8250_port-old.o
         17124       5306          0      22430 8250_port-new.o

    while making them external would needlessly add a new module interface
    and lose the benefit from `serial_icr_write' getting inlined outside
    8250_port.o.

    ext4: recover csum seed of tmp_inode after migrating to extents

    [ Upstream commit 07ea7a617d6b278fb7acedb5cbe1a81ce2de7d0c ]

    When migrating to extents, the checksum seed of temporary inode
    need to be replaced by inode's, otherwise the inode checksums
    will be incorrect when swapping the inodes data.

    However, the temporary inode can not match it's checksum to
    itself since it has lost it's own checksum seed.

    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sdc
    mount /dev/sdc /mnt/sdc
    xfs_io -fc "pwrite 4k 4k" -c "fsync" /mnt/sdc/testfile
    chattr -e /mnt/sdc/testfile
    chattr +e /mnt/sdc/testfile
    umount /dev/sdc
    fsck -fn /dev/sdc

    ========
    ...
    Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
    Inode 13 passes checks, but checksum does not match inode.  Fix? no
    ...
    ========

    The fix is simple, save the checksum seed of temporary inode, and
    recover it after migrating to extents.

    jbd2: fix outstanding credits assert in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction()

    [ Upstream commit a89573ce4ad32f19f43ec669771726817e185be0 ]

    We catch an assert problem in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() when
    doing fsstress and request falut injection tests. The problem is
    happened in a race condition between jbd2_journal_commit_transaction()
    and ext4_end_io_end(). Firstly, ext4_writepages() writeback dirty pages
    and start reserved handle, and then the journal was aborted due to some
    previous metadata IO error, jbd2_journal_abort() start to commit current
    running transaction, the committing procedure could be raced by
    ext4_end_io_end() and lead to subtract j_reserved_credits twice from
    commit_transaction->t_outstanding_credits, finally the
    t_outstanding_credits is mistakenly smaller than t_nr_buffers and
    trigger assert.

     journal->j_running_transaction = NULL;
     J_ASSERT(t_nr_buffers <= t_outstanding_credits) //bomb!!!

    Fix this issue by using journal->j_state_lock to protect the subtraction
    in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction().

    nvme: define compat_ioctl again to unbreak 32-bit userspace.

    [ Upstream commit a25d4261582cf00dad884c194d21084836663d3d ]

    Commit 89b3d6e60550 ("nvme: simplify the compat ioctl handling") removed
    the initialization of compat_ioctl from the nvme block_device_operations
    structures.

    Presumably the expectation was that 32-bit ioctls would be directed
    through the regular handler but this is not the case: failing to assign
    .compat_ioctl actually means that the compat case is disabled entirely,
    and any attempt to submit nvme ioctls from 32-bit userspace fails
    outright with -ENOTTY.

    For example:

      % smartctl -x /dev/nvme0n1
      [...]
      Read NVMe Identify Controller failed: NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD: Inappropriate ioctl for device

    The blkdev_compat_ptr_ioctl helper can be used to direct compat calls
    through the main ioctl handler and makes things work again.

    nvme: use command_id instead of req->tag in trace_nvme_complete_rq()

    [ Upstream commit 679c54f2de672b7d79d02f8c4ad483ff6dd8ce2e ]

    Use command_id instead of req->tag in trace_nvme_complete_rq(),
    because of commit e7006de6c238 ("nvme: code command_id with a genctr
    for use authentication after release"), cmd->common.command_id is set to
    ((genctl & 0xf)< 12 | req->tag), no longer req->tag, which makes cid in
    trace_nvme_complete_rq and trace_nvme_setup_cmd are not the same.

    rtla: Fix Makefile when called from -C tools/

    [ Upstream commit c7d8a598c5b1e21a0957f5dec2ef4139d2d1a23a ]

    Sedat Dilek reported an error on rtla Makefile when running:

        $ make -C tools/ clean
        [...]
        make[2]: Entering directory
        '/home/dileks/src/linux-kernel/git/tools/tracing/rtla'
        [...]
        '/home/dileks/src/linux-kernel/git/Documentation/tools/rtla'
        /bin/sh: 1: test: rtla-make[2]:: unexpected operator    <------ The problem
        rm: cannot remove '/home/dileks/src/linux-kernel/git': Is a directory
        make[2]: *** [Makefile:120: clean] Error 1
        make[2]: Leaving directory

    This occurred because the rtla calls kernel's Makefile to get the
    version in silence mode, e.g.,

        $ make -sC ../../.. kernelversion
        5.19.0-rc4

    But the -s is being ignored when rtla's makefile is called indirectly,
    so the output looks like this:

        $ make -C ../../.. kernelversion
        make: Entering directory '/root/linux'
        5.19.0-rc4
        make: Leaving directory '/root/linux'

    Using 'grep -v make' avoids this problem, e.g.,

        $ make -C ../../.. kernelversion | grep -v make
        5.19.0-rc4

    Thus, add | grep -v make.

    since commit 4f74d2c8e827 ("vm: remove 'nr_accounted' calculations from

    android: binder: stop saving a pointer to the VMA

    [ Upstream commit a43cfc87caaf46710c8027a8c23b8a55f1078f19 ]

    Do not record a pointer to a VMA outside of the mmap_lock for later use.
    This is unsafe and there are a number of failure paths *after* the
    recorded VMA pointer may be freed during setup.  There is no callback to
    the driver to clear the saved pointer from generic mm code.  Furthermore,
    the VMA pointer may become stale if any number of VMA operations end up
    freeing the VMA so saving it was fragile to being with.

    Instead, change the binder_alloc struct to record the start address of the
    VMA and use vma_lookup() to get the vma when needed.  Add lockdep
    mmap_lock checks on updates to the vma pointer to ensure the lock is held
    and depend on that lock for synchronization of readers and writers - which
    was already the case anyways, so the smp_wmb()/smp_rmb() was not
    necessary.

    RDMA/srpt: Fix a use-after-free

    [ Upstream commit b5605148e6ce36bb21020d49010b617693933128 ]

    Change the LIO port members inside struct srpt_port from regular members

    platform/olpc: Fix uninitialized data in debugfs write

    [ Upstream commit 40ec787e1adf302c11668d4cc69838f4d584187d ]

    The call to:

            size = simple_write_to_buffer(cmdbuf, sizeof(cmdbuf), ppos, buf, size);

    will succeed if at least one byte is written to the "cmdbuf" buffer.
    The "*ppos" value controls which byte is written.  Another problem is
    that this code does not check for errors so it's possible for the entire
    buffer to be uninitialized.

    Inintialize the struct to zero to prevent reading uninitialized stack
    data.

    Debugfs is normally only writable by root so the impact of this bug is
    very minimal.

    - Prevent running remove routine in case of probing failure.
      Probing and removing are invoked by hotplug events raised upon line

    platform/x86: pmc_atom: Match all Lex BayTrail boards with critclk_systems DMI table

    [ Upstream commit c9d959fc32a5f9312282817052d8986614f2dc08 ]

    The critclk_systems[] DMI match table already contains 2 Lex BayTrail
    boards and patches were just submitted to add 3 more entries for the
    following models: 3I380NX, 3I380A, 3I380CW.

    Looking at: https://www.lex.com.tw/products/embedded-ipc-board/
    we can see that Lex BayTrail makes many embedded boards with
    multiple ethernet boards and none of their products are battery
    powered so we don't need to worry (too much) about power consumption
    when suspended.

    Add a new DMI match which simply matches all Lex BayTrail boards and drop
    the 2 existing board specific quirks.

    KVM: nVMX: Set UMIP bit CR4_FIXED1 MSR when emulating UMIP

    [ Upstream commit a910b5ab6b250a88fff1866bf708642d83317466 ]

    Make UMIP an "allowed-1" bit CR4_FIXED1 MSR when KVM is emulating UMIP.
    KVM emulates UMIP for both L1 and L2, and so should enumerate that L2 is
    allowed to have CR4.UMIP=1.  Not setting the bit doesn't immediately
    break nVMX, as KVM does set/clear the bit in CR4_FIXED1 in response to a
    guest CPUID update, i.e. KVM will correctly (dis)allow nested VM-Entry
    based on whether or not UMIP is exposed to L1.  That said, KVM should
    enumerate the bit as being allowed from time zero, e.g. userspace will
    see the wrong value if the MSR is read before CPUID is written.

    As part of Root Port interrupt handling, level-0 register is read first and
    based on the bits set in that, corresponding level-1 registers are read for
    further interrupt processing. Since both these values are currently read
    into the same 'val' variable, checking level-0 bits the second time around
    is happening on the 'val' variable value of level-1 register contents
    instead of freshly reading the level-0 value again.

    Fix by using different variables to store level-0 and level-1 registers

    RDMA/rxe: Fix rnr retry behavior

    [ Upstream commit 445fd4f4fb76d513de6b05b08b3a4d0bb980fc80 ]

    Currently the completer tasklet when retransmit timer or the rnr timer
    fires the same flag (qp->req.need_retry) is set so that if either timer
    fires it will attempt to perform a retry flow on the send queue.  This has
    the effect of responding to an RNR NAK at the first retransmit timer event
    which might not allow the requested rnr timeout.

    This patch adds a new flag (qp->req.wait_for_rnr_timer) which, if set,
    prevents a retry flow until the rnr nak timer fires.

    This patch fixes rnr retry errors which can be observed by running the
    pyverbs test_rdmacm_async_traffic_external_qp multiple times. With this
    patch applied they do not occur.

    compare with the mr->lkey.

    int or a s64 value.

    Current code incorrectly uses the fixed size utils.read_u64() to
    read the field 'counter' inside atomic_long_t.

    On 32 bits architectures reading the last element 'tail_id' of the
    struct prb_desc_ring:
            struct prb_desc_ring {
                    ...
                    atomic_long_t tail_id;
            };
    causes the utils.read_u64() to access outside the boundary of the
    struct and the gdb command 'lx-dmesg' exits with error:
            Python Exception <class 'IndexError'>: index out of range
            Error occurred in Python: index out of range

    Query the really used atomic_long_t counter type size.

    gpio: gpiolib-of: Fix refcount bugs in of_mm_gpiochip_add_data()

    [ Upstream commit 5d07a692f9562f9c06e62cce369e9dd108173a0f ]

    We should use of_node_get() when a new reference of device_node
    is created. It is noted that the old reference stored in
    'mm_gc->gc.of_node' should also be decreased.

    This patch is based on the fact that there is a call site in function
    'qe_add_gpiochips()' of src file 'drivers\soc\fsl\qe\gpio.c'. In this
    function, of_mm_gpiochip_add_data() is contained in an iteration of
    for_each_compatible_node() which will automatically increase and
    decrease the refcount. So we need additional of_node_get() for the
    reference escape in of_mm_gpiochip_add_data().

    During a destroy CQ an interrupt may cause processing of a CQE after CQ
    resources are freed by irdma_cq_free_rsrc(). Fix this by moving the call
    to irdma_cq_free_rsrc() after the irdma_sc_cleanup_ceqes(), which is
    called under the cq_lock.

    [ Upstream commit fd7d47484125c7d04578de9294faa7fec6e5df0a ]

    When the OTG port is fixed to host mode, the driver does not request its
    IRQs, nor does it enable those IRQs in hardware. Similarly, the driver
    should ignore the OTG port IRQs when handling the shared interrupt.

    Otherwise, it would update the extcon based on an ID pin which may be in
    an undefined state, or try to queue a uninitialized work item.

    usb: dwc3: core: Do not perform GCTL_CORE_SOFTRESET during bootup

    [ Upstream commit 07903626d98853e605fe63e5ce149f1b7314bbea ]

    According to the programming guide, it is recommended to
    perform a GCTL_CORE_SOFTRESET only when switching the mode
    from device to host or host to device. However, it is found
    that during bootup when __dwc3_set_mode() is called for the
    first time, GCTL_CORESOFTRESET is done with suspendable bit(BIT 17)
    of DWC3_GUSB3PIPECTL set. This some times leads to issues
    like controller going into bad state and controller registers
    reading value zero. Until GCTL_CORESOFTRESET is done and
    run/stop bit is set core initialization is not complete.
    Setting suspendable bit of DWC3_GUSB3PIPECTL and then
    performing GCTL_CORESOFTRESET is therefore not recommended.
    Avoid this by only performing the reset if current_dr_role is set,
    that is, when doing subsequent role switching.

    scsi: smartpqi: Fix DMA direction for RAID requests

    [ Upstream commit 69695aeaa6621bc49cdd7a8e5a8d1042461e496e ]

    Correct a SOP READ and WRITE DMA flags for some requests.

    This update corrects DMA direction issues with SCSI commands removed from
    the controller's internal lookup table.

    Currently, SCSI READ BLOCK LIMITS (0x5) was removed from the controller
    lookup table and exposed a DMA direction flag issue.

    SCSI READ BLOCK LIMITS was recently removed from our controller lookup
    table so the controller uses the respective IU flag field to set the DMA
    data direction. Since the DMA direction is incorrect the FW never completes
    the request causing a hang.

    Some SCSI commands which use SCSI READ BLOCK LIMITS

          * sg_map
          * mt -f /dev/stX status

    After updating controller firmware, users may notice their tape units
    failing. This patch resolves the issue.

    Also, the AIO path DMA direction is correct.

    The DMA direction flag is a day-one bug with no reported BZ.

    PCI: qcom: Set up rev 2.1.0 PARF_PHY before enabling clocks

    [ Upstream commit 38f897ae3d44900f627cad708a15db498ce2ca31 ]

    We currently enable clocks BEFORE we write to PARF_PHY_CTRL reg to enable
    clocks and resets. This causes the driver to never set to a ready state
    with the error 'Phy link never came up'.

    This is caused by the PHY clock getting enabled before setting the required
    bits in the PARF regs.

    A workaround for this was set but with this new discovery we can drop
    the workaround and use a proper solution to the problem by just enabling
    the clock only AFTER the PARF_PHY_CTRL bit is set.

    This correctly sets up the PCIe link and makes it usable even when a
    bootloader leaves the PCIe link in an undefined state.

    PCI/portdrv: Don't disable AER reporting in get_port_device_capability()

    [ Upstream commit 8795e182b02dc87e343c79e73af6b8b7f9c5e635 ]

    AER reporting is currently disabled in the DevCtl registers of all non Root
    Port PCIe devices on systems using pcie_ports_native || host->native_aer,
    disabling AER completely in such systems. This is because 2bd50dd800b5
    ("PCI: PCIe: Disable PCIe port services during port initialization"), added
    a call to pci_disable_pcie_error_reporting() *after* the AER setup was
    completed for the PCIe device tree.

    Here a longer analysis about the current status of AER enabling /
    disabling upon bootup provided by Bjorn:

      pcie_portdrv_probe
        pcie_port_device_register
          get_port_device_capability
            pci_disable_pcie_error_reporting
              clear CERE NFERE FERE URRE               # <-- disable for RP USP DSP
          pcie_device_init
            device_register                            # new AER service device
              aer_probe
                aer_enable_rootport                    # RP only
                  set_downstream_devices_error_reporting
                    set_device_error_reporting         # self (RP)
                      if (RP || USP || DSP)
                        pci_enable_pcie_error_reporting
                          set CERE NFERE FERE URRE     # <-- enable for RP
                    pci_walk_bus
                      set_device_error_reporting
                        if (RP || USP || DSP)
                          pci_enable_pcie_error_reporting
                            set CERE NFERE FERE URRE   # <-- enable for USP DSP

    In a typical Root Port -> Endpoint hierarchy, the above:
      - Disables Error Reporting for the Root Port,
      - Enables Error Reporting for the Root Port,
      - Does NOT enable Error Reporting for the Endpoint because it is not a
        Root Port or Switch Port.

    In a deeper Root Port -> Upstream Switch Port -> Downstream Switch
    Port -> Endpoint hierarchy:
      - Disables Error Reporting for the Root Port,
      - Enables Error Reporting for the Root Port,
      - Enables Error Reporting for both Switch Ports,
      - Does NOT enable Error Reporting for the Endpoint because it is not a
        Root Port or Switch Port,
      - Disables Error Reporting for the Switch Ports when pcie_portdrv_probe()
        claims them.  AER does not re-enable it because these are not Root
        Ports.

    Remove this call to pci_disable_pcie_error_reporting() from
    get_port_device_capability(), leaving the already enabled AER configuration
    intact. With this change, AER is enabled in the Root Port and the PCIe
    switch upstream and downstream ports. Only the PCIe Endpoints don't have
    AER enabled yet. A follow-up patch will take care of this Endpoint
    enabling.

    KVM: s390: pv: leak the topmost page table when destroy fails

    [ Upstream commit faa2f72cb3569256480c5540d242c84e99965160 ]

    Each secure guest must have a unique ASCE (address space control
    element); we must avoid that new guests use the same page for their
    ASCE, to avoid errors.

    Since the ASCE mostly consists of the address of the topmost page table
    (plus some flags), we must not return that memory to the pool unless
    the ASCE is no longer in use.

    Only a successful Destroy Secure Configuration UVC will make the ASCE
    reusable again.

    If the Destroy Configuration UVC fails, the ASCE cannot be reused for a
    secure guest (either for the ASCE or for other memory areas). To avoid
    a collision, it must not be used again. This is a permanent error and
    the page becomes in practice unusable, so we set it aside and leak it.
    On failure we already leak other memory that belongs to the ultravisor
    (i.e. the variable and base storage for a guest) and not leaking the
    topmost page table was an oversight.

    This error (and thus the leakage) should not happen unless the hardware
    is broken or KVM has some unknown serious bug.

    Some functions of the bitmap API take advantage of the fact that a bitmap

    So, to make sure this assertion is correct, allocate bitmaps with

    staging: rtl8192u: Fix sleep in atomic context bug in dm_fsync_timer_callback

    [ Upstream commit 6a0c054930d554ad8f8044ef1fc856d9da391c81 ]

    There are sleep in atomic context bugs when dm_fsync_timer_callback is
    executing. The root cause is that the memory allocation functions with
    GFP_KERNEL or GFP_NOIO parameters are called in dm_fsync_timer_callback
    which is a timer handler. The call paths that could trigger bugs are
    shown below:

        (interrupt context)
    dm_fsync_timer_callback
      write_nic_byte
        kzalloc(sizeof(data), GFP_KERNEL); //may sleep
        usb_control_msg
          kmalloc(.., GFP_NOIO); //may sleep
      write_nic_dword
        kzalloc(sizeof(data), GFP_KERNEL); //may sleep
        usb_control_msg
          kmalloc(.., GFP_NOIO); //may sleep

    This patch uses delayed work to replace timer and moves the operations
    that may sleep into the delayed work in order to mitigate bugs.

    binder: fix redefinition of seq_file attributes

    [ Upstream commit b7e241bbff24f9e106bf616408fd58bcedc44bae ]

    The patchset in [1] exported some definitions to binder_internal.h in
    order to make the debugfs entries such as 'stats' and 'transaction_log'
    available in a binderfs instance. However, the DEFINE_SHOW_ATTRIBUTE
    macro expands into a static function/variable pair, which in turn get
    redefined each time a source file includes this internal header.

    This problem was made evident after a report from the kernel test robot
    <lkp@intel.com> where several W=1 build warnings are seen in downstream
    kernels. See the following example:

      include/../drivers/android/binder_internal.h:111:23: warning: 'binder_stats_fops' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
         111 | DEFINE_SHOW_ATTRIBUTE(binder_stats);
             |                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~
      include/linux/seq_file.h:174:37: note: in definition of macro 'DEFINE_SHOW_ATTRIBUTE'
         174 | static const struct file_operations __name ## _fops = {                 \
             |                                     ^~~~~~

    This patch fixes the above issues by moving back the definitions into
    binder.c and instead creates an array of the debugfs entries which is
    more convenient to share with binderfs and iterate through.

    PCI: endpoint: Don't stop controller when unbinding endpoint function

    Unbinding an endpoint function from the endpoint controller shouldn't stop

    dmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread support for a DMA channel

    [ Upstream commit b2cc5c465c2cb8ab697c3fd6583c614e3f6cfbcc ]

    When we get a DMA channel and try to use it in multiple threads it
    will cause oops and hanging the system.

    This happens because of data race. Each thread rewrite channels's
    descriptor as soon as device_prep_dma_memcpy() is called. It leads to the
    situation when the driver thinks that it uses right descriptor that
    actually is freed or substituted for other one.

    With current fixes a descriptor changes its value only when it has
    been used. A new descriptor is acquired from vc->desc_issued queue that
    is already filled with descriptors that are ready to be sent. Threads
    have no direct access to DMA channel descriptor. Now it is just possible
    to queue a descriptor for further processing.

    KVM: arm64: Don't return from void function

    [ Upstream commit 1c3ace2b8b3995d3213c5e2d2aca01a0577a3b0f ]

    Although harmless, the return statement in kvm_unexpected_el2_exception
    is rather confusing as the function itself has a void return type. The
    C standard is also pretty clear that "A return statement with an
    expression shall not appear in a function whose return type is void".
    Given that this return statement does not seem to add any actual value,
    let's not pointlessly violate the standard.

    Build-tested with GCC 10 and CLANG 13 for good measure, the disassembled
    code is identical with or without the return statement.

    soundwire: revisit driver bind/unbind and callbacks

    [ Upstream commit bd29c00edd0a5dac8b6e7332bb470cd50f92e893 ]

    In the SoundWire probe, we store a pointer from the driver ops into
    the 'slave' structure. This can lead to kernel oopses when unbinding
    codec drivers, e.g. with the following sequence to remove machine
    driver and codec driver.

    /sbin/modprobe -r snd_soc_sof_sdw
    /sbin/modprobe -r snd_soc_rt711

    The full details can be found in the BugLink below, for reference the
    two following examples show different cases of driver ops/callbacks
    being invoked after the driver .remove().

    kernel:  ? dpm_sysfs_remove+0x60/0x60

    This was not detected earlier in Intel tests since the tests first
    remove the parent PCI device and shut down the bus. The sequence
    above is a corner case which keeps the bus operational but without a
    driver bound.

    While trying to solve this kernel oopses, it became clear that the
    existing SoundWire bus does not deal well with the unbind case.

    Commit 528be501b7d4a ("soundwire: sdw_slave: add probe_complete structure and new fields")
    added a 'probed' status variable and a 'probe_complete'
    struct completion. This status is however not reset on remove and
    likewise the 'probe complete' is not re-initialized, so the
    bind/unbind/bind test cases would fail. The timeout used before the
    'update_status' callback was also a bad idea in hindsight, there
    should really be no timing assumption as to if and when a driver is
    bound to a device.

    An initial draft was based on device_lock() and device_unlock() was
    tested. This proved too complicated, with deadlocks created during the
    suspend-resume sequences, which also use the same device_lock/unlock()
    as the bind/unbind sequences. On a CometLake device, a bad DSDT/BIOS
    caused spurious resumes and the use of device_lock() caused hangs
    during suspend. After multiple weeks or testing and painful
    reverse-engineering of deadlocks on different devices, we looked for
    alternatives that did not interfere with the device core.

    A bus notifier was used successfully to keep track of DRIVER_BOUND and
    DRIVER_UNBIND events. This solved the bind-unbind-bind case in tests,
    but it can still be defeated with a theoretical corner case where the
    memory is freed by a .remove while the callback is in use. The
    notifier only helps make sure the driver callbacks are valid, but not
    that the memory allocated in probe remains valid while the callbacks
    are invoked.

    This patch suggests the introduction of a new 'sdw_dev_lock' mutex
    protecting probe/remove and all driver callbacks. Since this mutex is
    'local' to SoundWire only, it does not interfere with existing locks
    and does not create deadlocks. In addition, this patch removes the
    'probe_complete' completion, instead we directly invoke the
    'update_status' from the probe routine. That removes any sort of
    timing dependency and a much better support for the device/driver
    model, the driver could be bound before the bus started, or eons after
    the bus started and the hardware would be properly initialized in all
    cases.

    soundwire: bus_type: fix remove and shutdown support

    [ Upstream commit df6407782964dc7e35ad84230abb38f46314b245 ]

    The bus sdw_drv_remove() and sdw_drv_shutdown() helpers are used
    conditionally, if the driver provides these routines.

    These helpers already test if the driver provides a .remove or
    .shutdown callback, so there's no harm in invoking the
    sdw_drv_remove() and sdw_drv_shutdown() unconditionally.

    In addition, the current code is imbalanced with
    dev_pm_domain_attach() called from sdw_drv_probe(), but
    dev_pm_domain_detach() called from sdw_drv_remove() only if the driver
    provides a .remove callback.

    It's logically correct to undo everything that was done when an error is

    controller will be left in an undetermined state. Since the link is set up
    in the host_init method, deactivate it there in the cleanup-on-error block
    and stop the link in the antagonistic routine - dw_pcie_host_deinit(). Link
    deactivation is platform-specific and should be implemented in

    kasan: fix zeroing vmalloc memory with HW_TAGS

    [ Upstream commit 6c2f761dad7851d8088b91063ccaea3c970efe78 ]

    HW_TAGS KASAN skips zeroing page_alloc allocations backing vmalloc
    mappings via __GFP_SKIP_ZERO.  Instead, these pages are zeroed via
    kasan_unpoison_vmalloc() by passing the KASAN_VMALLOC_INIT flag.

    The problem is that __kasan_unpoison_vmalloc() does not zero pages when
    either kasan_vmalloc_enabled() or is_vmalloc_or_module_addr() fail.

    Thus:

    1. Change __vmalloc_node_range() to only set KASAN_VMALLOC_INIT when
       __GFP_SKIP_ZERO is set.

    2. Change __kasan_unpoison_vmalloc() to always zero pages when the
       KASAN_VMALLOC_INIT flag is set.

    3. Add WARN_ON() asserts to check that KASAN_VMALLOC_INIT cannot be set
       in other early return paths of __kasan_unpoison_vmalloc().

    Also clean up the comment in __kasan_unpoison_vmalloc.

    mm/migration: fix potential pte_unmap on an not mapped pte

    [ Upstream commit ad1ac596e8a8c4b06715dfbd89853eb73c9886b2 ]

    __migration_entry_wait and migration_entry_wait_on_locked assume pte is
    always mapped from caller.  But this is not the case when it's called from
    migration_entry_wait_huge and follow_huge_pmd.  Add a hugetlbfs variant

    mm/migration: return errno when isolate_huge_page failed

    [ Upstream commit 7ce82f4c3f3ead13a9d9498768e3b1a79975c4d8 ]

    We might fail to isolate huge page due to e.g.  the page is under
    migration which cleared HPageMigratable.  We should return errno in this
    case rather than always return 1 which could confuse the user, i.e.  the
    caller might think all of the memory is migrated while the hugetlb page is
    left behind.  We make the prototype of isolate_huge_page consistent with
    isolate_lru_page as suggested by Huang Ying and rename isolate_huge_page
    to isolate_hugetlb as suggested by Muchun to improve the readability.

    RDMA/rxe: Fix deadlock in rxe_do_local_ops()

    [ Upstream commit 7cb33d1bc1ac8e51fd88928f96674d392f8e07c4 ]

    When a local operation (invalidate mr, reg mr, bind mw) is finished there
    will be no ack packet coming from a responder to cause the wqe to be
    completed. This may happen anyway if a subsequent wqe performs
    IO. Currently if the wqe is signalled the completer tasklet is scheduled
    immediately but not otherwise.

    This leads to a deadlock if the next wqe has the fence bit set in send
    flags and the operation is not signalled. This patch removes the condition
    that the wqe must be signalled in order to schedule the completer tasklet
    which is the simplest fix for this deadlock and is fairly low cost. This
    is the analog for local operations of always setting the ackreq bit in all
    last or only request packets even if the operation is not signalled.

    coresight: syscfg: Update load and unload operations

    [ Upstream commit 8add26f7ef33bba7984cb6ff7911c6aa970fe55a ]

    The configfs system is a source of access to the config information in the
    configuration and feature lists.

    This can result in additional LOCKDEP issues as a result of the mutex
    ordering between the config list mutex (cscfg_mutex) and the configfs
    system mutexes.

    As such we need to adjust how load/unload operations work to ensure correct
    operation.

    1) Previously the cscfg_mutex was held throughout the load/unload
    operation. This is now only held during configuration list manipulations,
    resulting in a multi-stage load/unload process.

    2) All operations that manipulate the configfs representation of the
    configurations and features are now separated out and run without the
    cscfg_mutex being held. This avoids circular lock_dep issue with the
    built-in configfs mutexes and semaphores

    3) As the load and unload is now multi-stage, some parts under the
    cscfg_mutex and others not:
    i) A flag indicating a load / unload operation in progress is used to
    serialise load / unload operations.
    ii) activating any configuration not possible when unload is in progress.
    iii) Configurations have an "available" flag set only after the last load
    stage for the configuration is complete. Activation of the configuration
    not possible till flag is set.

    4) Following load/unload rules remain:
    i) Unload prevented while any configuration is active remains.
    ii) Unload in strict reverse order of load.
    iii) Existing configurations can be activated while a new load operation
    is underway. (by definition there can be no dependencies between an
    existing configuration and a new loading one due to ii) above.)

    coresight: configfs: Fix unload of configurations on module exit

    [ Upstream commit 199380decc5f9188a9e65676031950f1734aaffe ]

    Any loaded configurations must be correctly unloaded on coresight module
    exit, or issues can arise with nested locking in the configfs directory
    code if built with CONFIG_LOCKDEP.

    Prior to this patch, the preloaded configuration configfs directory entries
    were being unloaded by the recursive code in
    configfs_unregister_subsystem().

    However, when built with CONFIG_LOCKDEP, this caused a nested lock warning,
    which was not mitigated by the LOCKDEP dependent code in fs/configfs/dir.c
    designed to prevent this, due to the different directory levels for the
    root of the directory being removed.

    As the preloaded (and all other) configurations are registered after
    configfs_register_subsystem(), we now explicitly unload them before the
    call to configfs_unregister_subsystem().

    The new routine cscfg_unload_cfgs_on_exit() iterates through the load
    owner list to unload any remaining configurations that were not unloaded
    by the user before the module exits. This covers both the
    CSCFG_OWNER_PRELOAD and CSCFG_OWNER_MODULE owner types, and will be
    extended to cover future load owner types for CoreSight configurations.

    driver core: fix potential deadlock in __driver_attach

    [ Upstream commit 70fe758352cafdee72a7b13bf9db065f9613ced8 ]

    In __driver_attach function, There are also AA deadlock problem,
    like the commit b232b02bf3c2 ("driver core: fix deadlock in
    __device_attach").

    stack like commit b232b02bf3c2 ("driver core: fix deadlock in
    __device_attach").
    list below:
        In __driver_attach function, The lock holding logic is as follows:
        ...
        __driver_attach
        if (driver_allows_async_probing(drv))
          device_lock(dev)      // get lock dev
            async_schedule_dev(__driver_attach_async_helper, dev); // func
              async_schedule_node
                async_schedule_node_domain(func)
                  entry = kzalloc(sizeof(struct async_entry), GFP_ATOMIC);
                  /* when fail or work limit, sync to execute func, but
                     __driver_attach_async_helper will get lock dev as
                     will, which will lead to A-A deadlock.  */
                  if (!entry || atomic_read(&entry_count) > MAX_WORK) {
                    func;
                  else
                    queue_work_node(node, system_unbound_wq, &entry->work)
          device_unlock(dev)

        As above show, when it is allowed to do async probes, because of
        out of memory or work limit, async work is not be allowed, to do
        sync execute instead. it will lead to A-A deadlock because of
        __driver_attach_async_helper getting lock dev.

    Reproduce:
    and it can be reproduce by make the condition
    (if (!entry || atomic_read(&entry_count) > MAX_WORK)) untenable, like
    below:

    To fix the deadlock, move the async_schedule_dev outside device_lock,
    as we can see, in async_schedule_node_domain, the parameter of
    queue_work_node is system_unbound_wq, so it can accept concurrent
    operations. which will also not change the code logic, and will
    not lead to deadlock.

    dmaengine: dw-edma: Fix eDMA Rd/Wr-channels and DMA-direction semantics

    [ Upstream commit c1e33979171da63cf47e56243ccb8ba82363c7d3 ]

    In accordance with [1, 2] the DW eDMA controller has been created to be
    part of the DW PCIe Root Port and DW PCIe End-point controllers and to
    offload the transferring of large blocks of data between application and
    remote PCIe domains leaving the system CPU free for other tasks. In the
    first case (eDMA being part of DW PCIe Root Port) the eDMA controller is
    always accessible via the CPU DBI interface and never over the PCIe wire.

    The latter case is more complex. Depending on the DW PCIe End-Point IP-core
    synthesize parameters it's possible to have the eDMA registers accessible
    not only from the application CPU side, but also via mapping the eDMA CSRs
    over a dedicated endpoint BAR. So based on the specifics denoted above the
    eDMA driver is supposed to support two types of the DMA controller setups:

      1) eDMA embedded into the DW PCIe Root Port/End-point and accessible over
         the local CPU from the application side.

      2) eDMA embedded into the DW PCIe End-point and accessible via the PCIe
         wire with MWr/MRd TLPs generated by the CPU PCIe host controller.

    Since the CPU memory resides different sides in these cases the semantics
    of the MEM_TO_DEV and DEV_TO_MEM operations is flipped with respect to the
    Tx and Rx DMA channels. So MEM_TO_DEV/DEV_TO_MEM corresponds to the Tx/Rx
    channels in setup 1) and to the Rx/Tx channels in case of setup 2).

    The DW eDMA driver has supported the case 2) since e63d79d1ffcd
    ("dmaengine: Add Synopsys eDMA IP core driver") in the framework of the
    drivers/dma/dw-edma/dw-edma-pcie.c driver.

    The case 1) support was added later by bd96f1b2f43a ("dmaengine: dw-edma:
    support local dma device transfer semantics").  Afterwards the driver was
    supposed to cover the both possible eDMA setups, but the latter commit
    turned out to be not fully correct.

    The problem was that the commit together with the new functionality support
    also changed the channel direction semantics so the eDMA Read-channel
    (corresponding to the DMA_DEV_TO_MEM direction for case 1) now uses the
    sgl/cyclic base addresses as the Source addresses of the DMA transfers and
    dma_slave_config.dst_addr as the Destination address of the DMA transfers.

    Similarly the eDMA Write-channel (corresponding to the DMA_MEM_TO_DEV
    direction for case 1) now uses dma_slave_config.src_addr as a source
    address of the DMA transfers and sgl/cyclic base address as the Destination
    address of the DMA transfers. This contradicts the logic of the
    DMA-interface, which implies that DEV side is supposed to belong to the
    PCIe device memory and MEM - to the CPU/Application memory. Indeed it seems
    irrational to have the SG-list defined in the PCIe bus space, while
    expecting a contiguous buffer allocated in the CPU memory. Moreover the
    passed SG-list and cyclic DMA buffers are supposed to be mapped in a way so
    to be seen by the DW eDMA Application (CPU) interface.

    So in order to have the correct DW eDMA interface we need to invert the
    eDMA Rd/Wr-channels and DMA-slave directions semantics by selecting the
    src/dst addresses based on the DMA transfer direction instead of using the
    channel direction capability.

    scsi: iscsi: Fix session removal on shutdown

    [ Upstream commit 31500e902759322ba3c64b60dabae2704e738df8 ]

    When the system is shutting down, iscsid is not running so we will not get
    a response to the ISCSI_ERR_INVALID_HOST error event. The system shutdown
    will then hang waiting on userspace to remove the session.

    This has libiscsi force the destruction of the session from the kernel when
    iscsi_host_remove() is called from a driver's shutdown callout.

    This fixes a regression added in qedi boot with commit d1f2ce77638d ("scsi:
    qedi: Fix host removal with running sessions") which made qedi use the
    common session removal function that waits on userspace instead of rolling
    its own kernel based removal.

    scsi: iscsi: Add helper to remove a session from the kernel

    [ Upstream commit bb42856bfd54fda1cbc7c470fcf5db1596938f4f ]

    During qedi shutdown we need to stop the iSCSI layer from sending new nops
    as pings and from responding to target ones and make sure there is no
    running connection cleanups. Commit d1f2ce77638d ("scsi: qedi: Fix host
    removal with running sessions") converted the driver to use the libicsi
    helper to drive session removal, so the above issues could be handled. The
    problem is that during system shutdown iscsid will not be running so when
    we try to remove the root session we will hang waiting for userspace to
    reply.

    Add a helper that will drive the destruction of sessions like these during
    system shutdown.

    mwifiex: fix sleep in atomic context bugs caused by dev_coredumpv

    [ Upstream commit a52ed4866d2b90dd5e4ae9dabd453f3ed8fa3cbc ]

    There are sleep in atomic context bugs when uploading device dump
    data in mwifiex. The root cause is that dev_coredumpv could not
    be used in atomic contexts, because it calls dev_set_name which
    include operations that may sleep. The call tree shows execution
    paths that could lead to bugs:

       (Interrupt context)
    fw_dump_timer_fn
      mwifiex_upload_device_dump
        dev_coredumpv(..., GFP_KERNEL)
          dev_coredumpm()
            kzalloc(sizeof(*devcd), gfp); //may sleep
            dev_set_name
              kobject_set_name_vargs
                kvasprintf_const(GFP_KERNEL, ...); //may sleep
                kstrdup(s, GFP_KERNEL); //may sleep

    KVM: Don't set Accessed/Dirty bits for ZERO_PAGE

    [ Upstream commit a1040b0d42acf69bb4f6dbdc54c2dcd78eea1de5 ]

    Don't set Accessed/Dirty bits for a struct page with PG_reserved set,
    i.e. don't set A/D bits for the ZERO_PAGE.  The ZERO_PAGE (or pages
    depending on the architecture) should obviously never be written, and
    similarly there's no point in marking it accessed as the page will never
    be swapped out or reclaimed.  The comment in page-flags.h is quite clear
    that PG_reserved pages should be managed only by their owner, and
    strictly following that mandate also simplifies KVM's logic.

    clk: imx93: use adc_root as the parent clock of adc1

    [ Upstream commit 18d6d8fe4f24938985844d52c481b86fcce9d102 ]

    When debug, find after system boot up, all adc register operation
    will trigger system hang, this is because the internal adc ipg
    clock is gate off. In dts, only reference the IMX93_CLK_ADC1_GATE,
    which is adc1, no one touch the adc_root, so adc_root will be gate
    off automatically after system boot up.

    clk: mediatek: reset: Fix written reset bit offset

    [ Upstream commit edabcf71d100fd433a0fc2d0c97057c446c33b2a ]

    Original assert/deassert bit is BIT(0), but it's more resonable to modify
    them to BIT(id % 32) which is based on id.

    This patch will not influence any previous driver because the reset is
    only used for thermal. The id (MT8183_INFRACFG_AO_THERM_SW_RST) is 0.

    iio: adc: ti-adc108s102: Fix alignment for DMA safety

    [ Upstream commit 6909fe17888b66ea53ebb15640f82b97daa587a0 ]

    ____cacheline_aligned is an insufficient guarantee for non-coherent DMA
    on platforms with 128 byte cachelines above L1.  Switch to the updated
    IIO_DMA_MINALIGN definition.

    Dual fixes tags as two cases that were introduced in different patches.
    One of those patches is a fix however and likely to have been backported
    to stable kernels.

    Note the second alignment marking is likely to be unnecessary, but is
    left for now to keep this fix simple.

    iio: core: Fix IIO_ALIGN and rename as it was not sufficiently large

    [ Upstream commit 12c4efe3509b8018e76ea3ebda8227cb53bf5887 ]

    Discussion of the series:
    https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220405135758.774016-1-catalin.marinas@arm.com/
    mm, arm64: Reduce ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN brought to my attention that
    our current IIO usage of L1CACHE_ALIGN is insufficient as their are Arm
    platforms out their with non coherent DMA and larger cache lines at
    at higher levels of their cache hierarchy.

    Rename the define to make it's purpose more explicit. It will be used
    much more widely going forwards (to replace incorrect ____cacheline_aligned
    markings.

    Note this patch will greatly reduce the padding on some architectures
    that have smaller requirements for DMA safe buffers.

    The history of changing values of ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN via
    ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN on arm64 is rather complex. I'm not tagging this
    as fixing a particular patch from that route as it's not clear what to tag.

    Most recently a change to bring them back inline was reverted because
    of some Qualcomm Kryo cores with an L2 cache with 128-byte lines
    sitting above the point of coherency.

    c1132702c71f Revert "arm64: cache: Lower ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN to 64 (L1_CACHE_BYTES)"
    That reverts:
    65688d2a05de arm64: cache: Lower ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN to 64 (L1_CACHE_BYTES) which
    refers to the change originally being motivated by Thunder x1 performance
    rather than correctness.

    [ Upstream commit 12c99f859fd3da5fc8f8491826e7023001f54821 ]

    This is a conversion to device-managed by using devm_iio_device_register()
    inside probe function. Previously the bma400 was not put into power down
    mode in some error paths in probe where it now is, but that should cause
    no harm.

    The dev_set_drvdata() call, bma400_remove() function and hooks in the I2C
    and SPI driver struct is removed as devm_iio_device_register() function is
    used to automatically unregister on driver detach.

    platform/chrome: cros_ec: Always expose last resume result

    [ Upstream commit 74bb746407bf0d7c7d126c7731dbcd66d467619b ]

    The last resume result exposing logic in cros_ec_sleep_event()
    incorrectly requires S0ix support, which doesn't work on ARM based
    systems where S0ix doesn't exist. That's because cros_ec_sleep_event()
    only reports the last resume result when the EC indicates the last sleep
    event was an S0ix resume. On ARM systems, the last sleep event is always
    S3 resume, but the EC can still detect sleep hang events in case some
    other part of the AP is blocking sleep.

    Always expose the last resume result if the EC supports it so that this
    works on all devices regardless of S0ix support. This fixes sleep hang
    detection on ARM based chromebooks like Trogdor.

    If the session is down and the local port continues to receive AUTH ELS
    messages, the driver needs to send back LOGO so that the remote device
    knows to tear down its session. Terminate and clean up the AUTH ELS
    exchange followed by a passthrough LOGO.

    mtd: sm_ftl: Fix deadlock caused by cancel_work_sync in sm_release

    [ Upstream commit a61528d997619a518ee8c51cf0ef0513021afaff ]

    There is a deadlock between sm_release and sm_cache_flush_work
    which is a work item. The cancel_work_sync in sm_release will
    not return until sm_cache_flush_work is finished. If we hold
    mutex_lock and use cancel_work_sync to wait the work item to
    finish, the work item also requires mutex_lock. As a result,
    the sm_release will be blocked forever. The race condition is
    shown below:

        (Thread 1)             |   (Thread 2)
    sm_release                 |
      mutex_lock(&ftl->mutex)  | sm_cache_flush_work
                               |   mutex_lock(&ftl->mutex)
      cancel_work_sync         |   ...

    This patch moves del_timer_sync and cancel_work_sync out of
    mutex_lock in order to mitigate deadlock.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Drop RWX=0 SPTEs during ept_sync_page()

    [ Upstream commit 9fb3565743d58352f00964bf47213b88aff4bb82 ]

    All of sync_page()'s existing checks filter out only !PRESENT gPTE,
    because without execute-only, all upper levels are guaranteed to be at
    least READABLE.  However, if EPT with execute-only support is in use by
    L1, KVM can create an SPTE that is shadow-present but guest-inaccessible
    (RWX=0) if the upper level combined permissions are R (or RW) and
    the leaf EPTE is changed from R (or RW) to X.  Because the EPTE is
    considered present when viewed in isolation, and no reserved bits are set,
    FNAME(prefetch_invalid_gpte) will consider the GPTE valid, and cause a
    not-present SPTE to be created.

    The SPTE is "correct": the guest translation is inaccessible because
    the combined protections of all levels yield RWX=0, and KVM will just
    redirect any vmexits to the guest.  If EPT A/D bits are disabled, KVM
    can mistake the SPTE for an access-tracked SPTE, but again such confusion
    isn't fatal, as the "saved" protections are also RWX=0.  However,
    creating a useless SPTE in general means that KVM messed up something,
    even if this particular goof didn't manifest as a functional bug.
    So, drop SPTEs whose new protections will yield a RWX=0 SPTE, and
    add a WARN in make_spte() to detect creation of SPTEs that will
    result in RWX=0 protections.

    KVM: SVM: Stuff next_rip on emulated INT3 injection if NRIPS is supported

    [ Upstream commit 3741aec4c38fa4123ab08ae552f05366d4fd05d8 ]

    If NRIPS is supported in hardware but disabled in KVM, set next_rip to
    the next RIP when advancing RIP as part of emulating INT3 injection.
    There is no flag to tell the CPU that KVM isn't using next_rip, and so
    leaving next_rip is left as is will result in the CPU pushing garbage
    onto the stack when vectoring the injected event.

    KVM: SVM: Unwind "speculative" RIP advancement if INTn injection "fails"

    [ Upstream commit cd9e6da8048c5b40315ee2d929b6230ce1252c3c ]

    Unwind the RIP advancement done by svm_queue_exception() when injecting
    an INT3 ultimately "fails" due to the CPU encountering a VM-Exit while
    vectoring the injected event, even if the exception reported by the CPU
    isn't the same event that was injected.  If vectoring INT3 encounters an
    exception, e.g. #NP, and vectoring the #NP encounters an intercepted
    exception, e.g. #PF when KVM is using shadow paging, then the #NP will
    be reported as the event that was in-progress.

    Note, this is still imperfect, as it will get a false positive if the
    INT3 is cleanly injected, no VM-Exit occurs before the IRET from the INT3
    handler in the guest, the instruction following the INT3 generates an
    exception (directly or indirectly), _and_ vectoring that exception
    encounters an exception that is intercepted by KVM.  The false positives
    could theoretically be solved by further analyzing the vectoring event,
    e.g. by comparing the error code against the expected error code were an
    exception to occur when vectoring the original injected exception, but
    SVM without NRIPS is a complete disaster, trying to make it 100% correct
    is a waste of time.

    [ Upstream commit aec55325ddec975216119da000092cb8664a3399 ]

    After initiator has burned up all login retries, target authentication
    application begins to run. This triggers a link bounce on target side.
    Initiator will attempt another login. Due to N2N, the PRLI [nvme | fcp] can
    fail because of the mode mismatch with target. This patch add a few more
    login retries to revive the connection.

    of: check previous kernel's ima-kexec-buffer against memory bounds

    [ Upstream commit cbf9c4b9617b6767886a913705ca14b7600c77db ]

    Presently ima_get_kexec_buffer() doesn't check if the previous kernel's
    ima-kexec-buffer lies outside the addressable memory range. This can result
    in a kernel panic if the new kernel is booted with 'mem=X' arg and the
    ima-kexec-buffer was allocated beyond that range by the previous kernel.
    The panic is usually of the form below:

    $ sudo kexec --initrd initrd vmlinux --append='mem=16G'

    As per RZ/G2L HW(Rev.1.10) manual, reset monitor register value 0 means
    reset signal is not applied (deassert state) and 1 means reset signal
    is applied (assert state).

    reset_control_status() expects a positive value if the reset line is
    asserted. But rzg2l_cpg_status function returns zero for asserted
    state.

    This patch fixes the issue by adding double inverted logic, so that
    reset_control_status returns a positive value if the reset line is
    asserted.

    [ Upstream commit ec0da06337751b18f6dee06b6526e0f0d6e80369 ]

    When meson_nfc_nand_chip_cleanup() is called, it will call:

            nand_cleanup(&meson_chip->nand);

    nand_cleanup() in turn will call nand_detach() which calls the
    .detach_chip() which is here meson_nand_detach_chip().

    meson_nand_detach_chip() already calls meson_nfc_free_buffer(), so we
    could double free some memory.

    Fix it by removing the unneeded explicit call to meson_nfc_free_buffer().

    HID: amd_sfh: Don't show client init failed as error when discovery fails

    [ Upstream commit e51d8d3ea3d773334d2c047c8d1623dba66f592a ]

    When sensor discovery fails, this means that the system doesn't have
    any sensors connected and a user should only be notified at most one time.
    A message is already displayed at WARN level of "failed to discover,
    sensors not enabled".  It's pointless to show that the client init failed
    at ERR level for the same condition.

    Check the return code and don't display this message in those conditions.

    wireguard: allowedips: don't corrupt stack when detecting overflow

    [ Upstream commit c31b14d86dfe7174361e8c6e5df6c2c3a4d5918c ]

    In case push_rcu() and related functions are buggy, there's a
    WARN_ON(len >= 128), which the selftest tries to hit by being tricky. In
    case it is hit, we shouldn't corrupt the kernel's stack, though;
    otherwise it may be hard to even receive the report that it's buggy. So
    conditionalize the stack write based on that WARN_ON()'s return value.

    Note that this never *actually* happens anyway. The WARN_ON() in the
    first place is bounded by IS_ENABLED(DEBUG), and isn't expected to ever
    actually hit. This is just a debugging sanity check.

    Additionally, hoist the constant 128 into a named enum,
    MAX_ALLOWEDIPS_BITS, so that it's clear why this value is chosen.

    wireguard: ratelimiter: use hrtimer in selftest

    [ Upstream commit 151c8e499f4705010780189377f85b57400ccbf5 ]

    Using msleep() is problematic because it's compared against
    ratelimiter.c's ktime_get_coarse_boottime_ns(), which means on systems
    with slow jiffies (such as UML's forced HZ=100), the result is
    inaccurate. So switch to using schedule_hrtimeout().

    However, hrtimer gives us access only to the traditional posix timers,
    and none of the _COARSE variants. So now, rather than being too
    imprecise like jiffies, it's too precise.

    One solution would be to give it a large "range" value, but this will
    still fire early on a loaded system. A better solution is to align the
    timeout to the actual coarse timer, and then round up to the nearest
    tick, plus change.

    So add the timeout to the current coarse time, and then
    schedule_hrtimer() until the absolute computed time.

    This should hopefully reduce flakes in CI as well. Note that we keep the
    retry loop in case the entire function is running behind, because the
    test could still be scheduled out, by either the kernel or by the
    hypervisor's kernel, in which case restarting the test and hoping to not
    be scheduled out still helps.

    [ Upstream commit 8eaa1d110800fac050bab44001732747a1c39894 ]

    Striding RQ uses MTT page mapping, where each page corresponds to an XSK
    frame. MTT pages have alignment requirements, and XSK frames don't have
    any alignment guarantees in the unaligned mode. Frames with improper
    alignment must be discarded, otherwise the packet data will be written
    at a wrong address.

    net: usb: make USB_RTL8153_ECM non user configurable

    [ Upstream commit f56530dcdb0684406661ac9f1accf48319d07600 ]

    This refixes:

        commit 7da17624e7948d5d9660b910f8079d26d26ce453
        nt: usb: USB_RTL8153_ECM should not default to y

        In general, device drivers should not be enabled by default.

    which basically broke the commit it claimed to fix, ie:

        commit 657bc1d10bfc23ac06d5d687ce45826c760744f9
        r8153_ecm: avoid to be prior to r8152 driver

        Avoid r8153_ecm is compiled as built-in, if r8152 driver is compiled
        as modules. Otherwise, the r8153_ecm would be used, even though the
        device is supported by r8152 driver.

    this commit amounted to:

    drivers/net/usb/Kconfig:

    +config USB_RTL8153_ECM
    +       tristate "RTL8153 ECM support"
    +       depends on USB_NET_CDCETHER && (USB_RTL8152 || USB_RTL8152=n)
    +       default y
    +       help
    +         This option supports ECM mode for RTL8153 ethernet adapter, when
    +         CONFIG_USB_RTL8152 is not set, or the RTL8153 device is not
    +         supported by r8152 driver.

    drivers/net/usb/Makefile:

    -obj-$(CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER) += cdc_ether.o r8153_ecm.o
    +obj-$(CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER) += cdc_ether.o
    +obj-$(CONFIG_USB_RTL8153_ECM)  += r8153_ecm.o

    And as can be seen it pulls a piece of the cdc_ether driver out into
    a separate config option to be able to make this piece modular in case
    cdc_ether is builtin, while r8152 is modular.

    While in general, device drivers should indeed not be enabled by default:
    this isn't a device driver per say, but rather this is support code for
    the CDCETHER (ECM) driver, and should thus be enabled if it is enabled.

    Side note: these incorrect defaults will result in Android 13

    USB_NET_CDCETHER (luckily we also have USB_RTL8150 and USB_RTL8152,

    dccp: put dccp_qpolicy_full() and dccp_qpolicy_push() in the same lock

    [ Upstream commit a41b17ff9dacd22f5f118ee53d82da0f3e52d5e3 ]

    In the case of sk->dccps_qpolicy == DCCPQ_POLICY_PRIO, dccp_qpolicy_full
    will drop a skb when qpolicy is full. And the lock in dccp_sendmsg is
    released before sock_alloc_send_skb and then relocked after
    sock_alloc_send_skb. The following conditions may lead dccp_qpolicy_push
    to add skb to an already full sk_write_queue:

    thread1--->lock
    thread1--->dccp_qpolicy_full: queue is full. drop a skb
    thread1--->unlock
    thread2--->lock
    thread2--->dccp_qpolicy_full: queue is not full. no need to drop.
    thread2--->unlock
    thread1--->lock
    thread1--->dccp_qpolicy_push: add a skb. queue is full.
    thread1--->unlock
    thread2--->lock
    thread2--->dccp_qpolicy_push: add a skb!
    thread2--->unlock

    Fix this by moving dccp_qpolicy_full.

    Bernard reported that trying to unload rose module would lead
    to infamous messages:

    unregistered_netdevice: waiting for rose0 to become free. Usage count = xx

    This patch solves the issue, by making sure each socket referring to
    a netdevice holds a reference count on it, and properly releases it
    in rose_release().

    rose_dev_first() is also fixed to take a device reference
    before leaving the rcu_read_locked section.

    Following patch will add ref_tracker annotations to ease
    future bug hunting.

    iavf: Fix 'tc qdisc show' listing too many queues

    Check for minimum value provided and if it fits expected 50Mbps

    2@0 2@2 2@4 hw 1 mode channel shaper bw_rlimit \
    max_rate 50Mbps 500Mbps 500Mbps

    The function alloc_workqueue() in rtw_core_init() can fail, but
    there is no check of its return value. To fix this bug, its return value
    should be checked with new error handling code.

    netdevsim: fib: Fix reference count leak on route deletion failure

    [ Upstream commit 180a6a3ee60a7cb69ed1232388460644f6a21f00 ]

    As part of FIB offload simulation, netdevsim stores IPv4 and IPv6 routes
    and holds a reference on FIB info structures that in turn hold a
    reference on the associated nexthop device(s).

    In the unlikely case where we are unable to allocate memory to process a
    route deletion request, netdevsim will not release the reference from
    the associated FIB info structure, thereby preventing the associated
    nexthop device(s) from ever being removed [1].

    Fix this by scheduling a work item that will flush netdevsim's FIB table
    upon route deletion failure. This will cause netdevsim to release its
    reference from all the FIB info structures in its table.

    Reported by Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.

    net: allow unbound socket for packets in VRF when tcp_l3mdev_accept set

    [ Upstream commit 944fd1aeacb627fa617f85f8e5a34f7ae8ea4d8e ]

    The commit 3c82a21f4320 ("net: allow binding socket in a VRF when
    there's an unbound socket") changed the inet socket lookup to avoid
    packets in a VRF from matching an unbound socket. This is to ensure the
    necessary isolation between the default and other VRFs for routing and
    forwarding. VRF-unaware processes running in the default VRF cannot
    access another VRF and have to be run with 'ip vrf exec <vrf>'. This is
    to be expected with tcp_l3mdev_accept disabled, but could be reallowed
    when this sysctl option is enabled. So instead of directly checking dif
    and sdif in inet[6]_match, here call inet_sk_bound_dev_eq(). This
    allows a match on unbound socket for non-zero sdif i.e. for packets in
    a VRF, if tcp_l3mdev_accept is enabled.

    INET6_MATCH() runs without holding a lock on the socket.

    We probably need to annotate most reads.

    This patch makes INET6_MATCH() an inline function
    to ease our changes.

    v2: inline function only defined if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)

    ax25: fix incorrect dev_tracker usage

    [ Upstream commit d7c4c9e075f8cc6d88d277bc24e5d99297f03c06 ]

    While investigating a separate rose issue [1], and enabling
    CONFIG_NET_DEV_REFCNT_TRACKER=y, Bernard reported an orthogonal ax25 issue [2]

    An ax25_dev can be used by one (or many) struct ax25_cb.
    We thus need different dev_tracker, one per struct ax25_cb.

    After this patch is applied, we are able to focus on rose.

    net/mlx5: Fix driver use of uninitialized timeout

    [ Upstream commit 42b4f7f66a43cdb9216e76e595c8a9af154806da ]

    Currently, driver is setting default values to all timeouts during
    function setup. The offending commit is using a timeout before
    function setup, meaning: the timeout is 0 (or garbage), since no
    value have been set.
    This may result in failure to probe the driver:
    mlx5_function_setup:1034:(pid 69850): Firmware over 4294967296 MS in pre-initializing state, aborting
    probe_one:1591:(pid 69850): mlx5_init_one failed with error code -16

    Hence, set default values to timeouts during tout_init()

    net/mlx5: DR, Fix SMFS steering info dump format

    [ Upstream commit 62d2664351ef37da34f6f3a3fd8ab34257d6fe30 ]

    Fix several issues in SMFS steering info dump:
     - Fix outdated macro value for matcher mask in the SMFS debug dump format.
       The existing value denotes the old format of the matcher mask, as it was
       used during the early stages of development, and it results in wrong
       parsing by the steering dump parser - wrong fields are shown in the
       parsed output.
     - Add the missing destination table to the dumped action.
       The missing dest table handle breaks the ability to associate between
       the "go to table" action and the actual table in the steering info.

    The cited commit limited log_max_qp to be 17 due to FW capabilities.
    Recently, it turned out that there are old FW versions that supported
    more than 17, so the cited commit caused a degradation.

    net/mlx5e: Fix calculations related to max MPWQE size

    [ Upstream commit 677e78c8d44f326a73a77d71acf3a49ea562c1d9 ]

    Before commit 76c31e5f7585 ("net/mlx5e: Use FW limitation for max MPW
    WQEBBs"), the maximum size of MPWQE in WQEBBs was hardcoded as a driver
    constant. That commit started using the firmware capability that can
    further limit the size, however, it unintentionally changed a few
    things:

    1. The calculation of MLX5E_MAX_KLM_PER_WQE used the size in DS, which
    was replaced by the size in WQEBBs, making the resulting value 4 times
    smaller.

    2. MLX5E_TX_MPW_MAX_WQEBBS used to be aligned to the cache line size
    (either 64 or 128 bytes, i.e. 1 or 2 WQEBBs), but it's no longer the
    case if the firmware capability is smaller than the driver maximum.

    Fix both issues by using the correct units for MLX5E_MAX_KLM_PER_WQE and
    by aligning mlx5e_get_sw_max_sq_mpw_wqebbs after taking the minimum.

    Besides fixing the arithmetics in calculation of MLX5E_MAX_KLM_PER_WQE,
    also use appropriate constants: `size of BSF * num of DS per WQEBB *
    number of WQEBBs` (the calculation before the blamed commit) doesn't
    make much sense to calculate the WQE size in bytes, so just use `size of
    WQEBB * number of WQEBBs`.

    While at it, replace the types that hold the number of WQEBBs by u8.
    These values don't exceed 16, and it allows to fill holes in two
    structs.

    net/mlx5e: xsk: Account for XSK RQ UMRs when calculating ICOSQ size

    [ Upstream commit 52586d2f56b3e4f528ca7268d65074e92c936681 ]

    ICOSQ is used to post UMR WQEs for both regular RQ and XSK RQ. However,
    space in ICOSQ is reserved only for the regular RQ, which may cause
    ICOSQ overflows when using XSK (the most risk is on activating
    channels).

    This commit fixes the issue by reserving space for XSK UMR WQEs as well.
    As XSK may be enabled without restarting the channel and recreating the
    ICOSQ, this space is reserved unconditionally.

    [ Upstream commit 143201a6435bf65f0115435e9dc6d95c66b908e9 ]

    Not all DPB entries will be used most of the time. Unused entries will
    thus have invalid timestamps. They will produce negative buffer index
    which is not specifically handled. This works just by chance in current
    code. It will even produce bogus pointer, but since it's not used, it
    won't do any harm.

    Let's fix that brittle design by skipping writing DPB entry altogether
    if timestamp is invalid.

    i2c: cadence: Support PEC for SMBus block read

    [ Upstream commit 9fdf6d97f03035ad5298e2d1635036c74c2090ed ]

    SMBus packet error checking (PEC) is implemented by appending one
    additional byte of checksum data at the end of the message. This provides
    additional protection and allows to detect data corruption on the I2C bus.

    SMBus block reads support variable length reads. The first byte in the read
    message is the number of available data bytes.

    The combination of PEC and block read is currently not supported by the
    Cadence I2C driver.
     * When PEC is enabled the maximum transfer length for block reads
       increases from 33 to 34 bytes.
     * The I2C core smbus emulation layer relies on the driver updating the
       `i2c_msg` `len` field with the number of received bytes. The updated
       length is used when checking the PEC.

    Add support to the Cadence I2C driver for handling SMBus block reads with
    PEC. To determine the maximum transfer length uses the initial `len` value
    of the `i2c_msg`. When PEC is enabled this will be 2, when it is disabled
    it will be 1.

    Once a read transfer is done also increment the `len` field by the amount
    of received data bytes.

    This change has been tested with a UCM90320 PMBus power monitor, which
    requires block reads to access certain data fields, but also has PEC
    enabled by default.

    Bluetooth: Add default wakeup callback for HCI UART driver

    [ Upstream commit bee5395ced44c5a312348557eb2dfb0c2a7bfaa2 ]

    Bluetooth HCI devices indicate if they are able to wakeup in the wakeup
    callback since 'commit 4539ca67fe8e ("Bluetooth: Rename driver
    .prevent_wake to .wakeup")'. This patch adds a default wakeup callback
    for Bluetooth HCI UAR devices. It assumes Bluetooth HCI UART devices are
    wakeable for backward compatibility. For those who need a customized
    behavior, one can override it before calling hci_uart_register_device().

    [ Upstream commit e70a3263a7eed768d5f947b8f2aff8d2a79c9d97 ]

    Currently, data[5..7] of struct can_frame, when used as a CAN error
    frame, are defined as being "controller specific". Device specific
    behaviours are problematic because it prevents someone from writing
    code which is portable between devices.

    As a matter of fact, data[5] is never used, data[6] is always used to
    report TX error counter and data[7] is always used to report RX error
    counter. can-utils also relies on this.

    This patch updates the comment in the uapi header to specify that
    data[5] is reserved (and thus should not be used) and that data[6..7]
    are used for error counters.

    bpf: Wire up freeing of referenced kptr

    [ Upstream commit 14a324f6a67ef6a53e04362a70160a47eb8afffa ]

    A destructor kfunc can be defined as void func(type *), where type may
    be void or any other pointer type as per convenience.

    In this patch, we ensure that the type is sane and capture the function
    pointer into off_desc of ptr_off_tab for the specific pointer offset,
    with the invariant that the dtor pointer is always set when 'kptr_ref'
    tag is applied to the pointer's pointee type, which is indicated by the
    flag BPF_MAP_VALUE_OFF_F_REF.

    Note that only BTF IDs whose destructor kfunc is registered, thus become
    the allowed BTF IDs for embedding as referenced kptr. Hence it serves
    the purpose of finding dtor kfunc BTF ID, as well acting as a check
    against the whitelist of allowed BTF IDs for this purpose.

    Finally, wire up the actual freeing of the referenced pointer if any at
    all available offsets, so that no references are leaked after the BPF
    map goes away and the BPF program previously moved the ownership a
    referenced pointer into it.

    The behavior is similar to BPF timers, where bpf_map_{update,delete}_elem
    will free any existing referenced kptr. The same case is with LRU map's
    bpf_lru_push_free/htab_lru_push_free functions, which are extended to
    reset unreferenced and free referenced kptr.

    Note that unlike BPF timers, kptr is not reset or freed when map uref
    drops to zero.

    bpf: Populate pairs of btf_id and destructor kfunc in btf

    [ Upstream commit 5ce937d613a423ca3102f53d9f3daf4210c1b6e2 ]

    To support storing referenced PTR_TO_BTF_ID in maps, we require
    associating a specific BTF ID with a 'destructor' kfunc. This is because
    we need to release a live referenced pointer at a certain offset in map
    value from the map destruction path, otherwise we end up leaking
    resources.

    Hence, introduce support for passing an array of btf_id, kfunc_btf_id
    pairs that denote a BTF ID and its associated release function. Then,
    add an accessor 'btf_find_dtor_kfunc' which can be used to look up the
    destructor kfunc of a certain BTF ID. If found, we can use it to free
    the object from the map free path.

    The registration of these pairs also serve as a whitelist of structures
    which are allowed as referenced PTR_TO_BTF_ID in a BPF map, because
    without finding the destructor kfunc, we will bail and return an error.

    bpf: Adapt copy_map_value for multiple offset case

    [ Upstream commit 4d7d7f69f4b104b2ddeec6a1e7fcfd2d044ed8c4 ]

    Since now there might be at most 10 offsets that need handling in
    copy_map_value, the manual shuffling and special case is no longer going
    to work. Hence, let's generalise the copy_map_value function by using
    a sorted array of offsets to skip regions that must be avoided while
    copying into and out of a map value.

    When the map is created, we populate the offset array in struct map,
    Then, copy_map_value uses this sorted offset array is used to memcpy
    while skipping timer, spin lock, and kptr. The array is allocated as
    in most cases none of these special fields would be present in map
    value, hence we can save on space for the common case by not embedding
    the entire object inside bpf_map struct.

    bpf: Allow storing referenced kptr in map

    [ Upstream commit c0a5a21c25f37c9fd7b36072f9968cdff1e4aa13 ]

    Extending the code in previous commits, introduce referenced kptr
    support, which needs to be tagged using 'kptr_ref' tag instead. Unlike
    unreferenced kptr, referenced kptr have a lot more restrictions. In
    addition to the type matching, only a newly introduced bpf_kptr_xchg
    helper is allowed to modify the map value at that offset. This transfers
    the referenced pointer being stored into the map, releasing the
    references state for the program, and returning the old value and
    creating new reference state for the returned pointer.

    Similar to unreferenced pointer case, return value for this case will
    also be PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL. The reference for the returned pointer
    must either be eventually released by calling the corresponding release
    function, otherwise it must be transferred into another map.

    It is also allowed to call bpf_kptr_xchg with a NULL pointer, to clear
    the value, and obtain the old value if any.

    BPF_LDX, BPF_STX, and BPF_ST cannot access referenced kptr. A future
    commit will permit using BPF_LDX for such pointers, but attempt at
    making it safe, since the lifetime of object won't be guaranteed.

    There are valid reasons to enforce the restriction of permitting only
    bpf_kptr_xchg to operate on referenced kptr. The pointer value must be
    consistent in face of concurrent modification, and any prior values
    contained in the map must also be released before a new one is moved
    into the map. To ensure proper transfer of this ownership, bpf_kptr_xchg
    returns the old value, which the verifier would require the user to
    either free or move into another map, and releases the reference held
    for the pointer being moved in.

    In the future, direct BPF_XCHG instruction may also be permitted to work
    like bpf_kptr_xchg helper.

    Note that process_kptr_func doesn't have to call
    check_helper_mem_access, since we already disallow rdonly/wronly flags
    for map, which is what check_map_access_type checks, and we already
    ensure the PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE refers to kptr by obtaining its off_desc,
    so check_map_access is also not required.

    bpf: Tag argument to be released in bpf_func_proto

    [ Upstream commit 8f14852e89113d738c99c375b4c8b8b7e1073df1 ]

    Add a new type flag for bpf_arg_type that when set tells verifier that
    for a release function, that argument's register will be the one for
    which meta.ref_obj_id will be set, and which will then be released
    using release_reference. To capture the regno, introduce a new field
    release_regno in bpf_call_arg_meta.

    This would be required in the next patch, where we may either pass NULL
    or a refcounted pointer as an argument to the release function
    bpf_kptr_xchg. Just releasing only when meta.ref_obj_id is set is not
    enough, as there is a case where the type of argument needed matches,
    but the ref_obj_id is set to 0. Hence, we must enforce that whenever
    meta.ref_obj_id is zero, the register that is to be released can only
    be NULL for a release function.

    Since we now indicate whether an argument is to be released in
    bpf_func_proto itself, is_release_function helper has lost its utitlity,
    hence refactor code to work without it, and just rely on
    meta.release_regno to know when to release state for a ref_obj_id.
    Still, the restriction of one release argument and only one ref_obj_id
    passed to BPF helper or kfunc remains. This may be lifted in the future.

    bpf: Allow storing unreferenced kptr in map

    [ Upstream commit 61df10c7799e27807ad5e459eec9d77cddf8bf45 ]

    This commit introduces a new pointer type 'kptr' which can be embedded
    in a map value to hold a PTR_TO_BTF_ID stored by a BPF program during
    its invocation. When storing such a kptr, BPF program's PTR_TO_BTF_ID
    register must have the same type as in the map value's BTF, and loading
    a kptr marks the destination register as PTR_TO_BTF_ID with the correct
    kernel BTF and BTF ID.

    Such kptr are unreferenced, i.e. by the time another invocation of the
    BPF program loads this pointer, the object which the pointer points to
    may not longer exist. Since PTR_TO_BTF_ID loads (using BPF_LDX) are
    patched to PROBE_MEM loads by the verifier, it would safe to allow user
    to still access such invalid pointer, but passing such pointers into
    BPF helpers and kfuncs should not be permitted. A future patch in this
    series will close this gap.

    The flexibility offered by allowing programs to dereference such invalid
    pointers while being safe at runtime frees the verifier from doing
    complex lifetime tracking. As long as the user may ensure that the
    object remains valid, it can ensure data read by it from the kernel
    object is valid.

    The user indicates that a certain pointer must be treated as kptr
    capable of accepting stores of PTR_TO_BTF_ID of a certain type, by using
    a BTF type tag 'kptr' on the pointed to type of the pointer. Then, this
    information is recorded in the object BTF which will be passed into the
    kernel by way of map's BTF information. The name and kind from the map
    value BTF is used to look up the in-kernel type, and the actual BTF and
    BTF ID is recorded in the map struct in a new kptr_off_tab member. For
    now, only storing pointers to structs is permitted.

    An example of this specification is shown below:

            #define __kptr __attribute__((btf_type_tag("kptr")))

            struct map_value {
                    ...
                    struct task_struct __kptr *task;
                    ...
            };

    Then, in a BPF program, user may store PTR_TO_BTF_ID with the type
    task_struct into the map, and then load it later.

    Note that the destination register is marked PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL, as
    the verifier cannot know whether the value is NULL or not statically, it
    must treat all potential loads at that map value offset as loading a
    possibly NULL pointer.

    Only BPF_LDX, BPF_STX, and BPF_ST (with insn->imm = 0 to denote NULL)
    are allowed instructions that can access such a pointer. On BPF_LDX, the
    destination register is updated to be a PTR_TO_BTF_ID, and on BPF_STX,
    it is checked whether the source register type is a PTR_TO_BTF_ID with
    same BTF type as specified in the map BTF. The access size must always
    be BPF_DW.

    For the map in map support, the kptr_off_tab for outer map is copied
    from the inner map's kptr_off_tab. It was chosen to do a deep copy
    instead of introducing a refcount to kptr_off_tab, because the copy only
    needs to be done when paramterizing using inner_map_fd in the map in map
    case, hence would be unnecessary for all other users.

    It is not permitted to use MAP_FREEZE command and mmap for BPF map
    having kptrs, similar to the bpf_timer case. A kptr also requires that
    BPF program has both read and write access to the map (hence both
    BPF_F_RDONLY_PROG and BPF_F_WRONLY_PROG are disallowed).

    Note that check_map_access must be called from both
    check_helper_mem_access and for the BPF instructions, hence the kptr
    check must distinguish between ACCESS_DIRECT and ACCESS_HELPER, and
    reject ACCESS_HELPER cases. We rename stack_access_src to bpf_access_src
    and reuse it for this purpose.

    drm/amdgpu: cleanup ctx implementation

    [ Upstream commit 69493c034d2455204dfcd370de8c4dc204374a94 ]

    Let each context have a pointer to the ctx manager and properly
    initialize the adev pointer inside the context manager.

    Reduce the BUG_ON() in amdgpu_ctx_add_fence() into a WARN_ON() and
    directly return the sequence number instead of writing into a parmeter.

    Now that we know real purpose of "not low delay" flag, logic for
    applying this flag should be fixed too. According to vendor and
    reference implementation, low delay is signaled when POC of current
    frame is lower than POC of at least one reference of a slice.

    Implement mentioned logic and invert it to conform to flag meaning. Also
    don't apply flag for I frames. They don't have any reference.

    This fixes decoding of 3 reference bitstreams.

    fs: check FMODE_LSEEK to control internal pipe splicing

    [ Upstream commit 97ef77c52b789ec1411d360ed99dca1efe4b2c81 ]

    The original direct splicing mechanism from Jens required the input to
    be a regular file because it was avoiding the special socket case. It
    also recognized blkdevs as being close enough to a regular file. But it
    forgot about chardevs, which behave the same way and work fine here.

    This is an okayish heuristic, but it doesn't totally work. For example,
    a few chardevs should be spliceable here. And a few regular files
    shouldn't. This patch fixes this by instead checking whether FMODE_LSEEK
    is set, which represents decently enough what we need rewinding for when
    splicing to internal pipes.

    libbpf: Fix the name of a reused map

    [ Upstream commit bf3f00378524adae16628cbadbd11ba7211863bb ]

    BPF map name is limited to BPF_OBJ_NAME_LEN.
    A map name is defined as being longer than BPF_OBJ_NAME_LEN,
    it will be truncated to BPF_OBJ_NAME_LEN when a userspace program
    calls libbpf to create the map. A pinned map also generates a path
    in the /sys. If the previous program wanted to reuse the map，
    it can not get bpf_map by name, because the name of the map is only
    partially the same as the name which get from pinned path.

    The syscall information below show that map name "process_pinned_map"
    is truncated to "process_pinned_".

        bpf(BPF_OBJ_GET, {pathname="/sys/fs/bpf/process_pinned_map",
        bpf_fd=0, file_flags=0}, 144) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

        bpf(BPF_MAP_CREATE, {map_type=BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH, key_size=4,
        value_size=4,max_entries=1024, map_flags=0, inner_map_fd=0,
        map_name="process_pinned_",map_ifindex=0, btf_fd=3, btf_key_type_id=6,
        btf_value_type_id=10,btf_vmlinux_value_type_id=0}, 72) = 4

    This patch check that if the name of pinned map are the same as the
    actual name for the first (BPF_OBJ_NAME_LEN - 1),
    bpf map still uses the name which is included in bpf object.

    bpf, x86: fix freeing of not-finalized bpf_prog_pack

    [ Upstream commit 1d5f82d9dd477d5c66e0214a68c3e4f308eadd6d ]

    syzbot reported a few issues with bpf_prog_pack [1], [2]. This only happens
    with multiple subprogs. In jit_subprogs(), we first call bpf_int_jit_compile()
    on each sub program. And then, we call it on each sub program again. jit_data
    is not freed in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile(). Similarly we don't
    call bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile().

    If bpf_int_jit_compile() failed for one sub program, we will call
    bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() for this sub program. However, we don't have a
    chance to call it for other sub programs. Then we will hit "goto out_free" in
    jit_subprogs(), and call bpf_jit_free on some subprograms that haven't got
    bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() yet.

    At this point, bpf_jit_binary_pack_free() is called and the whole 2MB page is
    freed erroneously.

    Fix this with a custom bpf_jit_free() for x86_64, which calls
    bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() if necessary. Also, with custom
    bpf_jit_free(), bpf_prog_aux->use_bpf_prog_pack is not needed any more,
    remove it.

    bpf, x64: Add predicate for bpf2bpf with tailcalls support in JIT

    [ Upstream commit 95acd8817e66d031d2e6ee7def3f1e1874819317 ]

    The BPF core/verifier is hard-coded to permit mixing bpf2bpf and tail
    calls for only x86-64. Change the logic to instead rely on a new weak
    function 'bool bpf_jit_supports_subprog_tailcalls(void)', which a capable
    JIT backend can override.

    Update the x86-64 eBPF JIT to reflect this.

    skmsg: Fix invalid last sg check in sk_msg_recvmsg()

    [ Upstream commit 9974d37ea75f01b47d16072b5dad305bd8d23fcc ]

    In sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue function, if the linear area + nr_frags +
    frag_list of the SKB has NR_MSG_FRAG_IDS blocks in total, skb_to_sgvec
    will return NR_MSG_FRAG_IDS, then msg->sg.end will be set to
    NR_MSG_FRAG_IDS, and in addition, (NR_MSG_FRAG_IDS - 1) is set to the last
    SG of msg. Recv the msg in sk_msg_recvmsg, when i is (NR_MSG_FRAG_IDS - 1),
    the sk_msg_iter_var_next(i) will change i to 0 (not NR_MSG_FRAG_IDS), the
    judgment condition "msg_rx->sg.start==msg_rx->sg.end" and
    "i != msg_rx->sg.end" can not work.

    As a result, the processed msg cannot be deleted from ingress_msg list.
    But the length of all the sge of the msg has changed to 0. Then the next
    recvmsg syscall will process the msg repeatedly, because the length of sge
    is 0, the -EFAULT error is always returned.

    For some reason, mt7615 reacts badly to repeatedly enabling/disabling the radar
    detector without also switching the channel.
    This results in very bad throughput on DFS channels, because
    hw->conf.radar_enabled can get toggled a few times after CAC ends.
    Fix this by always leaving the DFS detector enabled on DFS channels and instead
    suppress unwanted detection events.

    After that, there is no need to make a workaround for poll function.
    driver can use v4l2_m2m_fop_poll directly.

    for NV12_4L4 and NV12 pixel formats. The first one use a 4 bytes padding
    while the last one needs 16 bytes.
    To be sure to provide the correct stride in all cases we need:
    - to relax the constraints on codec formats so set step_width to 4
    - use capture queue format and not the output queue format when applying
      the pixel format constraints.
    - put the correct step_width constraints on each pixel format.

    Move HEVC SPS validation in hantro_hevc.c to be able to perform it
    when setting sps control and when starting to decode the bitstream.
    Add a new test in HEVC SPS validation function to check if resolution
    is still matching the hardware constraints.

    With this SAODBLK_A_MainConcept_4 and SAODBLK_B_MainConcept_4 conformance
    tests files are correctly decoded with both NV12 and NV12_4L4 pixel
    formats. These two files have a resolution of 1016x760.

    Add defines for the various used resolutions.
    For other variants than Hantro G2 on IMX8M keep the same step_width to
    avoid regressions.

    Fluster HEVC test score is now 128/147 vs 126/147 with the both pixel
    formats as decoder output.
    Fluster VP9 test score stay at 147/303.

    media: hantro: HEVC: Fix reference frames management

    [ Upstream commit 387d1176956883635c63a7d1c91b1f45e19c1777 ]

    PoC shall be int the range of -2^31 to 2^31 -1
    (HEVC spec section 8.3.1 Decoding process for picture order count).
    The current way to know if an entry in reference picture array is free
    is to test if PoC = UNUSED_REF. Since UNUSED_REF is defined as '-1' that
    could lead to decode issue if one PoC also equal '-1'.
    PoC with value = '-1' exists in conformance test SLIST_B_Sony_9.

    Change the way unused entries are managed in reference pictures array to
    avoid using PoC to detect then.

    This patch doesn't change fluster HEVC score.

    media: hantro: HEVC: Fix output frame chroma offset

    [ Upstream commit 579846ec52593e6ca123c30379103377cd25728a ]

    Hantro decoder doesn't take care of the requested and aligned size
    of the capture buffer.
    Stop using the bitstream width/height and use capture frame size
    stored in the context to get the correct values.

    hantro_hevc_chroma_offset() and hantro_hevc_motion_vectors_offset()
    are only used in hantro_g2_hevc_dec.c so take the opportunity
    to move them here.

    [ Upstream commit afba6e20801ad9a2f863c52c21e609e021269d83 ]

    Don't set last_buffer_dequeued during dynamic resolution change,
    otherwise it may be cleared in handling resolution change,
    as streamoff may be called in dynamic resolution change.

    Normally, this does not happen.
    But we encounter a special testcase,
    User issue V4L2_DEC_CMD_STOP after enqueue one buffer
    that only contains codec config header, but not any frame data.
    So VPU report the parsed resolution, then report the eos event.

    So driver should notify user to handle resolution change first,
    after it's handled, set the last_buffer_dequeued.
    then the user can exit decoding normally.

    Otherwise the user may be stalled.

    The decoder parameters are stored in each instance's context data. This

    changed it to only be initialized for the first opened instance. This
    resulted in subsequent instances not correctly signaling the requirement

    media: platform: mtk-mdp: Fix mdp_ipi_comm structure alignment

    [ Upstream commit ab14c99c035da7156a3b66fa171171295bc4b89a ]

    The mdp_ipi_comm structure defines a command that is either
    PROCESS (start processing) or DEINIT (destroy instance); we
    are using this one to send PROCESS or DEINIT commands from Linux
    to an MDP instance through a VPU write but, while the first wants
    us to stay 4-bytes aligned, the VPU instead requires an 8-bytes
    data alignment.

    Keeping in mind that these commands are executed immediately
    after sending them (hence not chained with others before the
    VPU/MDP "actually" start executing), it is fine to simply add
    a padding of 4 bytes to this structure: this keeps the same
    performance as before, as we're still stack-allocating it,
    while avoiding hackery inside of mtk-vpu to ensure alignment
    bringing a definitely bigger performance impact.

    drm/radeon: avoid bogus "vram limit (0) must be a power of 2" warning

    [ Upstream commit 9da2902609f7519c48eda84f953f72fee53f2b71 ]

    I was getting the following message on boot on Linux 5.19-rc5:
            radeon 0000:01:05.0: vram limit (0) must be a power of 2
    (I didn't use any radeon.vramlimit commandline parameter).

    This is caused by
    commit 8c2d34eb53b9 ("drm/radeon: use kernel is_power_of_2 rather than local version")
    which removed radeon_check_pot_argument() and converted its users to
    is_power_of_2(). The two functions differ in its handling of 0, which is
    the default value of radeon_vram_limit: radeon_check_pot_argument()
    "incorrectly" considered it a power of 2, while is_power_of_2() does not.

    An appropriate conditional silences the warning message.

    It is not necessary to add a similar test to other callers of
    is_power_of_2() in radeon_device.c. The matching commit in amdgpu:
    commit 761175078466 ("drm/amdgpu: use kernel is_power_of_2 rather than local version")
    is unaffected by this bug.

    Tested on Radeon HD 3200.

    Not ccing stable, this is not serious enough.

    drm/msm: Avoid unclocked GMU register access in 6xx gpu_busy

    [ Upstream commit 6694482a70e9536efbf2ac233cbf0c302d6e2dae ]

    From testing on sc7180-trogdor devices, reading the GMU registers
    needs the GMU clocks to be enabled. Those clocks get turned on in
    a6xx_gmu_resume(). Confusingly enough, that function is called as a
    result of the runtime_pm of the GPU "struct device", not the GMU
    "struct device". Unfortunately the current a6xx_gpu_busy() grabs a
    reference to the GMU's "struct device".

    The fact that we were grabbing the wrong reference was easily seen to
    cause crashes that happen if we change the GPU's pm_runtime usage to
    not use autosuspend. It's also believed to cause some long tail GPU
    crashes even with autosuspend.

    We could look at changing it so that we do pm_runtime_get_if_in_use()
    on the GPU's "struct device", but then we run into a different
    problem. pm_runtime_get_if_in_use() will return 0 for the GPU's
    "struct device" the whole time when we're in the "autosuspend
    delay". That is, when we drop the last reference to the GPU but we're
    waiting a period before actually suspending then we'll think the GPU
    is off. One reason that's bad is that if the GPU didn't actually turn
    off then the cycle counter doesn't lose state and that throws off all
    of our calculations.

    Let's change the code to keep track of the suspend state of
    devfreq. msm_devfreq_suspend() is always called before we actually
    suspend the GPU and msm_devfreq_resume() after we resume it. This
    means we can use the suspended state to know if we're powered or not.

    NOTE: one might wonder when exactly our status function is called when
    devfreq is supposed to be disabled. The stack crawl I captured was:
      msm_devfreq_get_dev_status
      devfreq_simple_ondemand_func
      devfreq_update_target
      qos_notifier_call

    net: hinic: avoid kernel hung in hinic_get_stats64()

    When getting device stats from bond, kernel will call bond_get_stats().
    It first holds the spinlock bond->stats_lock, and then call
    hinic_get_stats64() to collect hinic device's stats.
    However, hinic_get_stats64() calls `down(&nic_dev->mgmt_lock)` to
    protect its critical section, which may schedule current task out.
    And if system is under high pressure, the task cannot be woken up
    immediately, which eventually triggers kernel hung panic.

    Since previous patch has replaced hinic_dev.tx_stats/rx_stats with local
    variable in hinic_get_stats64(), there is nothing need to be protected
    by lock, so just removing down()/up() is ok.

    net: hinic: fix bug that ethtool get wrong stats

    [ Upstream commit 67dffd3db98570af8ff54c934f7d14664c0d182a ]

    Function hinic_get_stats64() will do two operations:
    1. reads stats from every hinic_rxq/txq and accumulates them
    2. calls hinic_rxq/txq_clean_stats() to clean every rxq/txq's stats

    For hinic_get_stats64(), it could get right data, because it sums all
    data to nic_dev->rx_stats/tx_stats.
    But it is wrong for get_drv_queue_stats(), this function will read
    hinic_rxq's stats, which have been cleared to zero by hinic_get_stats64().

    I have observed hinic's cleanup operation by using such command:
    > watch -n 1 "cat ethtool -S eth4 | tail -40"

    Result before:

    To solve this problem, we just keep every queue's total stats in their own
    queue (aka hinic_{rxq|txq}), and simply sum all per-queue stats every time
    calling hinic_get_stats64().
    With that solution, there is no need to clean per-queue stats now,
    and there is no need to maintain global hinic_dev.{tx|rx}_stats, too.

    hinic: Use the bitmap API when applicable

    [ Upstream commit 7c2c57263af41cfd8b5022274e6801542831bb69 ]

    'vlan_bitmap' is a bitmap and is used as such. So allocate it with
    devm_bitmap_zalloc() and its explicit bit size (i.e. VLAN_N_VID).

    This avoids the need of the VLAN_BITMAP_SIZE macro which:
       - needlessly has a 'nic_dev' parameter
       - should be "long" (and not byte) aligned, so that the bitmap semantic
         is respected

    This is in fact not an issue because VLAN_N_VID is 4096 at the time
    being, but devm_bitmap_zalloc() is less verbose and easier to understand.

    Provide shim definitions for the functions exported by taprio so that

    net: dsa: felix: drop oversized frames with tc-taprio instead of hanging the port

    [ Upstream commit 55a515b1f5a97df5704a1788fe97a4a740be2b9e ]

    Currently, sending a packet into a time gate too small for it (or always
    closed) causes the queue system to hold the frame forever. Even worse,
    this frame isn't subject to aging either, because for that to happen, it
    needs to be scheduled for transmission in the first place. But the frame
    will consume buffer memory and frame references while it is forever held
    in the queue system.

    Before commit a4ae997adcbd ("net: mscc: ocelot: initialize watermarks to
    sane defaults"), this behavior was somewhat subtle, as the switch had a
    more intricately tuned default watermark configuration out of reset,
    which did not allow any single port and tc to consume the entire switch
    buffer space. Nonetheless, the held frames are still there, and they
    reduce the total backplane capacity of the switch.

    However, after the aforementioned commit, the behavior can be very
    clearly seen, since we deliberately allow each {port, tc} to consume the
    entire shared buffer of the switch minus the reservations (and we
    disable all reservations by default). That is to say, we allow a
    permanently closed tc-taprio gate to hang the entire switch.

    A careful inspection of the documentation shows that the QSYS:Q_MAX_SDU
    per-port-tc registers serve 2 purposes: one is for guard band calculation
    (when zero, this falls back to QSYS:PORT_MAX_SDU), and the other is to
    enable oversized frame dropping (when non-zero).

    Currently the QSYS:Q_MAX_SDU registers are all zero, so oversized frame
    dropping is disabled. The goal of the change is to enable it seamlessly.
    For that, we need to hook into the MTU change, tc-taprio change, and
    port link speed change procedures, since we depend on these variables.

    Frames are not dropped on egress due to a queue system oversize
    condition, instead that egress port is simply excluded from the mask of
    valid destination ports for the packet. If there are no destination
    ports at all, the ingress counter that increments is the generic
    "drop_tail" in ethtool -S.

    The issue exists in various forms since the tc-taprio offload was introduced.

    net: dsa: felix: update base time of time-aware shaper when adjusting PTP time

    [ Upstream commit 8670dc33f48bab4d7bb4b8d0232f17f4dae419ec ]

    When adjusting the PTP clock, the base time of the TAS configuration
    will become unreliable. We need reset the TAS configuration by using a
    new base time.

    For example, if the driver gets a base time 0 of Qbv configuration from
    user, and current time is 20000. The driver will set the TAS base time
    to be 20000. After the PTP clock adjustment, the current time becomes
    10000. If the TAS base time is still 20000, it will be a future time,
    and TAS entry list will stop running. Another example, if the current
    time becomes to be 10000000 after PTP clock adjust, a large time offset
    can cause the hardware to hang.

    This patch introduces a tas_clock_adjust() function to reset the TAS
    module by using a new base time after the PTP clock adjustment. This can
    avoid issues above.

    Due to PTP clock adjustment can occur at any time, it may conflict with
    the TAS configuration. We introduce a new TAS lock to serialize the
    access to the TAS registers.

    selftests/xsk: Destroy BPF resources only when ctx refcount drops to 0

    [ Upstream commit 39e940d4abfabb08b6937a315546b24d10be67e3 ]

    Currently, xsk_socket__delete frees BPF resources regardless of ctx
    refcount. Xdpxceiver has a test to verify whether underlying BPF
    resources would not be wiped out after closing XSK socket that was
    bound to interface with other active sockets. From library's xsk part
    perspective it also means that the internal xsk context is shared and
    its refcount is bumped accordingly.

    After a switch to loading XDP prog based on previously opened XSK
    socket, mentioned xdpxceiver test fails with:

      not ok 16 [xdpxceiver.c:swap_xsk_resources:1334]: ERROR: 9/"Bad file descriptor

    which means that in swap_xsk_resources(), xsk_socket__delete() released
    xskmap which in turn caused a failure of xsk_socket__update_xskmap().

    To fix this, when deleting socket, decrement ctx refcount before
    releasing BPF resources and do so only when refcount dropped to 0 which
    means there are no more active sockets for this ctx so BPF resources can
    be freed safely.

    drm/vc4: hdmi: Move HDMI reset to pm_resume

    [ Upstream commit 467e30171b5b483922b1c24c573fa50787207cb6 ]

    The BCM2835-37 found in the RaspberryPi 0 to 3 have a power domain
    attached to the HDMI block, handled in Linux through runtime_pm.

    That power domain is shared with the VEC block, so even if we put our
    runtime_pm reference in the HDMI driver it would keep being on. If the
    VEC is disabled though, the power domain would be disabled and we would
    lose any initialization done in our bind implementation.

    That initialization involves calling the reset function and initializing
    the CEC registers.

    Let's move the initialization to our runtime_resume implementation so
    that we initialize everything properly if we ever need to.

    drm/vc4: hdmi: Switch to pm_runtime_status_suspended

    [ Upstream commit fcef97e70094a33ded73b3eb9bef06698c6e9c12 ]

    If the controller isn't clocked or its domain powered up, the register
    accesses will either stall the CPU or return garbage, respectively.

    Thus, we had a warning in our register access function to complain when
    that kind of risky accesses were performed.

    In order to check the runtime_pm power state, we were using
    pm_runtime_active(), but it turns out that it will become active only
    once the runtime_resume hook has been executed.

    This prevents us from doing any WARN-free register access in our
    runtime_resume() implementation, while this is valid.

    Let's switch to pm_runtime_status_suspended() instead.

    drm/vc4: dsi: Correct DSI divider calculations

    [ Upstream commit 3b45eee87da171caa28f61240ddb5c21170cda53 ]

    The divider calculations tried to find the divider just faster than the
    clock requested. However if it required a divider of 7 then the for loop
    aborted without handling the "error" case, and could end up with a clock
    lower than requested.

    The integer divider from parent PLL to DSI clock is also capable of
    going up to /255, not just /7 that the driver was trying.  This allows
    for slower link frequencies on the DSI bus where the resolution permits.

    Correct the loop so that we always have a clock greater than requested,
    and covering the whole range of dividers.

    [ Upstream commit 1701a23a4ef0993964ccc2f2d5d13f83a5ff4c70 ]

    The core clock computation takes into account both the load due to the
    input (ie, planes) and its output (ie, encoders).

    However, while the input load needs to consider all the planes, and thus
    sum all of their associated loads, the output happens mostly in
    parallel.

    Therefore, we need to consider only the maximum of all the output loads,
    and not the sum like we were doing. This resulted in a clock rate way
    too high which could be discarded for being too high by the clock
    framework.

    Since recent changes, the clock framework will even downright reject it,
    leading to a core clock being too low for its current needs.

    media: mediatek: vcodec: Skip SOURCE_CHANGE & EOS events for stateless

    [ Upstream commit e13ca460e20ed42fe57a3845b0bb9a82f81f05cd ]

    The stateless decoder API does not specify the usage of SOURCE_CHANGE
    and EOF events. These events are used by stateful decoders to signal
    changes in the bitstream. They do not make sense for stateless decoders.

    Do not handle subscription for these two types of events for stateless
    decoder instances. This fixes the last v4l2-compliance error:

    Control ioctls:
                    fail: v4l2-test-controls.cpp(946): have_source_change || have_eos

    media: sta2x11: remove VIRT_TO_BUS dependency

    [ Upstream commit a157802359f7451ed8046b2b6dbaca187797e062 ]

    This driver does not use the virt_to_bus() function, though it
    depends on x86 specific fixups in the swiotlb code, which was
    last rewritten in commit e380a0394c36 ("x86/PCI: sta2x11: use
    default DMA address translation").

    It is possible that the driver still fails to build on some
    architectures that are missing CONFIG_VIRT_TO_BUS, but it is
    always set on x86 machines with the STA2X11 platform enabled.

    More likely though is that it was never meant to depend on
    CONFIG_VIRT_TO_BUS, and the Kconfig dependency was kept from
    an out-of-tree version when the driver was originally merged.

    media: hdpvr: fix error value returns in hdpvr_read

    [ Upstream commit 359c27c6ddbde404f44a9c0d3ec88ccd1e2042f2 ]

    Error return values are supposed to be negative in hdpvr_read. Most
    error returns are currently handled via an unsigned integer "ret". When
    setting a negative error value to "ret", the value actually becomes a
    large positive value, because "ret" is unsigned. Later on, the "ret"
    value is returned. But as ssize_t is a 64-bit signed number, the error
    return value stays a large positive integer instead of a negative
    integer. This can cause an error value to be interpreted as the read
    size, which can cause a buffer overread for applications relying on the
    returned size.

    crypto: ccp - During shutdown, check SEV data pointer before using

    [ Upstream commit 1b05ece0c931536c0a38a9385e243a7962e933f6 ]

    On shutdown, each CCP device instance performs shutdown processing.
    However, __sev_platform_shutdown_locked() uses the controlling psp
    structure to obtain the pointer to the sev_device structure. However,
    during driver initialization, it is possible that an error can be received
    from the firmware that results in the sev_data pointer being cleared from
    the controlling psp structure. The __sev_platform_shutdown_locked()
    function does not check for this situation and will segfault.

    While not common, this scenario should be accounted for. Add a check for a
    NULL sev_device structure before attempting to use it.

    test_sock_fields__detach() got called with a null pointer here when one

    call resulted in a jump to the "done" label.

    A skeletons *__detach() is not safe to call with a null pointer, though.
    This led to a segfault.

    Go the easy route and only call test_sock_fields__destroy() which is
    null-pointer safe and includes detaching.

    Came across this while looking[1] to introduce the usage of
    bpf_tcp_helpers.h (included in progs/test_sock_fields.c) together with
    vmlinux.h.

    rcutorture: Fix ksoftirqd boosting timing and iteration

    [ Upstream commit 3002153a91a9732a6d1d0bb95138593c7da15743 ]

    The RCU priority boosting can fail in two situations:

    1) If (nr_cpus= > maxcpus=), which means if the total number of CPUs
    is higher than those brought online at boot, then torture_onoff() may
    later bring up CPUs that weren't online on boot. Now since rcutorture
    initialization only boosts the ksoftirqds of the CPUs that have been
    set online on boot, the CPUs later set online by torture_onoff won't
    benefit from the boost, making RCU priority boosting fail.

    2) The ksoftirqd kthreads are boosted after the creation of
    rcu_torture_boost() kthreads, which opens a window large enough for these
    rcu_torture_boost() kthreads to wait (despite running at FIFO priority)
    for ksoftirqds that are still running at SCHED_NORMAL priority.

    The issues can trigger for example with:

            ./kvm.sh --configs TREE01 --kconfig "CONFIG_RCU_BOOST=y"

    torture: Adjust to again produce debugging information

    [ Upstream commit 5c92d7501699a5deb72a579f808500db5bb6f92a ]

    A recent change to the DEBUG_INFO Kconfig option means that simply adding

    longer works.  It is instead necessary to add CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_NONE=n
    and (for example) CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF_TOOLCHAIN_DEFAULT=y.
    This combination will then result in CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO being selected.

    This commit therefore updates the Kconfig options produced in response

    of memory has increased recently, which results in frequent OOMs on a
    few of the rcutorture scenarios.  This commit therefore provides 2G of
    memory for --kasan runs, up from the 512M default.

    wifi: rtw89: 8852a: rfk: fix div 0 exception

    [ Upstream commit 683a4647a7a3044868cfdc14c117525091b9fa0c ]

    The DPK is a kind of RF calibration whose algorithm is to fine tune
    parameters and calibrate, and check the result. If the result isn't good
    enough, it could adjust parameters and try again.

    This issue is to read and show the result, but it could be a negative
    calibration result that causes divisor 0 and core dump. So, fix it by
    phy_div() that does division only if divisor isn't zero; otherwise,
    zero is adopted.

    [ Upstream commit a8eb8e6f7159c7c20c0ddac428bde3d110890aa7 ]

    As a result of the execution of the inner while loop, the value
    of 'idx' can be equal to LINK_QUAL_MAX_RETRY_NUM. However, this
    is not checked after the loop and 'idx' is used to write the
    LINK_QUAL_MAX_RETRY_NUM size array 'lq_cmd->rs_table[idx]' below
    in the outer loop.

    The fix is to check the new value of 'idx' inside the nested loop,
    and break both loops if index equals the size. Checking it at the
    start is now pointless, so let's remove it.

    Detected using the static analysis tool - Svace.

    ath9k: fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb

    [ Upstream commit 0ac4827f78c7ffe8eef074bc010e7e34bc22f533 ]

    Syzbot reported use-after-free Read in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb() [0]. The
    problem was in incorrect htc_handle->drv_priv initialization.

    Probable call trace which can trigger use-after-free:

    ath9k_htc_probe_device()
      /* htc_handle->drv_priv = priv; */
      ath9k_htc_wait_for_target()      <--- Failed

      ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream()
       RX_STAT_INC()                <--- htc_handle->drv_priv access

    In order to not add fancy protection for drv_priv we can move
    htc_handle->drv_priv initialization at the end of the
    ath9k_htc_probe_device() and add helper macro to make
    all *_STAT_* macros NULL safe, since syzbot has reported related NULL
    deref in that macros [1]

    [ Upstream commit 9e7aa76cdb02923ee23a0ddd48f38bdc3512f92b ]

    The hardware can support any image size WxH,
    with arbitrary W (image width) and H (image height) dimensions.

    Align upwards buffer size for both encoder and decoder.
    and leave the picture resolution unchanged.

    For decoder, the risk of memory out of bounds can be avoided.
    For both encoder and decoder, the driver will lift the limitation of
    resolution alignment.

    For example, the decoder can support jpeg whose resolution is 227x149
    the encoder can support nv12 1080P, won't change it to 1920x1072.

    [ Upstream commit fb730334e0f759d00f72168fbc555e5a95e35210 ]

    We got the following warning when booting the kernel:

    [    3.243922] The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe

    The lock 'vc->qlock' will be initialized in tw686x_video_init(), but the
    driver registers the irq before calling the tw686x_video_init(), and we
    got the warning.

    Fix this by registering the irq at the end of probe

    raw: convert raw sockets to RCU

    [ Upstream commit 0daf07e527095e64ee8927ce297ab626643e9f51 ]

    Using rwlock in networking code is extremely risky.
    writers can starve if enough readers are constantly
    grabing the rwlock.

    I thought rwlock were at fault and sent this patch:

    https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/6/17/272

    But Peter and Linus essentially told me rwlock had to be unfair.

    We need to get rid of rwlock in networking code.

    Without this fix, following script triggers soft lockups:

    for i in {1..48}

    tcp: fix possible freeze in tx path under memory pressure

    [ Upstream commit 849b425cd091e1804af964b771761cfbefbafb43 ]

    Blamed commit only dealt with applications issuing small writes.

    Issue here is that we allow to force memory schedule for the sk_buff
    allocation, but we have no guarantee that sendmsg() is able to
    copy some payload in it.

    In this patch, I make sure the socket can use up to tcp_wmem[0] bytes.

    For example, if we consider tcp_wmem[0] = 4096 (default on x86),
    and initial skb->truesize being 1280, tcp_sendmsg() is able to
    copy up to 2816 bytes under memory pressure.

    Before this patch a sendmsg() sending more than 2816 bytes
    would either block forever (if persistent memory pressure),
    or return -EAGAIN.

    For bigger MTU networks, it is advised to increase tcp_wmem[0]
    to avoid sending too small packets.

    v2: deal with zero copy paths.

    can: netlink: allow configuring of fixed data bit rates without need for do_set_data_bittiming callback

    [ Upstream commit ec30c109391c5eac9b1d689a61e4bfed88148947 ]

    This patch is similar to 7e193a42c37c ("can: netlink: allow
    configuring of fixed bit rates without need for do_set_bittiming
    callback") but for data bit rates instead of bit rates.

    Usually CAN devices support configurable data bit rates. The limits
    are defined by struct can_priv::data_bittiming_const. Another way is
    to implement the struct can_priv::do_set_data_bittiming callback.

    If the bit rate is configured via netlink, the can_changelink()
    function checks that either can_priv::data_bittiming_const or struct
    can_priv::do_set_data_bittiming is implemented.

    In commit 431af779256c ("can: dev: add CAN interface API for fixed
    bitrates") an API for configuring bit rates on CAN interfaces that
    only support fixed bit rates was added. The supported bit rates are
    defined by struct can_priv::bitrate_const.

    However the above mentioned commit forgot to add the struct
    can_priv::data_bitrate_const to the check in can_changelink().

    In order to avoid to implement a no-op can_priv::do_set_data_bittiming
    callback on devices with fixed data bit rates, extend the check in
    can_changelink() accordingly.

    drm: adv7511: override i2c address of cec before accessing it

    [ Upstream commit 9cc4853e4781bf0dd0f35355dc92d97c9da02f5d ]

    Commit 680532c50bca ("drm: adv7511: Add support for
    i2c_new_secondary_device") allows a device tree node to override
    the default addresses of the secondary i2c devices. This is useful
    for solving address conflicts on the i2c bus.

    In adv7511_init_cec_regmap() the new i2c address of cec device is
    read from device tree and immediately accessed, well before it is
    written in the proper register to override the default address.
    This can cause an i2c error during probe and a consequent probe
    failure.

    Once the new i2c address is read from the device tree, override
    the default address before any attempt to access the cec.

    Tested with adv7533 and stm32mp157f.

    drm/mediatek: Add pull-down MIPI operation in mtk_dsi_poweroff function

    [ Upstream commit fa5d0a0205c34734c5b8daa77e39ac2817f63a10 ]

    In the dsi_enable function, mtk_dsi_rxtx_control is to
    pull up the MIPI signal operation. Before dsi_disable,
    MIPI should also be pulled down by writing a register
    instead of disabling dsi.

    If disable dsi without pulling the mipi signal low, the value of
    the register will still maintain the setting of the mipi signal being
    pulled high.
    After resume, even if the mipi signal is not pulled high, it will still
    be in the high state.

    the poweron/poweroff of dsi is extracted from enable/disable and

    Since dsi_poweron is moved from dsi_enable to pre_enable function, in
    order to avoid poweron failure, the operation of dsi register fails to
    cause bus hang. Therefore, the protection mechanism is added to the
    dsi_enable function.

    Also, remove redundant last checks for 'j' index bigger than array size.
    The expression is always false. Moreover, before or after the patch

    ath11k: Avoid REO CMD failed prints during firmware recovery

    [ Upstream commit 0ab52b2bd7be8fd49c8ade7703c1faa15359c6c5 ]

    Currently when firmware recovery is in progress, we do not queue REO
    commands to the firmware, instead -ESHUTDOWN will be returned to the
    caller leading to a failure print on the console. The REO command in
    the problem scenario is sent for all tids of a peer in which case we
    will have 16 failure prints on the console for a single peer. For an
    AP usecase, this count would be even higher in a worst case scenario.
    Since these commands are bound to fail during firmware recovery, it
    is better to avoid printing these failures and thereby avoid message
    flooding on the console.

    selftests/bpf: Fix tc_redirect_dtime

    [ Upstream commit e6ff92f41b65fce07365f1066fb13b5e42aca08d ]

    tc_redirect_dtime was reported flaky from time to time.  It
    always fails at the udp test and complains about the bpf@tc-ingress
    got a skb->tstamp when handling udp packet.  It is unexpected
    because the skb->tstamp should have been cleared when crossing
    different netns.

    The most likely cause is that the skb is actually a tcp packet
    from the earlier tcp test.  It could be the final TCP_FIN handling.

    This patch tightens the skb->tstamp check in the bpf prog.  It ensures
    the skb is the current testing traffic.  First, it checks that skb
    matches the IPPROTO of the running test (i.e. tcp vs udp).
    Second, it checks the server port (dst_ns_port).  The server
    port is unique for each test (50000 + test_enum).

    Also fixed a typo in test_udp_dtime(): s/P100/P101/

    drm/mipi-dbi: align max_chunk to 2 in spi_transfer

    [ Upstream commit 435c249008cba04ed6a7975e9411f3b934620204 ]

    In __spi_validate, there's a validation that no partial transfers
    are accepted (xfer->len % w_size must be zero). When
    max_chunk is not a multiple of bpw (e.g. max_chunk = 65535,
    bpw = 16), the transfer will be rejected.

    This patch aligns max_chunk to 2 bytes (the maximum value of bpw is 16),
    so that no partial transfer will occur.

    ath11k: fix netdev open race

    This specifically avoids having a racing open() trigger a BUG_ON() in

    If the copy_from_user() fails or the user gives invalid date then the
    correct thing to do is to return a negative error code.  (Currently it
    returns success).

    I made a copy additional related cleanups:
    1) There is no need to check "buffer" for NULL.  That's handled by
    copy_from_user().
    2) The "h2c_len" variable cannot be negative because it is unsigned
    and because sscanf() does not return negative error codes.

    drm/st7735r: Fix module autoloading for Okaya RH128128T

    [ Upstream commit 9ad6f181ad9a19a26bda73a7b199df44ccfcdaba ]

    The SPI core always reports a "MODALIAS=spi:<foo>", even if the device was
    registered via OF. This means that the st7735r.ko module won't autoload if
    a DT has a node with a compatible "okaya,rh128128t" string.

    In that case, kmod expects a "MODALIAS=of:N*T*Cokaya,rh128128t" uevent but
    instead will get a "MODALIAS=spi:rh128128t", which is not present in the
    list of aliases:

      $ modinfo drivers/gpu/drm/tiny/st7735r.ko | grep alias
      alias:          of:N*T*Cokaya,rh128128tC*

      alias:          spi:jd-t18003-t01

    To workaround this issue, add in the SPI table an entry for that device.

    drm/bridge: lt9611: Use both bits for HDMI sensing

    [ Upstream commit 649eb3828fb22e829e222ebd83f4e11dc503a565 ]

    In commit 19cf41b64e3b ("lontium-lt9611: check a different
    register bit for HDMI sensing"), the bit flag used to detect
    HDMI cable connect was switched from BIT(2) to BIT(0) to improve
    compatibility with some monitors that didn't seem to set BIT(2).

    However, with that change, I've seen occasional issues where the
    detection failed, because BIT(2) was set, but not BIT(0).

    Unfortunately, as I understand it, the bits and their function
    was never clearly documented. So lets instead check both
    (BIT(2) | BIT(0)) when checking the register.

    ath10k: do not enforce interrupt trigger type

    Interrupt line can be configured on different hardware in different way,
    even inverted.  Therefore driver should not enforce specific trigger
    type - edge rising - but instead rely on Devicetree to configure it.

    All Qualcomm DTSI with WCN3990 define the interrupt type as level high,
    so the mismatch between DTSI and driver causes rebind issues:

            do_div(val, lpc18xx_pwm->clk_rate);
            lpc18xx_pwm->max_period_ns = val;

    is bogus because with NSEC_PER_SEC = 1000000000,
    LPC18XX_PWM_TIMER_MAX = 0xffffffff and clk_rate < NSEC_PER_SEC this
    overflows the (on lpc18xx (i.e. ARM32) 32 bit wide) unsigned int
    .max_period_ns. This results (dependant of the actual clk rate) in an
    arbitrary limitation of the maximal period.  E.g. for clkrate =
    333333333 (Hz) we get max_period_ns = 9 instead of 12884901897.

    So make .max_period_ns an u64 and pass period and duty as u64 to not
    discard relevant digits. And also make use of mul_u64_u64_div_u64()
    which prevents all overflows assuming clk_rate < NSEC_PER_SEC.

    nohz/full, sched/rt: Fix missed tick-reenabling bug in dequeue_task_rt()

    [ Upstream commit 5c66d1b9b30f737fcef85a0b75bfe0590e16b62a ]

    dequeue_task_rt() only decrements 'rt_rq->rt_nr_running' after having
    called sched_update_tick_dependency() preventing it from re-enabling the
    tick on systems that no longer have pending SCHED_RT tasks but have
    multiple runnable SCHED_OTHER tasks:

      dequeue_task_rt()
        dequeue_rt_entity()
          dequeue_rt_stack()
            dequeue_top_rt_rq()
              sub_nr_running()      // decrements rq->nr_running
                sched_update_tick_dependency()
                  sched_can_stop_tick()     // checks rq->rt.rt_nr_running,
                  ...
            __dequeue_rt_entity()
              dec_rt_tasks()        // decrements rq->rt.rt_nr_running
              ...

    Every other scheduler class performs the operation in the opposite
    order, and sched_update_tick_dependency() expects the values to be
    updated as such. So avoid the misbehaviour by inverting the order in
    which the above operations are performed in the RT scheduler.

    drivers/perf: arm_spe: Fix consistency of SYS_PMSCR_EL1.CX

    [ Upstream commit 92f2b8bafa3d6e89c750e9d301a8b7ab76aaa8b6 ]

    The arm_spe_pmu driver will enable SYS_PMSCR_EL1.CX in order to add CONTEXT
    packets into the traces, if the owner of the perf event runs with required
    capabilities i.e CAP_PERFMON or CAP_SYS_ADMIN via perfmon_capable() helper.

    The value of this bit is computed in the arm_spe_event_to_pmscr() function
    but the check for capabilities happens in the pmu event init callback i.e
    arm_spe_pmu_event_init(). This suggests that the value of the CX bit should
    remain consistent for the duration of the perf session.

    However, the function arm_spe_event_to_pmscr() may be called later during
    the event start callback i.e arm_spe_pmu_start() when the "current" process
    is not the owner of the perf session, hence the CX bit setting is currently
    not consistent.

    One way to fix this, is by caching the required value of the CX bit during
    the initialization of the PMU event, so that it remains consistent for the
    duration of the session. It uses currently unused 'event->hw.flags' element
    to cache perfmon_capable() value, which can be referred during event start
    callback to compute SYS_PMSCR_EL1.CX. This ensures consistent availability
    of context packets in the trace as per event owner capabilities.

    Drop BIT(SYS_PMSCR_EL1_CX_SHIFT) check in arm_spe_pmu_event_init(), because
    now CX bit cannot be set in arm_spe_event_to_pmscr() with perfmon_capable()
    disabled.

    it lacks the regulator supplies that should be added in the board DT
    files. Some of the msm8974 boards are currently missing the regulator
    supplies and should have the remoteprocs disabled to avoid making use
    of the incomplete configuration.

    This also fixes dtbs_check warnings after moving "qcom,msm8974-mss-pil"
    to DT schema, which rightfully complains that the -supply properties
    are missing for some boards:

    arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404: Fix incorrect USB2 PHYs assignment

    [ Upstream commit 58577966a42fc0b660b5e2c7c9e5a2241363ea83 ]

    Currently the DT for QCS404 SoC has setup for 2 USB2 PHYs with one each
    assigned to USB3 controller and USB2 controller. This assignment is
    incorrect which only works by luck: as when each USB HCI comes up it
    configures the *other* controllers PHY which is enough to make them
    happy. If, for any reason, we were to disable one of the controllers then
    both would stop working.

    This was a difficult inconsistency to be caught which was found while
    trying to enable USB support in u-boot. So with all the required drivers
    ported to u-boot, I couldn't get the same USB storage device enumerated
    in u-boot which was being enumerated fine by the kernel.

    The root cause of the problem came out to be that I wasn't enabling USB2
    PHY: "usb2_phy_prim" in u-boot. Then I realised that via simply disabling
    the same USB2 PHY currently assigned to USB2 host controller in the
    kernel disabled enumeration for USB3 host controller as well.

    So fix this inconsistency by correctly assigning USB2 PHYs.

    These voltages are not a multiple of the given step-size 8000 (with base

    PM: domains: Ensure genpd_debugfs_dir exists before remove

    [ Upstream commit 37101d3c719386040ded735a5ec06974f1d94d1f ]

    Both genpd_debug_add() and genpd_debug_remove() may be called
    indirectly by other drivers while genpd_debugfs_dir is not yet
    set. For example, drivers can call pm_genpd_init() in probe or
    pm_genpd_init() in probe fail/cleanup path:

    pm_genpd_init()
     --> genpd_debug_add()

    pm_genpd_remove()
     --> genpd_remove()
       --> genpd_debug_remove()

    At this time, genpd_debug_init() may not yet be called.

    genpd_debug_add() checks that if genpd_debugfs_dir is NULL, it
    will return directly. Make sure this is also checked
    in pm_genpd_remove(), otherwise components under debugfs root
    which has the same name as other components under pm_genpd may
    be accidentally removed, since NULL represents debugfs root.

    spi: Return deferred probe error when controller isn't yet available

    [ Upstream commit 9c22ec4ac27bcc5a54dd406da168f403327a5b55 ]

    If the controller is not available, it might be in the future and
    we would like to re-probe the peripheral again. For that purpose
    return deferred probe.

    erofs: avoid consecutive detection for Highmem memory

    [ Upstream commit 448b5a1548d87c246c3d0c3df8480d3c6eb6c11a ]

    Currently, vmap()s are avoided if physical addresses are
    consecutive for decompressed buffers.

    I observed that is very common for 4KiB pclusters since the
    numbers of decompressed pages are almost 2 or 3.

    However, such detection doesn't work for Highmem pages on
    32-bit machines, let's fix it now.

    erofs: wake up all waiters after z_erofs_lzma_head ready

    [ Upstream commit 2df7c4bd7c1d2bc5ece5e9ed19dbd386810c2a65 ]

    When the user mounts the erofs second times, the decompression thread
    may hung. The problem happens due to a sequence of steps like the
    following:

    1) Task A called z_erofs_load_lzma_config which obtain all of the node
       from the z_erofs_lzma_head.

    2) At this time, task B called the z_erofs_lzma_decompress and wanted to
       get a node. But the z_erofs_lzma_head was empty, the Task B had to
       sleep.

    3) Task A release nodes and push nodes into the z_erofs_lzma_head. But
       task B was still sleeping.

    One example report when the hung happens:

    arm64: tegra: Mark BPMP channels as no-memory-wc

    [ Upstream commit 61192a9d8a6367ae1b8234876941b037910a2459 ]

    The Tegra SYSRAM contains regions access to which is restricted to
    certain hardware blocks on the system, and speculative accesses to
    those will cause issues.

    Patch 'misc: sram: Only map reserved areas in Tegra SYSRAM' attempted
    to resolve this by only mapping the regions specified in the device
    tree on the assumption that there are no such restricted areas within
    the 64K-aligned area of memory that contains the memory we wish to map.

    Turns out this assumption is wrong, as there are such areas above the
    4K pages described in the device trees. As such, we need to use the
    bigger hammer that is no-memory-wc, which causes the memory to be
    mapped as Device memory to which speculative accesses are disallowed.

    As such, the previous patch in the series,
      'firmware: tegra: bpmp: do only aligned access to IPC memory area',
    is required with this patch to make the BPMP driver only issue aligned
    memory accesses as those are also required with Device memory.

    arm64: dts: mt7622: fix BPI-R64 WPS button

    [ Upstream commit c98e6e683632386a3bd284acda4342e68aec4c41 ]

    The bananapi R64 (BPI-R64) experiences wrong WPS button signals.
    In OpenWrt pushing the WPS button while powering on the device will set
    it to recovery mode. Currently, this also happens without any user
    interaction. In particular, the wrong signals appear while booting the
    device or restarting it, e.g. after doing a system upgrade. If the
    device is in recovery mode the user needs to manually power cycle or
    restart it.

    The official BPI-R64 sources set the WPS button to GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW in
    the device tree. This setting seems to suppress the unwanted WPS button
    press signals. So this commit changes the button from GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH to
    GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW.

    The official BPI-R64 sources can be found on
    https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-R64-openwrt

    [ Upstream commit 6990640a93ba4e76dd62ca3ea1082a7354db09d7 ]

    Both the sdc2-on and sdc2-off pinctrl nodes are used by the
    sdhci@4784000 node in sm6125.dtsi.  Surprisingly sdc2-off is defined in
    sm6125, yet its sdc2-on counterpart is only defined in board-specific DT
    for the Sony Seine PDX201 board/device resulting in an "undefined label
    &sdc2_state_on" error if sm6125.dtsi were included elsewhere.
    This sm6125 base dtsi should not rely on externally defined labels; the
    properties referencing it should then also be written externally.
    Since the sdc2-on pin configuration is board-independent just like
    sdc2-off, move it from seine-pdx201.dts into sm6125.dtsi.

    The SDCard-detect pin (gpio98) is however board-specific, and remains as
    an overwrite in seine-pdx201.dts for both the on and off state.

    As a drive-by cleanup, reorder bias- and drive-strength properties.

    ACPI: VIOT: Fix ACS setup

    [ Upstream commit 3dcb861dbc6ab101838a1548b1efddd00ca3c3ec ]

    Currently acpi_viot_init() gets called after the pci
    device has been scanned and pci_enable_acs() has been called.
    So pci_request_acs() fails to be taken into account leading
    to wrong single iommu group topologies when dealing with
    multi-function root ports for instance.

    We cannot simply move the acpi_viot_init() earlier, similarly
    as the IORT init because the VIOT parsing relies on the pci
    scan. However we can detect VIOT is present earlier and in
    such a case, request ACS. Introduce a new acpi_viot_early_init()
    routine that allows to call pci_request_acs() before the scan.

    While at it, guard the call to pci_request_acs() with #ifdef
    CONFIG_PCI.

    lib: overflow: Do not define 64-bit tests on 32-bit

    [ Upstream commit 6a022dd29f2cefbac4895a34e2e1f14b2d12d819 ]

    The 64-bit overflow tests will trigger 64-bit division on 32-bit hosts,
    which is not currently used anywhere in the kernel, and tickles bugs
    in at least Clang 13 and earlier:
    https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1636

    In reality, there shouldn't be a reason to not build the 64-bit test
    cases on 32-bit systems, so these #ifdefs can be removed once the minimum
    Clang version reaches 13.

    In the meantime, silence W=1 warnings given by the current code:

    kbuild: Fix include path in scripts/Makefile.modpost

    [ Upstream commit 23a0cb8e3225122496bfa79172005c587c2d64bf ]

    When building an external module, if users don't need to separate the
    compilation output and source code, they run the following command:
    "make -C $(LINUX_SRC_DIR) M=$(PWD)". At this point, "$(KBUILD_EXTMOD)"
    and "$(src)" are the same.

    If they need to separate them, they run "make -C $(KERNEL_SRC_DIR)
    O=$(KERNEL_OUT_DIR) M=$(OUT_DIR) src=$(PWD)". Before running the
    command, they need to copy "Kbuild" or "Makefile" to "$(OUT_DIR)" to
    prevent compilation failure.

    So the kernel should change the included path to avoid the copy operation.

    rename DSI PHY label to match newer DTs, use tabs where possible,
    unwrap lines where wrapping is not necessary and don't disable mdp,

    regulator: qcom_smd: Fix pm8916_pldo range

    [ Upstream commit e8977917e116d1571dacb8e9864474551c1c12bd ]

    The PM8916 device specification [1] documents a programmable range of
    1.75V to 3.337V with 12.5mV steps for the PMOS LDOs in PM8916. This
    range is also used when controlling the regulator directly using the
    qcom_spmi-regulator driver ("ult_pldo" there).

    However, for some reason the qcom_smd-regulator driver allows a much
    larger range for the same hardware component. This could be simply a
    typo, since the start of the range is essentially just missing a '1'.

    In practice this does not cause any major problems, since the driver
    just sends the actual voltage to the RPM firmware instead of making use
    of the incorrect voltage selector. Still, having the wrong range there
    is confusing and prevents the regulator core from validating requests
    correctly.

    success, and the bio will never fill from the unadvancing iov_iter. We
    could turn the return into an error value, but it will already be turned
    into an error value later on, so just remove the warning. Clearly no one
    ever hit it anyway.

    arm64: cpufeature: Allow different PMU versions in ID_DFR0_EL1

    [ Upstream commit 506506cad3947b942425b119ffa2b06715d5d804 ]

    Commit b20d1ba3cf4b ("arm64: cpufeature: allow for version discrepancy in
    PMU implementations") made it possible to run Linux on a machine with PMUs
    with different versions without tainting the kernel. The patch relaxed the
    restriction only for the ID_AA64DFR0_EL1.PMUVer field, and missed doing the
    same for ID_DFR0_EL1.PerfMon , which also reports the PMU version, but for
    the AArch32 state.

    For example, with Linux running on two clusters with different PMU
    versions, the kernel is tainted when bringing up secondaries with the
    following message:

    [    0.097027] smp: Bringing up secondary CPUs ...

    The boot CPU implements FEAT_PMUv3p1 (ID_DFR0_EL1.PerfMon, bits 27:24, is
    0b0100), but CPU4, part of the other cluster, implements FEAT_PMUv3p4
    (ID_DFR0_EL1.PerfMon = 0b0101).

    Treat the PerfMon field as FTR_NONSTRICT and FTR_EXACT to pass the sanity
    check and to match how PMUVer is treated for the 64bit ID register.

    arm64: select TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT

    [ Upstream commit 3381da254fab37ba08c4b7c4f19b4ee28b1a27ec ]

    Due to an oversight, on arm64 lockdep IRQ state tracking doesn't work as
    intended in NMI context. This demonstrably results in bogus warnings
    from lockdep, and in theory could mask a variety of issues.

    On arm64, we've consistently tracked IRQ flag state for NMIs (and
    saved/restored the state of the interrupted context) since commit:

      f0cd5ac1e4c53cb6 ("arm64: entry: fix NMI {user, kernel}->kernel transitions")

    That commit fixed most lockdep issues with NMI by virtue of the
    save/restore of the lockdep state of the interrupted context. However,
    for lockdep IRQ state tracking to consistently take effect in NMI
    context it has been necessary to select TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT since
    commit:

      ed00495333ccc80f ("locking/lockdep: Fix TRACE_IRQFLAGS vs. NMIs")

    As arm64 does not select TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT, this means that the
    lockdep state can be stale in NMI context, and some uses of that state
    can consume stale data.

    When an NMI is taken arm64 entry code will call arm64_enter_nmi(). This
    will enter NMI context via __nmi_enter() before calling
    lockdep_hardirqs_off() to inform lockdep that IRQs have been masked.
    Where TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT is not selected, lockdep_hardirqs_off()
    will not update lockdep state if called in NMI context. Thus if IRQs
    were enabled in the original context, lockdep will continue to believe
    that IRQs are enabled despite the call to lockdep_hardirqs_off().

    However, the lockdep_assert_*() checks do take effect in NMI context,
    and will consume the stale lockdep state. If an NMI is taken from a
    context which had IRQs enabled, and during the handling of the NMI
    something calls lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled(), this will result in a
    spurious warning based upon the stale lockdep state.

    This can be seen when using perf with GICv3 pseudo-NMIs. Within the perf
    NMI handler we may attempt a uaccess to record the userspace callchain,
    and is this faults the el1_abort() call in the nested context will call
    exit_to_kernel_mode() when returning, which has a
    lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled() assertion:

    Note that as lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled() uses WARN_ON_ONCE(), and
    this uses a BRK, the warning is logged with the real PSTATE at the time
    of the warning, which clearly has DAIF.I set, meaning IRQs (and
    pseudo-NMIs) were definitely masked and the warning is spurious.

    Fix this by selecting TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT such that the existing
    entry tracking takes effect, as we had originally intended when the
    arm64 entry code was fixed for transitions to/from NMI.

    Arguably the lockdep_assert_*() functions should have the same NMI
    checks as the rest of the code to prevent spurious warnings when
    TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT is not selected, but the real fix for any
    architecture is to explicitly handle the transitions to/from NMI in the
    entry code.

    Commit 6727ad9e206c ("nmi_backtrace: generate one-line reports for idle cpus")
    introduced a new text section called cpuidle; with that, we have a mechanism
    to add idling functions in such section and skip them from nmi_backtrace
    output, since they're useless and potentially flooding for such report.

    Happens that inlining might cause some real idle functions to end-up
    outside of such section; this is currently the case of ACPI processor_idle
    driver; the functions acpi_idle_enter_* do inline acpi_idle_do_entry(),
    hence they stay out of the cpuidle section.
    Fix that by marking such functions to also live in the cpuidle section.

    ARM: findbit: fix overflowing offset

    [ Upstream commit ec85bd369fd2bfaed6f45dd678706429d4f75b48 ]

    When offset is larger than the size of the bit array, we should not
    attempt to access the array as we can perform an access beyond the
    end of the array. Fix this by changing the pre-condition.

    Using "cmp r2, r1; bhs ..." covers us for the size == 0 case, since
    this will always take the branch when r1 is zero, irrespective of
    the value of r2. This means we can fix this bug without adding any
    additional code!

    RSPI IP on RZ/{A, G2L} SoC's has the same signal for both interrupt
    and DMA transfer request. Setting DMARS register for DMA transfer
    makes the signal to work as a DMA transfer request signal and
    subsequent interrupt requests to the interrupt controller
    are masked.

    PIO fallback does not work as interrupt signal is disabled.

    powerpc/64s: Disable stack variable initialisation for prom_init

    [ Upstream commit be640317a1d0b9cf42fedb2debc2887a7cfa38de ]

    With GCC 12 allmodconfig prom_init fails to build:

      Error: External symbol 'memset' referenced from prom_init.c
      make[2]: *** [arch/powerpc/kernel/Makefile:204: arch/powerpc/kernel/prom_init_check] Error 1

    The allmodconfig build enables KASAN, so all calls to memset in
    prom_init should be converted to __memset by the #ifdefs in
    asm/string.h, because prom_init must use the non-KASAN instrumented
    versions.

    The build failure happens because there's a call to memset that hasn't
    been caught by the pre-processor and converted to __memset. Typically
    that's because it's a memset generated by the compiler itself, and that
    is the case here.

    With GCC 12, allmodconfig enables CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_PATTERN, which
    causes the compiler to emit memset calls to initialise on-stack
    variables with a pattern.

    Because prom_init is non-user-facing boot-time only code, as a
    workaround just disable stack variable initialisation to unbreak the
    build.

    pinctrl: Don't allow PINCTRL_AMD to be a module

    [ Upstream commit 41ef3c1a6bb0fd4a3f81170dd17de3adbff80783 ]

    It was observed that by allowing pinctrl_amd to be loaded
    later in the boot process that interrupts sent to the GPIO
    controller early in the boot are not serviced.  The kernel treats
    these as a spurious IRQ and disables the IRQ.

    This problem was exacerbated because it happened on a system with
    an encrypted partition so the kernel object was not accesssible for
    an extended period of time while waiting for a passphrase.

    To avoid this situation from occurring, stop allowing pinctrl-amd
    from being built as a module and instead require it to be built-in
    or disabled.

    PM: hibernate: defer device probing when resuming from hibernation

    [ Upstream commit 8386c414e27caba8501119948e9551e52b527f59 ]

    syzbot is reporting hung task at misc_open() [1], for there is a race
    window of AB-BA deadlock which involves probe_count variable. Currently
    wait_for_device_probe() from snapshot_open() from misc_open() can sleep
    forever with misc_mtx held if probe_count cannot become 0.

    When a device is probed by hub_event() work function, probe_count is
    incremented before the probe function starts, and probe_count is
    decremented after the probe function completed.

    There are three cases that can prevent probe_count from dropping to 0.

      (a) A device being probed stopped responding (i.e. broken/malicious
          hardware).

      (b) A process emulating a USB device using /dev/raw-gadget interface
          stopped responding for some reason.

      (c) New device probe requests keeps coming in before existing device
          probe requests complete.

    The phenomenon syzbot is reporting is (b). A process which is holding
    system_transition_mutex and misc_mtx is waiting for probe_count to become
    0 inside wait_for_device_probe(), but the probe function which is called
     from hub_event() work function is waiting for the processes which are
    blocked at mutex_lock(&misc_mtx) to respond via /dev/raw-gadget interface.

    This patch mitigates (b) by deferring wait_for_device_probe() from
    snapshot_open() to snapshot_write() and snapshot_ioctl(). Please note that
    the possibility of (b) remains as long as any thread which is emulating a
    USB device via /dev/raw-gadget interface can be blocked by uninterruptible
    blocking operations (e.g. mutex_lock()).

    Please also note that (a) and (c) are not addressed. Regarding (c), we
    should change the code to wait for only one device which contains the
    image for resuming from hibernation. I don't know how to address (a), for
    use of timeout for wait_for_device_probe() might result in loss of user
    data in the image. Maybe we should require the userland to wait for the
    image device before opening /dev/snapshot interface.

    hwmon: (sht15) Fix wrong assumptions in device remove callback

    [ Upstream commit 7d4edccc9bbfe1dcdff641343f7b0c6763fbe774 ]

    Taking a lock at the beginning of .remove() doesn't prevent new readers.
    With the existing approach it can happen, that a read occurs just when
    the lock was taken blocking the reader until the lock is released at the
    end of the remove callback which then accessed *data that is already
    freed then.

    To actually fix this problem the hwmon core needs some adaption. Until
    this is implemented take the optimistic approach of assuming that all
    readers are gone after hwmon_device_unregister() and
    sysfs_remove_group() as most other drivers do. (And once the core
    implements that, taking the lock would deadlock.)

    So drop the lock, move the reset to after device unregistration to keep
    the device in a workable state until it's deregistered. Also add a error
    message in case the reset fails and return 0 anyhow. (Returning an error
    code, doesn't stop the platform device unregistration and only results
    in a little helpful error message before the devm cleanup handlers are
    called.)

    ACPI: video: Use native backlight on Dell Inspiron N4010

    [ Upstream commit 03c440a26cba6cfa540d65924e9db86fcea362b2 ]

    The Dell Inspiron N4010 does not have ACPI backlight control,
    so acpi_video_get_backlight_type()'s heuristics return vendor as
    the type to use.

    But the vendor interface is broken, where as the native (intel_backlight)
    works well, add a quirk to use native.

    ACPI: EC: Drop the EC_FLAGS_IGNORE_DSDT_GPE quirk

    [ Upstream commit f7090e0ef360d674f08a22fab90e4e209fb1f658 ]

    It seems that these quirks are no longer necessary since
    commit 69b957c26b32 ("ACPI: EC: Fix possible issues related to EC
    initialization order"), which has fixed this in a generic manner.

    There are 3 commits adding DMI entries with this quirk (adding multiple
    DMI entries per commit). 2/3 commits are from before the generic fix.

    Which leaves commit 6306f0431914 ("ACPI: EC: Make more Asus laptops
    use ECDT _GPE"), which was committed way after the generic fix.
    But this was just due to slow upstreaming of it. This commit stems
    from Endless from 15 Aug 2017 (committed upstream 20 May 2021):
    https://github.com/endlessm/linux/pull/288

    The current code should work fine without this:

     1. The EC_FLAGS_IGNORE_DSDT_GPE flag is only checked in ec_parse_device(),
        like this:

            if (boot_ec && boot_ec_is_ecdt && EC_FLAGS_IGNORE_DSDT_GPE) {
                    ec->gpe = boot_ec->gpe;
            } else {
                    /* parse GPE */
            }

     2. ec_parse_device() is only called from acpi_ec_add() and
        acpi_ec_dsdt_probe()

     3. acpi_ec_dsdt_probe() starts with:

            if (boot_ec)
                    return;

        so it only calls ec_parse_device() when boot_ec == NULL, meaning that
        the quirk never triggers for this call. So only the call in
        acpi_ec_add() matters.

     4. acpi_ec_add() does the following after the ec_parse_device() call:

            if (boot_ec && ec->command_addr == boot_ec->command_addr &&
                ec->data_addr == boot_ec->data_addr &&
                !EC_FLAGS_TRUST_DSDT_GPE) {
                    /*
                     * Trust PNP0C09 namespace location rather than
                     * ECDT ID. But trust ECDT GPE rather than _GPE
                     * because of ASUS quirks, so do not change
                     * boot_ec->gpe to ec->gpe.
                     */
                    boot_ec->handle = ec->handle;
                    acpi_handle_debug(ec->handle, "duplicated.\n");
                    acpi_ec_free(ec);
                    ec = boot_ec;
            }

    The quirk only matters if boot_ec != NULL and EC_FLAGS_TRUST_DSDT_GPE
    is never set at the same time as EC_FLAGS_IGNORE_DSDT_GPE.

    That means that if the addresses match we always enter this if block and
    then only the ec->handle part of the data stored in ec by ec_parse_device()
    is used and the rest is thrown away, after which ec is made to point
    to boot_ec, at which point ec->gpe == boot_ec->gpe, so the same result
    as with the quirk set, independent of the value of the quirk.

    Also note the comment in this block which indicates that the gpe result
    from ec_parse_device() is deliberately not taken to deal with buggy
    Asus laptops and all DMI quirks setting EC_FLAGS_IGNORE_DSDT_GPE are for
    Asus laptops.

    Based on the above I believe that unless on some quirked laptops
    the ECDT and DSDT EC addresses do not match we can drop the quirk.

    I've checked dmesg output to ensure the ECDT and DSDT EC addresses match
    for quirked models using https://linux-hardware.org hw-probe reports.

    I've been able to confirm that the addresses match for the following
    models this way: GL702VMK, X505BA, X505BP, X550VXK, X580VD.
    Whereas for the following models I could find any dmesg output:
    FX502VD, FX502VE, X542BA, X542BP.

    Note the models without dmesg all were submitted in patches with a batch
    of models and other models from the same batch checkout ok.

    This, combined with that all the code adding the quirks was written before
    the generic fix makes me believe that it is safe to remove this quirk now.

    arm64: dts: qcom: timer should use only 32-bit size

    [ Upstream commit 458ebdbb8e5d596a462d8125cec74142ff5dfa97 ]

    There's no reason the timer needs > 32-bits of address or size.
    Since we using 32-bit size, we need to define ranges properly.

    Fixes warnings as:

    Meraki MR26 is an EOL wireless access point featuring a

    SERIAL:
          WARNING: The serial port needs a TTL/RS-232 3V3 level converter!
          The Serial setting is 115200-8-N-1. The board has a populated
          right angle 1x4 0.1" pinheader.
          The pinout is: VCC (next to J3, has the pin 1 indicator), RX, TX, GND.

    Odd stuff:

    - uboot does not support lzma compression, but gzip'd uImage/DTB work.
    - uboot claims to support FIT, but fails to pass the DTB to the kernel.
      Appending the dtb after the kernel image works.
    - RGB-controller is supported through an external userspace program.
    - The ubi partition contains a "board-config" volume. It stores the
      MAC Address (0x66 in binary) and Serial No. (0x7c alpha-numerical).
    - SoC's temperature sensor always reports that it is on fire.
      This causes the system to immediately shutdown! Looking at reported
      "418 degree Celsius" suggests that this sensor is not working.

    wait: Fix __wait_event_hrtimeout for RT/DL tasks

    [ Upstream commit cceeeb6a6d02e7b9a74ddd27a3225013b34174aa ]

    Changes to hrtimer mode (potentially made by __hrtimer_init_sleeper on
    PREEMPT_RT) are not visible to hrtimer_start_range_ns, thus not
    accounted for by hrtimer_start_expires call paths. In particular,
    __wait_event_hrtimeout suffers from this problem as we have, for
    example:

    fs/aio.c::read_events
      wait_event_interruptible_hrtimeout
        __wait_event_hrtimeout
          hrtimer_init_sleeper_on_stack <- this might "mode |= HRTIMER_MODE_HARD"
                                           on RT if task runs at RT/DL priority
            hrtimer_start_range_ns
              WARN_ON_ONCE(!(mode & HRTIMER_MODE_HARD) ^ !timer->is_hard)
              fires since the latter doesn't see the change of mode done by
              init_sleeper

    Fix it by making __wait_event_hrtimeout call hrtimer_sleeper_start_expires,
    which is aware of the special RT/DL case, instead of hrtimer_start_range_ns.

    Here the kworker is waiting on msdos_sb_info::s_lock which is held by
    tar which is in turn waiting for a buffer which is locked waiting to be
    flushed, but this operation is plugged in the kworker.

    The lock is a normal struct mutex, so tsk_is_pi_blocked() will always
    return false on !RT and thus the behaviour changes for RT.

    It seems that the intent here is to skip blk_flush_plug() in the case
    where a non-preemptible lock (such as a spinlock) has been converted to
    a rtmutex on RT, which is the case covered by the SM_RTLOCK_WAIT
    schedule flag.  But sched_submit_work() is only called from schedule()
    which is never called in this scenario, so the check can simply be
    deleted.

    Looking at the history of the -rt patchset, in fact this change was
    present from v5.9.1-rt20 until being dropped in v5.13-rt1 as it was part
    of a larger patch [1] most of which was replaced by commit b4bfa3fcfe3b
    ("sched/core: Rework the __schedule() preempt argument").

    As described in [1]:

       The schedule process must distinguish between blocking on a regular
       sleeping lock (rwsem and mutex) and a RT-only sleeping lock (spinlock
       and rwlock):
       - rwsem and mutex must flush block requests (blk_schedule_flush_plug())
         even if blocked on a lock. This can not deadlock because this also
         happens for non-RT.
         There should be a warning if the scheduling point is within a RCU read
         section.

       - spinlock and rwlock must not flush block requests. This will deadlock
         if the callback attempts to acquire a lock which is already acquired.
         Similarly to being preempted, there should be no warning if the
         scheduling point is within a RCU read section.

    and with the tsk_is_pi_blocked() in the scheduler path, we hit the first
    issue.

    sched/fair: fix case with reduced capacity CPU

    [ Upstream commit c82a69629c53eda5233f13fc11c3c01585ef48a2 ]

    The capacity of the CPU available for CFS tasks can be reduced because of
    other activities running on the latter. In such case, it's worth trying to
    move CFS tasks on a CPU with more available capacity.

    The rework of the load balance has filtered the case when the CPU is
    classified to be fully busy but its capacity is reduced.

    Check if CPU's capacity is reduced while gathering load balance statistic
    and classify it group_misfit_task instead of group_fully_busy so we can
    try to move the load on another CPU.

    [ Upstream commit 0f5209fee90b4544c58b4278d944425292789967 ]

    The generic IPI code depends on the IRQ affinity mask being allocated
    and initialized. This will not be the case if SMP is disabled. Fix up
    the remaining driver that selected GENERIC_IRQ_IPI in a non-SMP config.

    irqchip/mips-gic: Only register IPI domain when SMP is enabled

    [ Upstream commit 8190cc572981f2f13b6ffc26c7cfa7899e5d3ccc ]

    The MIPS GIC irqchip driver may be selected in a uniprocessor
    configuration, but it unconditionally registers an IPI domain.

    Limit the part of the driver dealing with IPIs to only be compiled when
    GENERIC_IRQ_IPI is enabled, which corresponds to an SMP configuration.

    sched/fair: Introduce SIS_UTIL to search idle CPU based on sum of util_avg

    [ Upstream commit 70fb5ccf2ebb09a0c8ebba775041567812d45f86 ]

    [Problem Statement]
    select_idle_cpu() might spend too much time searching for an idle CPU,
    when the system is overloaded.

    The following histogram is the time spent in select_idle_cpu(),
    when running 224 instances of netperf on a system with 112 CPUs
    per LLC domain:

    The time spent in select_idle_cpu() is visible to netperf and might have a negative
    impact.

    [Symptom analysis]
    The patch [1] from Mel Gorman has been applied to track the efficiency
    of select_idle_sibling. Copy the indicators here:

    SIS Search Efficiency(se_eff%):
            A ratio expressed as a percentage of runqueues scanned versus
            idle CPUs found. A 100% efficiency indicates that the target,
            prev or recent CPU of a task was idle at wakeup. The lower the
            efficiency, the more runqueues were scanned before an idle CPU
            was found.

    SIS Domain Search Efficiency(dom_eff%):
            Similar, except only for the slower SIS
            patch.

    SIS Fast Success Rate(fast_rate%):
            Percentage of SIS that used target, prev or
            recent CPUs.

    SIS Success rate(success_rate%):
            Percentage of scans that found an idle CPU.

    The test is based on Aubrey's schedtests tool, including netperf, hackbench,
    schbench and tbench.

    According to the test above, if the system becomes busy, the
    SIS Search Efficiency(se_eff%) drops significantly. Although some
    benchmarks would finally find an idle CPU(success_rate% = 100%), it is
    doubtful whether it is worth it to search the whole LLC domain.

    [Proposal]
    It would be ideal to have a crystal ball to answer this question:
    How many CPUs must a wakeup path walk down, before it can find an idle
    CPU? Many potential metrics could be used to predict the number.
    One candidate is the sum of util_avg in this LLC domain. The benefit
    of choosing util_avg is that it is a metric of accumulated historic
    activity, which seems to be smoother than instantaneous metrics
    (such as rq->nr_running). Besides, choosing the sum of util_avg
    would help predict the load of the LLC domain more precisely, because
    SIS_PROP uses one CPU's idle time to estimate the total LLC domain idle
    time.

    In summary, the lower the util_avg is, the more select_idle_cpu()
    should scan for idle CPU, and vice versa. When the sum of util_avg
    in this LLC domain hits 85% or above, the scan stops. The reason to
    choose 85% as the threshold is that this is the imbalance_pct(117)
    when a LLC sched group is overloaded.

    Introduce the quadratic function:

    y = SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE - p * x^2
    and y'= y / SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE

    x is the ratio of sum_util compared to the CPU capacity:
    x = sum_util / (llc_weight * SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE)
    y' is the ratio of CPUs to be scanned in the LLC domain,
    and the number of CPUs to scan is calculated by:

    nr_scan = llc_weight * y'

    Choosing quadratic function is because:
    [1] Compared to the linear function, it scans more aggressively when the
        sum_util is low.
    [2] Compared to the exponential function, it is easier to calculate.
    [3] It seems that there is no accurate mapping between the sum of util_avg
        and the number of CPUs to be scanned. Use heuristic scan for now.

    For a platform with 112 CPUs per LLC, the number of CPUs to scan is:
    sum_util%   0    5   15   25  35  45  55   65   75   85   86 ...
    scan_nr   112  111  108  102  93  81  65   47   25    1    0 ...

    For a platform with 16 CPUs per LLC, the number of CPUs to scan is:
    sum_util%   0    5   15   25  35  45  55   65   75   85   86 ...
    scan_nr    16   15   15   14  13  11   9    6    3    0    0 ...

    Furthermore, to minimize the overhead of calculating the metrics in
    select_idle_cpu(), borrow the statistics from periodic load balance.
    As mentioned by Abel, on a platform with 112 CPUs per LLC, the
    sum_util calculated by periodic load balance after 112 ms would
    decay to about 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.7 = 8.75%, thus bringing a delay
    in reflecting the latest utilization. But it is a trade-off.
    Checking the util_avg in newidle load balance would be more frequent,
    but it brings overhead - multiple CPUs write/read the per-LLC shared
    variable and introduces cache contention. Tim also mentioned that,
    it is allowed to be non-optimal in terms of scheduling for the
    short-term variations, but if there is a long-term trend in the load
    behavior, the scheduler can adjust for that.

    When SIS_UTIL is enabled, the select_idle_cpu() uses the nr_scan
    calculated by SIS_UTIL instead of the one from SIS_PROP. As Peter and
    Mel suggested, SIS_UTIL should be enabled by default.

    This patch is based on the util_avg, which is very sensitive to the
    CPU frequency invariance. There is an issue that, when the max frequency
    has been clamp, the util_avg would decay insanely fast when
    the CPU is idle. Commit addca285120b ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Handle no_turbo
    in frequency invariance") could be used to mitigate this symptom, by adjusting
    the arch_max_freq_ratio when turbo is disabled. But this issue is still
    not thoroughly fixed, because the current code is unaware of the user-specified
    max CPU frequency.

    [Test result]

    netperf and tbench were launched with 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150%
    175% 200% of CPU number respectively. Hackbench and schbench were launched
    by 1, 2 ,4, 8 groups. Each test lasts for 100 seconds and repeats 3 times.

    The following is the benchmark result comparison between
    baseline:vanilla v5.19-rc1 and compare:patched kernel. Positive compare%
    indicates better performance.

    Take the 224 threads as an example, the SIS search metrics changes are
    illustrated below:

        vanilla                    patched

       5842896          +162.7%   15347978        sched_debug.cpu.sis_search.avg

    There is -87.9% less CPU scans after patched, which indicates lower overhead.
    Besides, with this patch applied, there is -13% less rq lock contention
    in perf-profile.calltrace.cycles-pp._raw_spin_lock.raw_spin_rq_lock_nested
    .try_to_wake_up.default_wake_function.woken_wake_function.
    This might help explain the performance improvement - Because this patch allows
    the waking task to remain on the previous CPU, rather than grabbing other CPUs'
    lock.

    *Consider the Standard Deviation, this -7.36% regression might not be valid.

    Also, a OLTP workload with a commercial RDBMS has been tested, and there
    is no significant change.

    There were concerns that unbalanced tasks among CPUs would cause problems.
    For example, suppose the LLC domain is composed of 8 CPUs, and 7 tasks are
    bound to CPU0~CPU6, while CPU7 is idle:

              CPU0    CPU1    CPU2    CPU3    CPU4    CPU5    CPU6    CPU7
    util_avg  1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    0

    Since the util_avg ratio is 87.5%( = 7/8 ), which is higher than 85%,
    select_idle_cpu() will not scan, thus CPU7 is undetected during scan.
    But according to Mel, it is unlikely the CPU7 will be idle all the time
    because CPU7 could pull some tasks via CPU_NEWLY_IDLE.

    lkp(kernel test robot) has reported a regression on stress-ng.sock on a
    very busy system. According to the sched_debug statistics, it might be caused
    by SIS_UTIL terminates the scan and chooses a previous CPU earlier, and this
    might introduce more context switch, especially involuntary preemption, which
    impacts a busy stress-ng. This regression has shown that, not all benchmarks
    in every scenario benefit from idle CPU scan limit, and it needs further
    investigation.

    Besides, there is slight regression in hackbench's 16 groups case when the
    LLC domain has 16 CPUs. Prateek mentioned that we should scan aggressively
    in an LLC domain with 16 CPUs. Because the cost to search for an idle one
    among 16 CPUs is negligible. The current patch aims to propose a generic
    solution and only considers the util_avg. Something like the below could
    be applied on top of the current patch to fulfill the requirement:

            if (llc_weight <= 16)
                    nr_scan = nr_scan * 32 / llc_weight;

    For LLC domain with 16 CPUs, the nr_scan will be expanded to 2 times large.
    The smaller the CPU number this LLC domain has, the larger nr_scan will be
    expanded. This needs further investigation.

    There is also ongoing work[2] from Abel to filter out the busy CPUs during
    wakeup, to further speed up the idle CPU scan. And it could be a following-up
    optimization on top of this change.

    arm64: errata: Remove AES hwcap for COMPAT tasks

    [ Upstream commit 44b3834b2eed595af07021b1c64e6f9bc396398b ]

    Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A72 have an erratum where an interrupt that
    occurs between a pair of AES instructions in aarch32 mode may corrupt
    the ELR. The task will subsequently produce the wrong AES result.

    The AES instructions are part of the cryptographic extensions, which are
    optional. User-space software will detect the support for these
    instructions from the hwcaps. If the platform doesn't support these
    instructions a software implementation should be used.

    Remove the hwcap bits on affected parts to indicate user-space should
    not use the AES instructions.

    arm64: kasan: Revert "arm64: mte: reset the page tag in page->flags"

    [ Upstream commit 20794545c14692094a882d2221c251c4573e6adf ]

    This reverts commit e5b8d9218951e59df986f627ec93569a0d22149b.

    Pages mapped in user-space with PROT_MTE have the allocation tags either
    zeroed or copied/restored to some user values. In order for the kernel
    to access such pages via page_address(), resetting the tag in
    page->flags was necessary. This tag resetting was deferred to
    set_pte_at() -> mte_sync_page_tags() but it can race with another CPU
    reading the flags (via page_to_virt()):

    P0 (mte_sync_page_tags):        P1 (memcpy from virt_to_page):
                                      Rflags!=0xff
      Wflags=0xff
      DMB (doesn't help)
      Wtags=0
                                      Rtags=0   // fault

    Since now the post_alloc_hook() function resets the page->flags tag when
    unpoisoning is skipped for user pages (including the __GFP_ZEROTAGS
    case), revert the arm64 commit calling page_kasan_tag_reset().

    arch: make TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT generic

    [ Upstream commit 4510bffb4d0246cdcc1f14c7367c026b807a862d ]

    On most architectures, IRQ flag tracing is disabled in NMI context, and
    architectures need to define and select TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT in
    order to enable this.

    Commit:

      859d069ee1ddd878 ("lockdep: Prepare for NMI IRQ state tracking")

    Permitted IRQ flag tracing in NMI context, allowing lockdep to work in
    NMI context where an architecture had suitable entry logic. At the time,
    most architectures did not have such suitable entry logic, and this broke
    lockdep on such architectures. Thus, this was partially disabled in
    commit:

      ed00495333ccc80f ("locking/lockdep: Fix TRACE_IRQFLAGS vs. NMIs")

    ... with architectures needing to select TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT to
    enable IRQ flag tracing in NMI context.

    Currently TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT is defined under
    arch/x86/Kconfig.debug. Move it to arch/Kconfig so architectures can
    select it without having to provide their own definition.

    Since the regular TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT is selected by
    arch/x86/Kconfig, the select of TRACE_IRQFLAGS_NMI_SUPPORT is moved
    there too.

    There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.

    x86: Handle idle=nomwait cmdline properly for x86_idle

    [ Upstream commit 8bcedb4ce04750e1ccc9a6b6433387f6a9166a56 ]

    When kernel is booted with idle=nomwait do not use MWAIT as the
    default idle state.

    If the user boots the kernel with idle=nomwait, it is a clear
    direction to not use mwait as the default idle state.
    However, the current code does not take this into consideration
    while selecting the default idle state on x86.

    Fix it by checking for the idle=nomwait boot option in
    prefer_mwait_c1_over_halt().

    Also update the documentation around idle=nomwait appropriately.

    epoll: autoremove wakers even more aggressively

    commit a16ceb13961068f7209e34d7984f8e42d2c06159 upstream.

    If a process is killed or otherwise exits while having active network
    connections and many threads waiting on epoll_wait, the threads will all
    be woken immediately, but not removed from ep->wq.  Then when network
    traffic scans ep->wq in wake_up, every wakeup attempt will fail, and will
    not remove the entries from the list.

    This means that the cost of the wakeup attempt is far higher than usual,
    does not decrease, and this also competes with the dying threads trying to
    actually make progress and remove themselves from the wq.

    Handle this by removing visited epoll wq entries unconditionally, rather
    than only when the wakeup succeeds - the structure of ep_poll means that
    the only potential loss is the timed_out->eavail heuristic, which now can
    race and result in a redundant ep_send_events attempt.  (But only when
    incoming data and a timeout actually race, not on every timeout)

    Shakeel added:

    : We are seeing this issue in production with real workloads and it has
    : caused hard lockups.  Particularly network heavy workloads with a lot
    : of threads in epoll_wait() can easily trigger this issue if they get
    : killed (oom-killed in our case).

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix null deref due to zeroed list head

    commit 580077855a40741cf511766129702d97ff02f4d9 upstream.

    In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error,
    nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object.

    nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never
    placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in
    a null dereference:

    BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in nft_trans_destroy+0x26/0x59
    Call Trace:
     nft_trans_destroy+0x26/0x59
     nf_tables_newtable+0x4bc/0x9bc
     [..]

    Its sane to assume that nft_trans_destroy() can be called
    on the transaction object returned by nft_trans_alloc(), so
    make sure the list head is initialised.

    When looking for rules by ID, use the chain that was used for the lookup by

    match that same chain. That way, struct nft_rule does not need to get

    currently prepared. This assumption is wrong. For trbs with a sg list,
    the length of the actual request has to be taken instead.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: refactor dwc3_repare_one_trb

    commit 23385cec5f354794dadced7f28c31da7ae3eb54c upstream.

    The function __dwc3_prepare_one_trb has many parameters. Since it is
    only used in dwc3_prepare_one_trb there is no point in keeping the
    function. We merge both functions and get rid of the big list of
    parameters.

    commit 6fd2c17fb6e02a8c0ab51df1cfec82ce96b8e83d upstream.

    This reverts commit 36a15e1cb134c0395261ba1940762703f778438c.

    The usage of FLAG_SEND_ZLP causes problems to other firmware/hardware
    versions that have no issues.

    The FLAG_SEND_ZLP is not safe to use in this context.
    See:
    https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/patch/1270599787.8900.8.camel@Linuxdev4-laptop/#118378
    The original problem needs another way to solve.

    USB: HCD: Fix URB giveback issue in tasklet function

    commit 26c6c2f8a907c9e3a2f24990552a4d77235791e6 upstream.

    Usb core introduce the mechanism of giveback of URB in tasklet context to
    reduce hardware interrupt handling time. On some test situation(such as
    FIO with 4KB block size), when tasklet callback function called to
    giveback URB, interrupt handler add URB node to the bh->head list also.
    If check bh->head list again after finish all URB giveback of local_list,
    then it may introduce a "dynamic balance" between giveback URB and add URB
    to bh->head list. This tasklet callback function may not exit for a long
    time, which will cause other tasklet function calls to be delayed. Some
    real-time applications(such as KB and Mouse) will see noticeable lag.

    In order to prevent the tasklet function from occupying the cpu for a long
    time at a time, new URBS will not be added to the local_list even though
    the bh->head list is not empty. But also need to ensure the left URB
    giveback to be processed in time, so add a member high_prio for structure
    giveback_urb_bh to prioritize tasklet and schelule this tasklet again if
    bh->head list is not empty.

    At the same time, we are able to prioritize tasklet through structure
    member high_prio. So, replace the local high_prio_bh variable with this
    structure member in usb_hcd_giveback_urb.

    According UCSI spec, PPM may clear the Error Status Data after the OPM

    coresight: Clear the connection field properly

    commit 2af89ebacf299b7fba5f3087d35e8a286ec33706 upstream.

    coresight devices track their connections (output connections) and
    hold a reference to the fwnode. When a device goes away, we walk through
    the devices on the coresight bus and make sure that the references
    are dropped. This happens both ways:
     a) For all output connections from the device, drop the reference to
        the target device via coresight_release_platform_data()

    b) Iterate over all the devices on the coresight bus and drop the
       reference to fwnode if *this* device is the target of the output
       connection, via coresight_remove_conns()->coresight_remove_match().

    However, the coresight_remove_match() doesn't clear the fwnode field,
    after dropping the reference, this causes use-after-free and
    additional refcount drops on the fwnode.

    e.g., if we have two devices, A and B, with a connection, A -> B.
    If we remove B first, B would clear the reference on B, from A
    via coresight_remove_match(). But when A is removed, it still has
    a connection with fwnode still pointing to B. Thus it tries to  drops
    the reference in coresight_release_platform_data(), raising the bells
    like :

    MIPS: cpuinfo: Fix a warning for CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK

    commit e1a534f5d074db45ae5cbac41d8912b98e96a006 upstream.

    When CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK and CONFIG_DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS is selected,
    cpu_max_bits_warn() generates a runtime warning similar as below while
    we show /proc/cpuinfo. Fix this by using nr_cpu_ids (the runtime limit)
    instead of NR_CPUS to iterate CPUs.

    powerpc/powernv: Avoid crashing if rng is NULL

    commit 90b5d4fe0b3ba7f589c6723c6bfb559d9e83956a upstream.

    On a bare-metal Power8 system that doesn't have an "ibm,power-rng", a
    malicious QEMU and guest that ignore the absence of the
    KVM_CAP_PPC_HWRNG flag, and calls H_RANDOM anyway, will dereference a
    NULL pointer.

    In practice all Power8 machines have an "ibm,power-rng", but let's not
    rely on that, add a NULL check and early return in
    powernv_get_random_real_mode().

    powerpc/ptdump: Fix display of RW pages on FSL_BOOK3E

    commit dd8de84b57b02ba9c1fe530a6d916c0853f136bd upstream.

    On FSL_BOOK3E, _PAGE_RW is defined with two bits, one for user and one
    for supervisor. As soon as one of the two bits is set, the page has
    to be display as RW. But the way it is implemented today requires both
    bits to be set in order to display it as RW.

    Instead of display RW when _PAGE_RW bits are set and R otherwise,
    reverse the logic and display R when _PAGE_RW bits are all 0 and
    RW otherwise.

    This change has no impact on other platforms as _PAGE_RW is a single
    bit on all of them.

    powerpc/fsl-pci: Fix Class Code of PCIe Root Port

    commit 0c551abfa004ce154d487d91777bf221c808a64f upstream.

    By default old pre-3.0 Freescale PCIe controllers reports invalid PCI Class
    Code 0x0b20 for PCIe Root Port. It can be seen by lspci -b output on P2020
    board which has this pre-3.0 controller:

      $ lspci -bvnn
      00:00.0 Power PC [0b20]: Freescale Semiconductor Inc P2020E [1957:0070] (rev 21)
              !!! Invalid class 0b20 for header type 01
              Capabilities: [4c] Express Root Port (Slot-), MSI 00

    Fix this issue by programming correct PCI Class Code 0x0604 for PCIe Root
    Port to the Freescale specific PCIe register 0x474.

    With this change lspci -b output is:

      $ lspci -bvnn
      00:00.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Freescale Semiconductor Inc P2020E [1957:0070] (rev 21) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
              Capabilities: [4c] Express Root Port (Slot-), MSI 00

    Without any "Invalid class" error. So class code was properly reflected
    into standard (read-only) PCI register 0x08.

    Same fix is already implemented in U-Boot pcie_fsl.c driver in commit:
    http://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/commit/d18d06ac35229345a0af80977a408cfbe1d1015b

    Fix activated by U-Boot stay active also after booting Linux kernel.
    But boards which use older U-Boot version without that fix are affected and
    still require this fix.

    So implement this class code fix also in kernel fsl_pci.c driver.

    powerpc/64e: Fix early TLB miss with KUAP

    commit 09317643117ade87c03158341e87466413fa8f1a upstream.

    With KUAP, the TLB miss handler bails out when an access to user
    memory is performed with a nul TID.

    But the normal TLB miss routine which is only used early during boot
    does the check regardless for all memory areas, not only user memory.

    By chance there is no early IO or vmalloc access, but when KASAN
    come we will start having early TLB misses.

    Fix it by creating a special branch for user accesses similar to the
    one in the 'bolted' TLB miss handlers. Unfortunately SPRN_MAS1 is
    now read too early and there are no registers available to preserve
    it so it will be read a second time.

    powerpc: Restore CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO in defconfigs

    Commit f9b3cd245784 ("Kconfig.debug: make DEBUG_INFO selectable from a
    choice") broke the selection of CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO by powerpc defconfigs.

    It is now necessary to select one of the three DEBUG_INFO_DWARF*
    options to get DEBUG_INFO enabled.

    Replace DEBUG_INFO=y by DEBUG_INFO_DWARF_TOOLCHAIN_DEFAULT=y in all
    defconfigs using the following command:

    sed -i s/DEBUG_INFO=y/DEBUG_INFO_DWARF_TOOLCHAIN_DEFAULT=y/g `git grep -l DEBUG_INFO arch/powerpc/configs/`

    ia64, processor: fix -Wincompatible-pointer-types in ia64_get_irr()

    commit e5a16a5c4602c119262f350274021f90465f479d upstream.

    test_bit(), as any other bitmap op, takes `unsigned long *` as a
    second argument (pointer to the actual bitmap), as any bitmap
    itself is an array of unsigned longs. However, the ia64_get_irr()
    code passes a ref to `u64` as a second argument.
    This works with the ia64 bitops implementation due to that they
    have `void *` as the second argument and then cast it later on.
    This works with the bitmap API itself due to that `unsigned long`
    has the same size on ia64 as `u64` (`unsigned long long`), but
    from the compiler PoV those two are different.
    Define @irr as `unsigned long` to fix that. That implies no
    functional changes. Has been hidden for 16 years!

    media: [PATCH] pci: atomisp_cmd: fix three missing checks on list iterator

    commit 09b204eb9de9fdf07d028c41c4331b5cfeb70dd7 upstream.

    The three bugs are here:
            __func__, s3a_buf->s3a_data->exp_id);
            __func__, md_buf->metadata->exp_id);
            __func__, dis_buf->dis_data->exp_id);

    The list iterator 's3a_buf/md_buf/dis_buf' will point to a bogus
    position containing HEAD if the list is empty or no element is found.
    This case must be checked before any use of the iterator, otherwise
    it will lead to a invalid memory access.

    To fix this bug, add an check. Use a new variable '*_iter' as the
    list iterator, while use the old variable '*_buf' as a dedicated
    pointer to point to the found element.

    md-raid: destroy the bitmap after destroying the thread

    commit e151db8ecfb019b7da31d076130a794574c89f6f upstream.

    When we ran the lvm test "shell/integrity-blocksize-3.sh" on a kernel with
    kasan, we got failure in write_page.

    The reason for the failure is that md_bitmap_destroy is called before
    destroying the thread and the thread may be waiting in the function
    write_page for the bio to complete. When the thread finishes waiting, it
    executes "if (test_bit(BITMAP_WRITE_ERROR, &bitmap->flags))", which
    triggers the kasan warning.

    Note that the commit 48df498daf62 that caused this bug claims that it is
    neede for md-cluster, you should check md-cluster and possibly find
    another bugfix for it.

    fuse: fix deadlock between atomic O_TRUNC and page invalidation

    commit 2fdbb8dd01556e1501132b5ad3826e8f71e24a8b upstream.

    fuse_finish_open() will be called with FUSE_NOWRITE set in case of atomic
    O_TRUNC open(), so commit 76224355db75 ("fuse: truncate pagecache on
    atomic_o_trunc") replaced invalidate_inode_pages2() by truncate_pagecache()
    in such a case to avoid the A-A deadlock. However, we found another A-B-B-A
    deadlock related to the case above, which will cause the xfstests
    generic/464 testcase hung in our virtio-fs test environment.

    For example, consider two processes concurrently open one same file, one
    with O_TRUNC and another without O_TRUNC. The deadlock case is described
    below, if open(O_TRUNC) is already set_nowrite(acquired A), and is trying
    to lock a page (acquiring B), open() could have held the page lock
    (acquired B), and waiting on the page writeback (acquiring A). This would
    lead to deadlocks.

    open(O_TRUNC)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    fuse_open_common
      inode_lock            [C acquire]
      fuse_set_nowrite      [A acquire]

      fuse_finish_open
        truncate_pagecache
          lock_page         [B acquire]
          truncate_inode_page
          unlock_page       [B release]

      fuse_release_nowrite  [A release]
      inode_unlock          [C release]
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    open()
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    fuse_open_common
      fuse_finish_open
        invalidate_inode_pages2
          lock_page         [B acquire]
            fuse_launder_page
              fuse_wait_on_page_writeback [A acquire & release]
          unlock_page       [B release]
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Besides this case, all calls of invalidate_inode_pages2() and
    invalidate_inode_pages2_range() in fuse code also can deadlock with
    open(O_TRUNC).

    Fix by moving the truncate_pagecache() call outside the nowrite protected
    region.  The nowrite protection is only for delayed writeback
    (writeback_cache) case, where inode lock does not protect against
    truncation racing with writes on the server.  Write syscalls racing with
    page cache truncation still get the inode lock protection.

    This patch also changes the order of filemap_invalidate_lock()
    vs. fuse_set_nowrite() in fuse_open_common().  This new order matches the
    order found in fuse_file_fallocate() and fuse_do_setattr().

    fuse: write inode in fuse_release()

    commit 035ff33cf4db101250fb980a3941bf078f37a544 upstream.

    A race between write(2) and close(2) allows pages to be dirtied after
    fuse_flush -> write_inode_now().  If these pages are not flushed from
    fuse_release(), then there might not be a writable open file later.  So any
    remaining dirty pages must be written back before the file is released.

    This is a partial revert of the blamed commit.

    fuse: ioctl: translate ENOSYS

    commit 02c0cab8e7345b06f1c0838df444e2902e4138d3 upstream.

    Overlayfs may fail to complete updates when a filesystem lacks
    fileattr/xattr syscall support and responds with an ENOSYS error code,
    resulting in an unexpected "Function not implemented" error.

    This bug may occur with FUSE filesystems, such as davfs2.

    Steps to reproduce:

      # install davfs2, e.g., apk add davfs2
      mkdir /test mkdir /test/lower /test/upper /test/work /test/mnt
      yes '' | mount -t davfs -o ro http://some-web-dav-server/path \
        /test/lower
      mount -t overlay -o upperdir=/test/upper,lowerdir=/test/lower \
        -o workdir=/test/work overlay /test/mnt

      # when "some-file" exists in the lowerdir, this fails with "Function
      # not implemented", with dmesg showing "overlayfs: failed to retrieve
      # lower fileattr (/some-file, err=-38)"
      touch /test/mnt/some-file

    The underlying cause of this regresion is actually in FUSE, which fails to
    translate the ENOSYS error code returned by userspace filesystem (which
    means that the ioctl operation is not supported) to ENOTTY.

    scsi: sg: Allow waiting for commands to complete on removed device

    commit 3455607fd7be10b449f5135c00dc306b85dc0d21 upstream.

    When a SCSI device is removed while in active use, currently sg will
    immediately return -ENODEV on any attempt to wait for active commands that
    were sent before the removal.  This is problematic for commands that use
    SG_FLAG_DIRECT_IO since the data buffer may still be in use by the kernel
    when userspace frees or reuses it after getting ENODEV, leading to
    corrupted userspace memory (in the case of READ-type commands) or corrupted
    data being sent to the device (in the case of WRITE-type commands).  This
    has been seen in practice when logging out of a iscsi_tcp session, where
    the iSCSI driver may still be processing commands after the device has been
    marked for removal.

    Change the policy to allow userspace to wait for active sg commands even
    when the device is being removed.  Return -ENODEV only when there are no
    more responses to read.

    commit 5e1f91850365de55ca74945866c002fda8f00331 upstream.

    iio_format_avail_range() should print range as follow [min, step, max], so
    the function was previously calling iio_format_list() with length = 3,
    length variable refers to the array size of values not the number of
    elements. In case of non IIO_VAL_INT values each element has integer part
    and decimal part. With length = 3 this would cause premature end of loop
    and result in printing only one element.

    um: seed rng using host OS rng

    commit 0b9ba6135d7f18b82f3d8bebb55ded725ba88e0e upstream.

    UML generally does not provide access to special CPU instructions like
    RDRAND, and execution tends to be rather deterministic, with no real
    hardware interrupts, making good randomness really very hard, if not
    all together impossible. Not only is this a security eyebrow raiser, but
    it's also quite annoying when trying to do various pieces of UML-based
    automation that takes a long time to boot, if ever.

    Fix this by trivially calling getrandom() in the host and using that
    seed as "bootloader randomness", which initializes the rng immediately
    at UML boot.

    The old behavior can be restored the same way as on any other arch, by
    way of CONFIG_TRUST_BOOTLOADER_RANDOMNESS=n or
    random.trust_bootloader=0. So seen from that perspective, this just
    makes UML act like other archs, which is positive in its own right.

    Additionally, wire up arch_get_random_{int,long}() in the same way, so
    that reseeds can also make use of the host RNG, controllable by
    CONFIG_TRUST_CPU_RANDOMNESS and random.trust_cpu, per usual.

    mtd: rawnand: arasan: Update NAND bus clock instead of system clock

    commit 7499bfeedb47efc1ee4dc793b92c610d46e6d6a6 upstream.

    In current implementation the Arasan NAND driver is updating the
    system clock(i.e., anand->clk) in accordance to the timing modes
    (i.e., SDR or NVDDR). But as per the Arasan NAND controller spec the
    flash clock or the NAND bus clock(i.e., nfc->bus_clk), need to be
    updated instead. This patch keeps the system clock unchanged and updates
    the NAND bus clock as per the timing modes.

    mtd: rawnand: arasan: Fix clock rate in NV-DDR

    commit e16eceea863b417fd328588b1be1a79de0bc937f upstream.

    According to the Arasan NAND controller spec, the flash clock rate for SDR
    must be <= 100 MHz, while for NV-DDR it must be the same as the rate of the
    CLK line for the mode. The driver previously always set 100 MHz for NV-DDR,
    which would result in incorrect behavior for NV-DDR modes 0-4.

    The appropriate clock rate can be calculated from the NV-DDR timing
    parameters as 1/tCK, or for rates measured in picoseconds,
    10^12 / nand_nvddr_timings->tCK_min.

    compat_ro_flags         0x40000003
                            ( FREE_SPACE_TREE |

                              unknown flag: 0x40000000 )

    Then even if we can only mount it RO, we will still cause metadata
    update for log replay:

      BTRFS info (device dm-1): flagging fs with big metadata feature
      BTRFS info (device dm-1): using free space tree
      BTRFS info (device dm-1): has skinny extents
      BTRFS info (device dm-1): start tree-log replay

    This is definitely against RO compact flag requirement.

    [CAUSE]
    RO compact flag only forces us to do RO mount, but we will still do log
    replay for plain RO mount.

    Thus this will result us to do log replay and update metadata.

    This can be very problematic for new RO compat flag, for example older
    kernel can not understand v2 cache, and if we allow metadata update on
    RO mount and invalidate/corrupt v2 cache.

    [FIX]
    Just reject the mount unless rescue=nologreplay is provided:

      BTRFS error (device dm-1): cannot replay dirty log with unsupport optional features (0x40000000), try rescue=nologreplay instead

    We don't want to set rescue=nologreply directly, as this would make the
    end user to read the old data, and cause confusion.

    Since the such case is really rare, we're mostly fine to just reject the
    mount with an error message, which also includes the proper workaround.

    bpf: Fix KASAN use-after-free Read in compute_effective_progs

    commit 4c46091ee985ae84c60c5e95055d779fcd291d87 upstream.

    Syzbot found a Use After Free bug in compute_effective_progs().
    The reproducer creates a number of BPF links, and causes a fault
    injected alloc to fail, while calling bpf_link_detach on them.
    Link detach triggers the link to be freed by bpf_link_free(),
    which calls __cgroup_bpf_detach() and update_effective_progs().
    If the memory allocation in this function fails, the function restores
    the pointer to the bpf_cgroup_link on the cgroup list, but the memory
    gets freed just after it returns. After this, every subsequent call to
    update_effective_progs() causes this already deallocated pointer to be
    dereferenced in prog_list_length(), and triggers KASAN UAF error.

    To fix this issue don't preserve the pointer to the prog or link in the
    list, but remove it and replace it with a dummy prog without shrinking
    the table. The subsequent call to __cgroup_bpf_detach() or
    __cgroup_bpf_detach() will correct it.

    drm/amdgpu: Check BO's requested pinning domains against its preferred_domains

    commit f5ba14043621f4afdf3ad5f92ee2d8dbebbe4340 upstream.

    When pinning a buffer, we should check to see if there are any
    additional restrictions imposed by bo->preferred_domains. This will
    prevent the BO from being moved to an invalid domain when pinning.

    For example, this can happen if the user requests to create a BO in GTT
    domain for display scanout. amdgpu_dm will allow pinning to either VRAM
    or GTT domains, since DCN can scanout from either or. However, in
    amdgpu_bo_pin_restricted(), pinning to VRAM is preferred if there is
    adequate carveout. This can lead to pinning to VRAM despite the user
    requesting GTT placement for the BO.

    v2: Allow the kernel to override the domain, which can happen when
        exporting a BO to a V4L camera (for example).

    drm/tegra: Fix vmapping of prime buffers

    commit c7860cbee9989882d2908682526a5ef617523cfe upstream.

    The code assumes that Tegra GEM is permanently vmapped, which is not
    true for the scattered buffers. After converting Tegra video decoder
    driver to V4L API, we're now getting a BUG_ON from dma-buf core on playing
    video using libvdpau-tegra on T30+ because tegra_gem_prime_vmap() sets
    vaddr to NULL. Older pre-V4L video decoder driver wasn't vmapping dma-bufs.
    Fix it by actually vmapping the exported GEMs.

    drm/nouveau/kms: Fix failure path for creating DP connectors

    commit ca0367ca5d9216644b41f86348d6661f8d9e32d8 upstream.

    It looks like that when we moved nouveau over to using drm_dp_aux_init()
    and registering it's aux bus during late connector registration, we totally
    forgot to fix the failure codepath in nouveau_connector_create() - as it
    still seems to assume that drm_dp_aux_init() can fail (it can't).

    So, let's fix that and also add a missing check to ensure that we've
    properly allocated nv_connector->aux.name while we're at it.

    drm/ingenic: Use the highest possible DMA burst size

    commit f0dce5c4fdaf9e98dd2755ffb1363822854b6287 upstream.

    Until now, when running at the maximum resolution of 1280x720 at 32bpp
    on the JZ4770 SoC the output was garbled, the X/Y position of the
    top-left corner of the framebuffer warping to a random position with
    the whole image being offset accordingly, every time a new frame was
    being submitted.

    This problem can be eliminated by using a bigger burst size for the DMA.

    Set in each soc_info structure the maximum burst size supported by the
    corresponding SoC, and use it in the driver.

    Set the new value using regmap_update_bits() instead of
    regmap_set_bits(), since we do want to override the old value of the
    burst size. (Note that regmap_set_bits() wasn't really valid before for
    the same reason, but it never seemed to be a problem).

    drm/vc4: hdmi: Disable audio if dmas property is present but empty

    commit db2b927f8668adf3ac765e0921cd2720f5c04172 upstream.

    The dmas property is used to hold the dmaengine channel used for audio
    output.

    Older device trees were missing that property, so if it's not there we
    disable the audio output entirely.

    However, some overlays have set an empty value to that property, mostly
    to workaround the fact that overlays cannot remove a property. Let's add
    a test for that case and if it's empty, let's disable it as well.

    support for the RX-8035 was added, and was causing read errors when
    the hour register 'overflowed'.

    To deal with the relevant register not always being visible in

    store it in the driver state.

    RISC-V: Update user page mapping only once during start

    commit 133a6d1fe7d7ad8393af025c4dde379c0616661f upstream.

    Currently, riscv_pmu_event_set_period updates the userpage mapping.
    However, the caller of riscv_pmu_event_set_period should update
    the userpage mapping because the counter can not be updated/started
    from set_period function in counter overflow path.

    Invoke the perf_event_update_userpage at the caller so that it
    doesn't get invoked twice during counter start path.

    RISC-V: Fix SBI PMU calls for RV32

    commit 0209b5830bea42dd3ce33ab0397231e67ec3b751 upstream.

    Some of the SBI PMU calls does not pass 64bit arguments
    correctly and not under RV32 compile time flags. Currently,
    this doesn't create any incorrect results as RV64 ignores
    any value in the additional register and qemu doesn't support
    raw events.

    Fix those SBI calls in order to set correct values for RV32.

    RISC-V: Fixup schedule out issue in machine_crash_shutdown()

    commit ad943893d5f1d0aeea892bf7b781cf8062b36d58 upstream.

    Current task of executing crash kexec will be schedule out when panic is
    triggered by RCU Stall, as it needs to wait rcu completion. It lead to
    inability to enter the crash system.

    The implementation of machine_crash_shutdown() is non-standard for RISC-V
    according to other Arch's implementation(eg, x86, arm64), we need to send
    IPI to stop secondary harts.

    RISC-V: Fixup get incorrect user mode PC for kernel mode regs

    commit 59c026c359c30f116fef6ee958e24d04983efbb0 upstream.

    When use 'echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger' to trigger kdump, riscv_crash_save_regs()
    will be called to save regs for vmcore, we found "epc" value 00ffffffa5537400
    is not a valid kernel virtual address, but is a user virtual address. Other
    regs(eg, ra, sp, gp...) are correct kernel virtual address.
    Actually 0x00ffffffb0dd9400 is the user mode PC of 'PID: 113 Comm: sh', which
    is saved in the task's stack.

    riscv: dts: starfive: correct number of external interrupts

    commit a208acf0eac857dc8cdaddd63a4e18ed03f91786 upstream.

    The PLIC integrated on the Vic_U7_Core integrated on the StarFive
    JH7100 SoC actually supports 133 external interrupts.  127 of these
    are exposed to the outside world; the remainder are used by other
    devices that are part of the core-complex such as the L2 cache
    controller.  But all 133 interrupts are external interrupts as far
    as the PLIC is concerned.  Fix the property so that the driver can
    manage these additional interrupts, which is important since the
    interrupts for the L2 cache controller are enabled by default.

    dt-bindings: riscv: fix SiFive l2-cache's cache-sets

    commit b60cf8e59e61133b6c9514ff8d8c8d7049d040ef upstream.

    Fix device tree schema validation error messages for the SiFive
    Unmatched: ' cache-sets:0:0: 1024 was expected'.

    The existing bindings allow for just 1024 cache-sets but the fu740 on
    Unmatched the has 2048 cache-sets. The ISA itself permits any arbitrary
    power of two, however this is not supported by dt-schema. The RTL for
    the IP, to which the number of cache-sets is a tunable parameter, has
    been released publicly so speculatively adding a small number of
    "reasonable" values seems unwise also.

    Instead, as the binding only supports two distinct controllers: add 2048
    and explicitly lock it to the fu740's l2 cache while limiting 1024 to
    the l2 cache on the fu540.

    parisc: io_pgetevents_time64() needs compat syscall in 32-bit compat mode

    commit 6431e92fc827bdd2d28f79150d90415ba9ce0d21 upstream.

    For all syscalls in 32-bit compat mode on 64-bit kernels the upper
    32-bits of the 64-bit registers are zeroed out, so a negative 32-bit
    signed value will show up as positive 64-bit signed value.

    This behaviour breaks the io_pgetevents_time64() syscall which expects
    signed 64-bit values for the "min_nr" and "nr" parameters.
    Fix this by switching to the compat_sys_io_pgetevents_time64() syscall,
    which uses "compat_long_t" types for those parameters.

    ovl: drop WARN_ON() dentry is NULL in ovl_encode_fh()

    commit dd524b7f317de8d31d638cbfdc7be4cf9b770e42 upstream.

    Some code paths cannot guarantee the inode have any dentry alias. So
    WARN_ON() all !dentry may flood the kernel logs.

    For example, when an overlayfs inode is watched by inotifywait (1), and
    someone is trying to read the /proc/$(pidof inotifywait)/fdinfo/INOTIFY_FD,
    at that time if the dentry has been reclaimed by kernel (such as
    echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches), there will be a WARN_ON(). The
    printed call stack would be like:

        ? show_mark_fhandle+0xf0/0xf0
        show_mark_fhandle+0x4a/0xf0
        ? show_mark_fhandle+0xf0/0xf0
        ? seq_vprintf+0x30/0x50
        ? seq_printf+0x53/0x70
        ? show_mark_fhandle+0xf0/0xf0
        inotify_fdinfo+0x70/0x90
        show_fdinfo.isra.4+0x53/0x70
        seq_show+0x130/0x170
        seq_read+0x153/0x440
        vfs_read+0x94/0x150

        do_syscall_64+0x59/0x1e0

    So let's drop WARN_ON() to avoid kernel log flooding.

    crypto: ccp - Use kzalloc for sev ioctl interfaces to prevent kernel memory leak

    commit 13dc15a3f5fd7f884e4bfa8c011a0ae868df12ae upstream.

    For some sev ioctl interfaces, input may be passed that is less than or
    equal to SEV_FW_BLOB_MAX_SIZE, but larger than the data that PSP
    firmware returns. In this case, kmalloc will allocate memory that is the
    size of the input rather than the size of the data. Since PSP firmware
    doesn't fully overwrite the buffer, the sev ioctl interfaces with the
    issue may return uninitialized slab memory.

    Currently, all of the ioctl interfaces in the ccp driver are safe, but
    to prevent future problems, change all ioctl interfaces that allocate
    memory with kmalloc to use kzalloc and memset the data buffer to zero
    in sev_ioctl_do_platform_status.

    fix short copy handling in copy_mc_pipe_to_iter()

    commit c3497fd009ef2c59eea60d21c3ac22de3585ed7d upstream.

    Unlike other copying operations on ITER_PIPE, copy_mc_to_iter() can
    result in a short copy.  In that case we need to trim the unused
    buffers, as well as the length of partially filled one - it's not
    enough to set ->head, ->iov_offset and ->count to reflect how
    much had we copied.  Not hard to fix, fortunately...

    I'd put a helper (pipe_discard_from(pipe, head)) into pipe_fs_i.h,
    rather than iov_iter.c - it has nothing to do with iov_iter and
    having it will allow us to avoid an ugly kludge in fs/splice.c.
    We could put it into lib/iov_iter.c for now and move it later,
    but I don't see the point going that way...

    sleep.  On disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in
    ->ndo_stop().  But in 2003, that was moved to ->disconnect() by historic
    commit "[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock":

      https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c

    The change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue
    implementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait
    for completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that
    could deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex
    held in ->ndo_stop().

    The commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a
    use-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,
    ax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:

    * If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before
      disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)
      ->status() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().
    * usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's ->link_reset() callback,
      which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().
    * That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().

    Because usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),
    netif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and
    linkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.

    In 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of
    usbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf
    ("drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()").

    Unfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to
    ->ndo_stop().  Rectify that omission at long last.

    fbcon: Fix accelerated fbdev scrolling while logo is still shown

    commit 3866cba87dcd0162fb41e9b3b653d0af68fad5ec upstream.

    There is no need to directly skip over to the SCROLL_REDRAW case while
    the logo is still shown.

    When using DRM, this change has no effect because the code will reach
    the SCROLL_REDRAW case immediately anyway.

    But if you run an accelerated fbdev driver and have
    FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_LEGACY_ACCELERATION enabled, console scrolling is
    slowed down by factors so that it feels as if you use a 9600 baud
    terminal.

    So, drop those unnecessary checks and speed up fbdev console
    acceleration during bootup.

    fbcon: Fix boundary checks for fbcon=vc:n1-n2 parameters

    commit cad564ca557f8d3bb3b1fa965d9a2b3f6490ec69 upstream.

    The user may use the fbcon=vc:<n1>-<n2> option to tell fbcon to take
    over the given range (n1...n2) of consoles. The value for n1 and n2
    needs to be a positive number and up to (MAX_NR_CONSOLES - 1).
    The given values were not fully checked against those boundaries yet.

    To fix the issue, convert first_fb_vc and last_fb_vc to unsigned
    integers and check them against the upper boundary, and make sure that
    first_fb_vc is smaller than last_fb_vc.

    thermal: sysfs: Fix cooling_device_stats_setup() error code path

    commit d5a8aa5d7d80d21ab6b266f1bed4194b61746199 upstream.

    If cooling_device_stats_setup() fails to create the stats object, it
    must clear the last slot in cooling_device_attr_groups that was
    initially empty (so as to make it possible to add stats attributes to
    the cooling device attribute groups).

    Failing to do so may cause the stats attributes to be created by
    mistake for a device that doesn't have a stats object, because the
    slot in question might be populated previously during the registration
    of another cooling device.

    All creation paths except for O_TMPFILE handle umask in the vfs directly
    if the filesystem doesn't support or enable POSIX ACLs. If the filesystem
    does then umask handling is deferred until posix_acl_create().

    vfs: Check the truncate maximum size in inode_newsize_ok()

    commit e2ebff9c57fe4eb104ce4768f6ebcccf76bef849 upstream.

    If something manages to set the maximum file size to MAX_OFFSET+1, this
    can cause the xfs and ext4 filesystems at least to become corrupt.

    Ordinarily, the kernel protects against userspace trying this by
    checking the value early in the truncate() and ftruncate() system calls
    calls - but there are at least two places that this check is bypassed:

     (1) Cachefiles will round up the EOF of the backing file to DIO block
         size so as to allow DIO on the final block - but this might push
         the offset negative. It then calls notify_change(), but this
         inadvertently bypasses the checking. This can be triggered if
         someone puts an 8EiB-1 file on a server for someone else to try and
         access by, say, nfs.

     (2) ksmbd doesn't check the value it is given in set_end_of_file_info()
         and then calls vfs_truncate() directly - which also bypasses the
         check.

    In both cases, it is potentially possible for a network filesystem to
    cause a disk filesystem to be corrupted: cachefiles in the client's
    cache filesystem; ksmbd in the server's filesystem.

    nfsd is okay as it checks the value, but we can then remove this check
    too.

    Fix this by adding a check to inode_newsize_ok(), as called from
    setattr_prepare(), thereby catching the issue as filesystems set up to
    perform the truncate with minimal opportunity for bypassing the new
    check.

    KVM: nVMX: Always enable TSC scaling for L2 when it was enabled for L1

    commit 156b9d76e8822f2956c15029acf2d4b171502f3a upstream.

    Windows 10/11 guests with Hyper-V role (WSL2) enabled are observed to
    hang upon boot or shortly after when a non-default TSC frequency was
    set for L1. The issue is observed on a host where TSC scaling is
    supported. The problem appears to be that Windows doesn't use TSC
    scaling for its guests, even when the feature is advertised, and KVM
    filters SECONDARY_EXEC_TSC_SCALING out when creating L2 controls from
    L1's VMCS. This leads to L2 running with the default frequency (matching
    host's) while L1 is running with an altered one.

    Keep SECONDARY_EXEC_TSC_SCALING in secondary exec controls for L2 when
    it was set for L1. TSC_MULTIPLIER is already correctly computed and
    written by prepare_vmcs02().

    to the selector, not zero.

    Note, a non-canonical memory operand on LLDT/LTR does generate a #GP(0),
    but the KVM code in question is specific to the base from the descriptor.

    KVM: x86: Mark TSS busy during LTR emulation _after_ all fault checks

    commit ec6e4d863258d4bfb36d48d5e3ef68140234d688 upstream.

    Wait to mark the TSS as busy during LTR emulation until after all fault
    checks for the LTR have passed.  Specifically, don't mark the TSS busy if
    the new TSS base is non-canonical.

    Opportunistically drop the one-off !seg_desc.PRESENT check for TR as the
    only reason for the early check was to avoid marking a !PRESENT TSS as
    busy, i.e. the common !PRESENT is now done before setting the busy bit.

    KVM: nVMX: Inject #UD if VMXON is attempted with incompatible CR0/CR4

    commit c7d855c2aff2d511fd60ee2e356134c4fb394799 upstream.

    Inject a #UD if L1 attempts VMXON with a CR0 or CR4 that is disallowed
    per the associated nested VMX MSRs' fixed0/1 settings.  KVM cannot rely
    on hardware to perform the checks, even for the few checks that have
    higher priority than VM-Exit, as (a) KVM may have forced CR0/CR4 bits in
    hardware while running the guest, (b) there may incompatible CR0/CR4 bits
    that have lower priority than VM-Exit, e.g. CR0.NE, and (c) userspace may
    have further restricted the allowed CR0/CR4 values by manipulating the
    guest's nested VMX MSRs.

    Note, despite a very strong desire to throw shade at Jim, commit
    70f3aac964ae ("kvm: nVMX: Remove superfluous VMX instruction fault checks")
    is not to blame for the buggy behavior (though the comment...).  That
    commit only removed the CR0.PE, EFLAGS.VM, and COMPATIBILITY mode checks
    (though it did erroneously drop the CPL check, but that has already been
    remedied).  KVM may force CR0.PE=1, but will do so only when also
    forcing EFLAGS.VM=1 to emulate Real Mode, i.e. hardware will still #UD.

    KVM: nVMX: Account for KVM reserved CR4 bits in consistency checks

    commit ca58f3aa53d165afe4ab74c755bc2f6d168617ac upstream.

    Check that the guest (L2) and host (L1) CR4 values that would be loaded
    by nested VM-Enter and VM-Exit respectively are valid with respect to
    KVM's (L0 host) allowed CR4 bits.  Failure to check KVM reserved bits
    would allow L1 to load an illegal CR4 (or trigger hardware VM-Fail or
    failed VM-Entry) by massaging guest CPUID to allow features that are not
    supported by KVM.  Amusingly, KVM itself is an accomplice in its doom, as
    KVM adjusts L1's MSR_IA32_VMX_CR4_FIXED1 to allow L1 to enable bits for
    L2 based on L1's CPUID model.

    Note, although nested_{guest,host}_cr4_valid() are _currently_ used if
    and only if the vCPU is post-VMXON (nested.vmxon == true), that may not
    be true in the future, e.g. emulating VMXON has a bug where it doesn't
    check the allowed/required CR0/CR4 bits.

    current config.  Using the guest's config to audit the new config
    prevents userspace from restoring the original config (KVM's config) if

    KVM: x86: Split kvm_is_valid_cr4() and export only the non-vendor bits

    commit c33f6f2228fe8517e38941a508e9f905f99ecba9 upstream.

    Split the common x86 parts of kvm_is_valid_cr4(), i.e. the reserved bits
    checks, into a separate helper, __kvm_is_valid_cr4(), and export only the
    inner helper to vendor code in order to prevent nested VMX from calling
    back into vmx_is_valid_cr4() via kvm_is_valid_cr4().

    On SVM, this is a nop as SVM doesn't place any additional restrictions on
    CR4.

    On VMX, this is also currently a nop, but only because nested VMX is
    missing checks on reserved CR4 bits for nested VM-Enter.  That bug will
    be fixed in a future patch, and could simply use kvm_is_valid_cr4() as-is,
    but nVMX has _another_ bug where VMXON emulation doesn't enforce VMX's
    restrictions on CR0/CR4.  The cleanest and most intuitive way to fix the
    VMXON bug is to use nested_host_cr{0,4}_valid().  If the CR4 variant
    routes through kvm_is_valid_cr4(), using nested_host_cr4_valid() won't do
    the right thing for the VMXON case as vmx_is_valid_cr4() enforces VMX's
    restrictions if and only if the vCPU is post-VMXON.

    KVM: Do not incorporate page offset into gfn=>pfn cache user address

    commit 3ba2c95ea180740b16281fa43a3ee5f47279c0ed upstream.

    Don't adjust the userspace address in the gfn=>pfn cache by the page
    offset from the gpa.  KVM should never use the user address directly, and
    all KVM operations that translate a user address to something else
    require the user address to be page aligned.  Ignoring the offset will
    allow the cache to reuse a gfn=>hva translation in the unlikely event
    that the page offset of the gpa changes, but the gfn does not.  And more
    importantly, not having to (un)adjust the user address will simplify a
    future bug fix.

    KVM: Fix multiple races in gfn=>pfn cache refresh

    commit 58cd407ca4c6278cf9f9d09a2e663bf645b0c982 upstream.

    Rework the gfn=>pfn cache (gpc) refresh logic to address multiple races
    between the cache itself, and between the cache and mmu_notifier events.

    The existing refresh code attempts to guard against races with the
    mmu_notifier by speculatively marking the cache valid, and then marking
    it invalid if a mmu_notifier invalidation occurs.  That handles the case
    where an invalidation occurs between dropping and re-acquiring gpc->lock,
    but it doesn't handle the scenario where the cache is refreshed after the
    cache was invalidated by the notifier, but before the notifier elevates
    mmu_notifier_count.  The gpc refresh can't use the "retry" helper as its
    invalidation occurs _before_ mmu_notifier_count is elevated and before
    mmu_notifier_range_start is set/updated.

                                              caller accesses freed pfn 'X'

    Key off of mn_active_invalidate_count to detect that a pfncache refresh
    needs to wait for an in-progress mmu_notifier invalidation.  While
    mn_active_invalidate_count is not guaranteed to be stable, it is
    guaranteed to be elevated prior to an invalidation acquiring gpc->lock,
    so either the refresh will see an active invalidation and wait, or the
    invalidation will run after the refresh completes.

    Speculatively marking the cache valid is itself flawed, as a concurrent
    kvm_gfn_to_pfn_cache_check() would see a valid cache with stale pfn/khva
    values.  The KVM Xen use case explicitly allows/wants multiple users;
    even though the caches are allocated per vCPU, __kvm_xen_has_interrupt()
    can read a different vCPU (or vCPUs).  Address this race by invalidating
    the cache prior to dropping gpc->lock (this is made possible by fixing
    the above mmu_notifier race).

    Complicating all of this is the fact that both the hva=>pfn resolution
    and mapping of the kernel address can sleep, i.e. must be done outside
    of gpc->lock.

    Fix the above races in one fell swoop, trying to fix each individual race
    is largely pointless and essentially impossible to test, e.g. closing one
    hole just shifts the focus to the other hole.

    KVM: Fully serialize gfn=>pfn cache refresh via mutex

    commit 93984f19e7bce4c18084a6ef3dacafb155b806ed upstream.

    Protect gfn=>pfn cache refresh with a mutex to fully serialize refreshes.
    The refresh logic doesn't protect against

    - concurrent unmaps, or refreshes with different GPAs (which may or may not
      happen in practice, for example if a cache is only used under vcpu->mutex;
      but it's allowed in the code)

    - a false negative on the memslot generation.  If the first refresh sees
      a stale memslot generation, it will refresh the hva and generation before
      moving on to the hva=>pfn translation.  If it then drops gpc->lock, a
      different user of the cache can come along, acquire gpc->lock, see that
      the memslot generation is fresh, and skip the hva=>pfn update due to the
      userspace address also matching (because it too was updated).

    The refresh path can already sleep during hva=>pfn resolution, so wrap
    the refresh with a mutex to ensure that any given refresh runs to
    completion before other callers can start their refresh.

    KVM: s390: pv: don't present the ecall interrupt twice

    commit c3f0e5fd2d33d80c5a5a8b5e5d2bab2841709cc8 upstream.

    When the SIGP interpretation facility is present and a VCPU sends an
    ecall to another VCPU in enabled wait, the sending VCPU receives a 56
    intercept (partial execution), so KVM can wake up the receiving CPU.
    Note that the SIGP interpretation facility will take care of the
    interrupt delivery and KVM's only job is to wake the receiving VCPU.

    For PV, the sending VCPU will receive a 108 intercept (pv notify) and
    should continue like in the non-PV case, i.e. wake the receiving VCPU.

    For PV and non-PV guests the interrupt delivery will occur through the
    SIGP interpretation facility on SIE entry when SIE finds the X bit in
    the status field set.

    However, in handle_pv_notification(), there was no special handling for
    SIGP, which leads to interrupt injection being requested by KVM for the
    next SIE entry. This results in the interrupt being delivered twice:
    once by the SIGP interpretation facility and once by KVM through the
    IICTL.

    Add the necessary special handling in handle_pv_notification(), similar
    to handle_partial_execution(), which simply wakes the receiving VCPU and
    leave interrupt delivery to the SIGP interpretation facility.

    In contrast to external calls, emergency calls are not interpreted but
    also cause a 108 intercept, which is why we still need to call
    handle_instruction() for SIGP orders other than ecall.

    Since kvm_s390_handle_sigp_pei() is now called for all SIGP orders which
    cause a 108 intercept - even if they are actually handled by
    handle_instruction() - move the tracepoint in kvm_s390_handle_sigp_pei()
    to avoid possibly confusing trace messages.

    KVM: nVMX: Snapshot pre-VM-Enter DEBUGCTL for !nested_run_pending case

    commit 764643a6be07445308e492a528197044c801b3ba upstream.

    If a nested run isn't pending, snapshot vmcs01.GUEST_IA32_DEBUGCTL
    irrespective of whether or not VM_ENTRY_LOAD_DEBUG_CONTROLS is set in
    vmcs12.  When restoring nested state, e.g. after migration, without a
    nested run pending, prepare_vmcs02() will propagate
    nested.vmcs01_debugctl to vmcs02, i.e. will load garbage/zeros into
    vmcs02.GUEST_IA32_DEBUGCTL.

    If userspace restores nested state before MSRs, then loading garbage is a
    non-issue as loading DEBUGCTL will also update vmcs02.  But if usersepace
    restores MSRs first, then KVM is responsible for propagating L2's value,
    which is actually thrown into vmcs01, into vmcs02.

    Restoring L2 MSRs into vmcs01, i.e. loading all MSRs before nested state
    is all kinds of bizarre and ideally would not be supported.  Sadly, some
    VMMs do exactly that and rely on KVM to make things work.

    Note, there's still a lurking SMM bug, as propagating vmcs01's DEBUGCTL
    to vmcs02 across RSM may corrupt L2's DEBUGCTL.  But KVM's entire VMX+SMM
    emulation is flawed as SMI+RSM should not toouch _any_ VMCS when use the
    "default treatment of SMIs", i.e. when not using an SMI Transfer Monitor.

    Similar to the Surface Go (1), the (Elantech) touchscreen/digitizer in
    the Surface Go 2 mistakenly reports the battery of the stylus. Instead
    of over the touchscreen device, battery information is provided via
    bluetooth and the touchscreen device reports an empty battery.

    Apply the HID_BATTERY_QUIRK_IGNORE quirk to ignore this battery and

    lockd: detect and reject lock arguments that overflow

    commit 6930bcbfb6ceda63e298c6af6d733ecdf6bd4cde upstream.

    lockd doesn't currently vet the start and length in nlm4 requests like
    it should, and can end up generating lock requests with arguments that
    overflow when passed to the filesystem.

    The NLM4 protocol uses unsigned 64-bit arguments for both start and
    length, whereas struct file_lock tracks the start and end as loff_t
    values. By the time we get around to calling nlm4svc_retrieve_args,
    we've lost the information that would allow us to determine if there was
    an overflow.

    Start tracking the actual start and len for NLM4 requests in the
    nlm_lock. In nlm4svc_retrieve_args, vet these values to ensure they
    won't cause an overflow, and return NLM4_FBIG if they do.

    add barriers to buffer_uptodate and set_buffer_uptodate

    commit d4252071b97d2027d246f6a82cbee4d52f618b47 upstream.

    Let's have a look at this piece of code in __bread_slow:

            get_bh(bh);
            bh->b_end_io = end_buffer_read_sync;
            submit_bh(REQ_OP_READ, 0, bh);
            wait_on_buffer(bh);
            if (buffer_uptodate(bh))
                    return bh;

    Neither wait_on_buffer nor buffer_uptodate contain any memory barrier.
    Consequently, if someone calls sb_bread and then reads the buffer data,
    the read of buffer data may be executed before wait_on_buffer(bh) on
    architectures with weak memory ordering and it may return invalid data.

    Fix this bug by adding a memory barrier to set_buffer_uptodate and an
    acquire barrier to buffer_uptodate (in a similar way as
    folio_test_uptodate and folio_mark_uptodate).

    And also, a pending packet can be null in hwsim_tx_info_frame_received_nl

    commit 3790a3d6dbbc48e30586e9c3fc752a00e2e11946 upstream.

    The Lenovo Yoga 9 14IAP7 is set up similarly to the Thinkpad X1 7th and

    speakers to NID 0x17, but here the codec misreports the NID 0x17 as
    unconnected.

    The pincfg and hda verbs connect and activate the bass speaker
    amplifiers, but the generic driver will connect them to NID 0x06 which
    has no volume control. Set connection list/preferred connections is
    required to gain volume control.

    commit e086c37f876fd1f551e2b4f9be97d4a1923cd219 upstream.

    Just like other Behringer models, UMC202HD (USB ID 1397:0507) requires
    the quirk for the stable streaming, too.

    nfsd: eliminate the NFSD_FILE_BREAK_* flags

    commit 23ba98de6dcec665e15c0ca19244379bb0d30932 upstream.

    We had a report from the spring Bake-a-thon of data corruption in some
    nfstest_interop tests. Looking at the traces showed the NFS server
    allowing a v3 WRITE to proceed while a read delegation was still
    outstanding.

    Currently, we only set NFSD_FILE_BREAK_* flags if
    NFSD_MAY_NOT_BREAK_LEASE was set when we call nfsd_file_alloc.
    NFSD_MAY_NOT_BREAK_LEASE was intended to be set when finding files for
    COMMIT ops, where we need a writeable filehandle but don't need to
    break read leases.

    It doesn't make any sense to consult that flag when allocating a file
    since the file may be used on subsequent calls where we do want to break
    the lease (and the usage of it here seems to be reverse from what it
    should be anyway).

    Also, after calling nfsd_open_break_lease, we don't want to clear the
    BREAK_* bits. A lease could end up being set on it later (more than
    once) and we need to be able to break those leases as well.

    This means that the NFSD_FILE_BREAK_* flags now just mirror
    NFSD_MAY_{READ,WRITE} flags, so there's no need for them at all. Just
    drop those flags and unconditionally call nfsd_open_break_lease every
    time.

    x86: link vdso and boot with -z noexecstack --no-warn-rwx-segments

    commit ffcf9c5700e49c0aee42dcba9a12ba21338e8136 upstream.

    Users of GNU ld (BFD) from binutils 2.39+ will observe multiple
    instances of a new warning when linking kernels in the form:

      ld: warning: arch/x86/boot/pmjump.o: missing .note.GNU-stack section implies executable stack
      ld: NOTE: This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the linker
      ld: warning: arch/x86/boot/compressed/vmlinux has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions

    Generally, we would like to avoid the stack being executable.  Because
    there could be a need for the stack to be executable, assembler sources
    have to opt-in to this security feature via explicit creation of the
    .note.GNU-stack feature (which compilers create by default) or command
    line flag --noexecstack.  Or we can simply tell the linker the
    production of such sections is irrelevant and to link the stack as
    --noexecstack.

    LLVM's LLD linker defaults to -z noexecstack, so this flag isn't
    strictly necessary when linking with LLD, only BFD, but it doesn't hurt
    to be explicit here for all linkers IMO.  --no-warn-rwx-segments is
    currently BFD specific and only available in the current latest release,
    so it's wrapped in an ld-option check.

    While the kernel makes extensive usage of ELF sections, it doesn't use
    permissions from ELF segments.

ksmbd: validate length in smb2\_write()The SMB2 Write packet contains data that is to be written
to a file or to a pipe. Depending on the client, there may
be padding between the header and the data field.
Currently, the length is validated only in the case padding
is present.
Since the DataOffset field always points to the beginning
of the data, there is no need to have a special case for
padding. By removing this, the length is validated in both
cases.

ksmbd: validate length in smb2\_write()

```
The SMB2 Write packet contains data that is to be written
to a file or to a pipe. Depending on the client, there may
be padding between the header and the data field.
Currently, the length is validated only in the case padding
is present.

Since the DataOffset field always points to the beginning
of the data, there is no need to have a special case for
padding. By removing this, the length is validated in both
cases.
