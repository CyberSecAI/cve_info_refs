Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `gf_vvc_read_pps_bs_internal` function located in `media_tools/av_parsers.c`. The code iterates through tiles, calculating their heights, and stores these heights in the `pps->tile_rows_height_ctb` array. The vulnerability occurs because the loop does not check if `pps->num_tile_rows` exceeds the array's bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `pps->tile_rows_height_ctb` array, which has a fixed size of 33, can be written past its boundary when the number of tile rows exceeds the allocated space.
- **Missing bounds check:** The code lacks proper bounds checking before writing to the `pps->tile_rows_height_ctb` array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow leads to a crash, potentially causing a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The provided report mentions the possibility of remote code execution, although it is not explicitly demonstrated within the report.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted MP4 Files:** By providing a specifically crafted MP4 file with a large number of tile rows.
- **File Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable code processes the crafted MP4 file using the `MP4Box` tool. Specifically, the command used to trigger is `MP4Box import -add poc_bof2.mp4`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious MP4 file.
- The attacker needs to induce the vulnerable software (GPAC) to process the malicious MP4 file.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected code is located in the file `media_tools/av_parsers.c`, specifically the `gf_vvc_read_pps_bs_internal` function.
- The vulnerable array is `pps->tile_rows_height_ctb`, which is an array of `u32` with a size of 33.
- The vulnerability was discovered using the Address Sanitizer.
- A proof of concept (POC) file, `poc_bof2.mp4`, is provided to reproduce the issue.
- The issue was fixed in commit `4876076`.
