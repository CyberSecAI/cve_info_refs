- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress My Calendar plugin versions <= 3.3.24.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could include actions such as modifying settings, creating new events, or deleting data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a forged HTTP request triggered by an attacker, which is then executed within the context of an authenticated user's session. This typically involves tricking the user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website containing the forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests and successfully trick a logged-in user into triggering the request. The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the WordPress site itself.
