- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cart Lift plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow the attacker to inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts would be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into user-controlled input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
