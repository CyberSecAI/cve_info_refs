The provided content is related to CVE-2022-47311.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within a proprietary protocol used by iBoot devices for control and keepalive commands. The authentication mechanism for this protocol incorrectly handles user authentication, allowing a bypass when a non-existent user is specified, leading to unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication bypass due to improper validation of user existence and credentials in the proprietary protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to device configurations and potentially control over the device.
- The impact includes a compromise of confidentiality (access to information) and partial integrity loss (potential to modify settings).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack through the proprietary protocol used for control and keepalive commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the iBoot device.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the proprietary protocol used by the device.
- The attacker must be able to send specially crafted messages using the proprietary protocol.
- A low level of privilege is required for successful exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in Dataprobe iBoot-PDU devices.
- The advisory indicates that the vulnerability is present in all versions prior to 1.42.06162022, and has been patched in version 1.43.03312023.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specific control messages using a proprietary protocol, bypassing authentication if the user does not exist and sending default values.
- The CVSS v3 score is 8.5 which indicates High severity.
