```
macro_rules! eprintln {

    ($($arg:tt)*) => { ... };
}
```
Expand description

Prints to the standard error, with a newline.

Equivalent to the [`println!`](macro.println.html "macro std::println") macro, except that output goes to
[`io::stderr`](io/fn.stderr.html "fn std::io::stderr") instead of [`io::stdout`](io/fn.stdout.html "fn std::io::stdout"). See [`println!`](macro.println.html "macro std::println") for
example usage.

Use `eprintln!` only for error and progress messages. Use `println!`
instead for the primary output of your program.

See [the formatting documentation in `std::fmt`](../std/fmt/index.html)
for details of the macro argument syntax.

## [√Ç¬ß](#panics)Panics

Panics if writing to `io::stderr` fails.

Writing to non-blocking stderr can cause an error, which will lead
this macro to panic.

## [√Ç¬ß](#examples)Examples

```
eprintln!("Error: Could not complete task");
```

| Hello guys, when I tried to review the implementation of `filter_trampoline_unwindsafe()`, I found that the function would call `print_panic` to print out the error message as following.   [ostree/rust-bindings/src/repo\_checkout\_at\_options/repo\_checkout\_filter.rs](https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/blob/0dbd87c01724e1c2291c693eec255b068b4856a8/rust-bindings/src/repo_checkout_at_options/repo_checkout_filter.rs#L101)  Line 101 in [0dbd87c](/ostreedev/ostree/commit/0dbd87c01724e1c2291c693eec255b068b4856a8)   |  | print\_panic(panic); | | --- | --- |      `print_panic` would call `eprintln!` to print out error message. However, based on the documentation of `eprintln`(<https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.eprintln.html>), it will trigger panic if writing to `io::stderr` fails. This would cause to another unwinding out of `catch_unwind()`, and become undefined behavior when unwinding reaches the "C" ABI boundary.  Do you think such potential risk exist? Thanks. |

| Ah. Neat find! I'm guessing you're running some sort of static analysis tool?  I think we can fix this by directly invoking <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.StderrLock.html#method.write> ?  Do you want to try a PR? |

| Actually, I am trying to find some elegant use catch\_unwind() on github. Your code comes to my sight because the repo is popular.  Ah, heh. Well to be honest I didn't personally write that code; it dates to <https://gitlab.com/fkrull/ostree-rs/-/commit/2cf6602f973a8af4b45cb9d04e31496a127ffc49>  For idiomatic use of `catch_unwind`...I'm not sure it's the best; what's your goal? To do the same thing and just print it to stderr?  Anyways, I did a PR in [#2776](https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/pull/2776) |

| Yes. I saw your PR.  It seems that `write_all` would still possibly return variant of `ErrorKind`. It would be swallowed by the assigned variable `_`. However, I think it is much better than unexpected `panic!`. |

| [@shinmao](https://github.com/shinmao) yes there is still a chance of hitting error cases in that scenario, but I don't see a better way of handling them over discarding them behind `_`. We'll merge this code for now, but if any better idea comes up feel free to ping here. |

| Hi, is it possible for you guys to help me report issue to RUSTSEC? I am a security researcher trying to build some tools, and I might need some results on CVE/RUSTSEC to evaluate my tools. Though the issue has been closed, could you help me to explain the importance of finding this issue?  In `filter_trampoline_unwindsafe()`, what would happen if panics escaped to C function? I know unwinding from Rust function to foreign function is still undefined behavior. In your application scenario, will crash or something more serious happen? |
