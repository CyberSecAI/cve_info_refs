Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a hidden functionality (backdoor) within the `slcore` component of Solar-Log devices. This backdoor allows for bypassing the regular authentication process and gaining unauthorized access to privileged functionalities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-912: Hidden Functionality:** The core issue is the presence of a secondary authentication pathway not intended for regular users.
*   **Predictable Password Generation:** The backdoor uses a predictable algorithm to generate a password based on the device's serial number and current date/time, both of which are easily obtainable.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerable code allows specific "support" or "embedded" profiles with super admin privileges to be accessed through the backdoor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain super admin access to the device.
*   **Data Manipulation:** This access allows the attacker to manipulate device settings, access sensitive data, and potentially disrupt the PV monitoring system.
*   **Remote Access:** The attack can be performed remotely, affecting thousands of devices reachable over the internet.
*  **Configuration Changes**: Access to restricted menus, configurations, database, and driver functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the device's web interface.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is needed; the attacker can directly use the generated password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Solar-Log device.
*   **Knowledge of the Algorithm:** The attacker needs to understand how the backdoor password is generated, but this information is not directly shared in the advisory and is obtained by reverse engineering the `slcore` binary.
*   **Device Serial Number and Date/Time**: The attacker needs to know the serial number and current date/time. The serial number is exposed on the login page of the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Solar-Log devices running `slcore` component versions 4.2.7 up to 5.1.1 (inclusive).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Swascan during a Penetration Testing activity.
*   The vendor, Solar-Log GmbH, has released firmware versions 5.1.2_156 and 4.2.8_117 to remediate this issue.
*   The advisory includes detailed steps of the reverse engineering process, including extracting the firmware from the NAND flash memory and analyzing the binary using Ghidra.
