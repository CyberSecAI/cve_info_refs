Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and its fix:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) URLs within subframes (iframes). Specifically, the browser was attempting to commit navigation to `ipfs://` URLs in subframes, which could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior because these URLs need to be translated into proper gateway URLs before navigation.
*   **Weakness:** The browser lacked a mechanism to prevent subframe navigations to `ipfs://` and `ipns://` URLs.
*   **Impact:** The primary impact of this vulnerability was browser crashes. An attacker could craft a malicious webpage containing an iframe with an `ipfs://` or `ipns://` URL, leading to a crash when the page is loaded in the browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves a malicious webpage that contains an iframe using an `ipfs://` or `ipns://` URL in its `src` attribute.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to host a webpage with the malicious iframe content.

**Fix:**

*   **Mitigation:** A new `IpfsSubframeNavigationThrottle` was introduced to prevent subframe navigations with `ipfs://` and `ipns://` schemes. This throttle cancels and ignores the subframe navigation, preventing the browser from trying to commit the direct IPFS/IPNS navigation. This ensures that subframes will not directly navigate to IPFS resources without proper gateway redirection.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   `browser/brave_content_browser_client.cc`: The `IpfsSubframeNavigationThrottle` is added to the navigation throttles.
    *   `browser/ipfs/ipfs_subframe_navigation_throttle.cc`: Implements the logic to cancel subframe navigation of IPFS/IPNS URLs.
    *   `browser/ipfs/ipfs_subframe_navigation_throttle.h`: Defines the throttle class.
    *   `browser/ipfs/sources.gni`: Includes the new throttle files in the build.
    *   `browser/ipfs/test/ipfs_service_browsertest.cc`: Adds new tests to verify that subframe IPFS navigation is blocked.
    *   `browser/net/ipfs_redirect_network_delegate_helper.cc`: Modified to prevent IPFS requests in incognito mode without URL translation.
    *   `browser/net/ipfs_redirect_network_delegate_helper_unittest.cc`: Adds tests to verify incognito mode blocking.
*   **Additional Notes:**
    *   The fix was backported to the 1.43.x release branch.
    *   The fix includes test cases to prevent regressions.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne.
*   The fix was implemented in pull request #14313 in the `brave-core` repository.
*   The related browser issue is #24211 in the `brave-browser` repository.
*   The fix was also uplifted to 1.43.x.
*   The fix prevents the browser crashes, ensuring that IPFS resources within subframes are loaded through proper gateway redirection.
*   The tests added verify that the fix prevents subframes from loading directly from ipfs:// or ipns:// urls, and instead, they will fail to load (resulting in a chrome-error://chromewebdata/ url).
*   The commit message for the fix is "Do not commit subframe navigations for ipfs (uplift to 1.43.x)".
