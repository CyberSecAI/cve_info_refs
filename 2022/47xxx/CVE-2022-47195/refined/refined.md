The provided content is related to CVE-2022-47195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insecure default configuration in Ghost CMS, specifically the lack of input sanitization on user profile fields and post creation fields. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "facebook" field of a user profile.
- Insecure default configuration allows for privilege escalation via XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary Javascript code.
- Privilege escalation to administrator level by tricking an administrator into visiting a page with the malicious code.
- In default installations of Ghost CMS, users that can author pages and administrator users have the same privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with minimal privileges can inject malicious Javascript into the "facebook" field.
- The injected code is triggered when a higher-privilege user (e.g. an administrator) views the attacker's profile or a post where the injected code is present.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account with the ability to modify the "facebook" field.
- The attacker requires a higher-privilege user to access a page containing the malicious JavaScript.
