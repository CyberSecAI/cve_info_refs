The provided content is related to CVE-2022-47196.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insecure default configuration in Ghost CMS that allows a user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `codeinjection_head` field of a post. This is due to a lack of input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `codeinjection_head` field.
- Insecure default configuration that does not prevent basic users from injecting javascript in posts.
- Lack of proper input sanitization in the `codeinjection_head` field when creating a post.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of a logged-in user's browser.
- Privilege escalation: An attacker can potentially elevate their privileges to administrator by tricking an administrator into viewing a crafted post.
- In default installations, this means that users that can author pages and administrator users have the same privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ghost/api/admin/posts/` endpoint to create a new post with malicious javascript payload in the `codeinjection_head` field.
- The injected javascript payload will execute when a user previews or visits the malicious post.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a basic user account (e.g., Contributor, Author) to create a post.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Ghost server, typically through a web browser.
- The attacker needs to trick a higher privileged user (e.g. Administrator) into previewing or visiting the malicious post.
