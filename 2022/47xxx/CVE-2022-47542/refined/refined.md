Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper access control within SQL Monitor, specifically in versions prior to 12.1.54.
*   In versions prior to 12.1.46, the vulnerability was present when Active Directory (LDAP) authentication was configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Low-privileged users (read-only, standard, or reporting) could gain administrative rights within SQL Monitor. This was particularly true for systems using Active Directory (LDAP) authentication before version 12.1.46.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:**  Low-privileged users could perform actions beyond their granted access level.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Changes:** Low-privileged users could modify SQL Monitor settings, which normally require higher access levels.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In versions prior to 12.1.46 using LDAP, users could modify SQL Monitor user rights assignments, allowing them to become administrators within SQL Monitor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector requires a valid user account within SQL Monitor.
*   The attacker must be a low-privileged user (e.g., read-only, standard, or reporting access).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for SQL Monitor.
*   The attacker needs to be a non-administrator user within SQL Monitor.
*   For the privilege escalation vulnerability, the system must be configured to use Active Directory (LDAP) authentication in versions prior to 12.1.46.

**Additional Details:**

*   Redgate assigned a CVSS 3.1 score of 7.6 (high) to the elevation of privilege vulnerability. Other vulnerabilities are rated as medium or lower.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during routine penetration testing.
*   There is no evidence of exploitation in the wild.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in SQL Monitor version 12.1.54. The privilege escalation vulnerability was fixed in versions 12.1.46 and later, and 11.2.21.
