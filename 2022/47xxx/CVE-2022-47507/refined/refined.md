Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-47507:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data within the SolarWinds Platform. This vulnerability stems from the platform's failure to properly validate data during the deserialization process, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code through a crafted payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Deserialization of Untrusted Data: The core weakness is the insecure handling of deserialized data, which enables the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the SolarWinds Platform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attack can be performed remotely.
- Network access to the SolarWinds Platform web console is required

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- SolarWinds Admin-level Account Access: The attacker needs to have valid admin-level account access to the SolarWinds Web Console and messaging service.
