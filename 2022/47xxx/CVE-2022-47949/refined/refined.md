The provided content is related to CVE-2022-47949.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the `NetworkBuffer` class used in the network library `enl` (or `Net` in Mario Kart 7) of various first-party Nintendo games. The `Add` and `Set` methods of this class do not check if the input data size exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in `NetworkBuffer::Add` and `NetworkBuffer::Set` methods.
- Lack of input validation on `newDataSize` in `memcpy`.
- Asynchronous network library using double buffering, which is exploited to overwrite data.
- Absence of ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) in 3DS games makes exploitation easier as memory locations are predictable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) on the victim's console.
- Ability to take full control of the console.
- Possible theft of account/credit card information.
- Unauthorized audio/video recording using console's built-in mic/cameras.
- In some less severe cases, memory corruption leading to application crashes or minor disruptions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Online multiplayer game sessions where the attacker can send crafted network packets to the victim's console.
- Exploitation through "communities" feature in Mario Kart 7, allowing for isolated testing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to join an online game session with the victim.
- Ability to craft malicious network packets with specific size and data payload.
- Knowledge of memory layout (especially for 3DS exploits due to lack of ASLR) to target specific memory addresses.
- In the case of switch, the attacker needs to be able to read memory leaks.
