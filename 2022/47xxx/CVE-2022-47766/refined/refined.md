The attacker can potentially achieve command execution, data theft, or defacement of the web site.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the administration panel of the application, specifically using the file upload feature on the plugin management page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires access to the administrative backend of the PopojiCMS application to upload the malicious zip file. The attacker also needs to prepare a malicious zip file containing php code"
