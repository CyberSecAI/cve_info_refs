# Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Policy

[Report a vulnerability](https://rapid7.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new?ticket_form=vulnerability_disclosure)

**Rapid7’s Vulnerability Research and Disclosure Principles**

* **We believe in strengthening defense by democratizing access to attacker tooling and knowledge.** One of Rapid7’s unique strengths is our deep knowledge of how attackers work. Our vulnerability research and Metasploit teams strive to make attacker capabilities that would otherwise be used primarily by criminals accessible to all — enabling defenders to understand and prioritize critical vulnerabilities, develop detections and mitigations, and test security controls. Releasing public exploit code and novel research is core to our mission to close the security achievement gap.
* **Public disclosure of vulnerabilities is a critical component of a healthy cybersecurity ecosystem.** Rapid7 practices and advocates for timely public disclosure of vulnerabilities across both third-party products and our own systems and solutions. This includes vulnerabilities we independently discover in our customers’ tech stacks. Through transparent, open, and timely vulnerability disclosures, Rapid7 helps the entire internet protect and defend those assets and services critical to modern civilization.
* **In today’s threat landscape, organizations need timely information about risk in order to make educated choices about protecting their networks — especially during active attacks.** Our coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy includes explicit provisions for speeding up public disclosure in cases where exploitation has been observed in the wild. Vendors often (understandably) act to protect their own businesses and reputations when there are security issues in their products that introduce risk into their downstream customers’ environments. When we know about exploitation in the wild, or when we believe that threat actors may be covertly weaponizing non-public vulnerabilities, our priority is to make customers and the community aware of that risk so they may take action to protect their organizations.

**Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Policy**

In keeping with standard industry practices around Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) (such as [CERT/CC's](https://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm), [Google's](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/01/policy-and-disclosure-2020-edition.html), [ZDI's](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/)), as well as the standards promulgated in [ISO 29147](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) and [ISO 30111](https://www.iso.org/standard/69725.html), Rapid7 will typically prepare and publish advisories detailing newly discovered vulnerabilities approximately 60 days after our initial attempts at private disclosure, barring extenuating circumstances (including those outlined below which may warrant different disclosure guidelines). These advisories will be made publicly available via Rapid7’s [blog](/blog/tag/vulnerability-disclosure/) and social media. Depending on the details of the findings, there may also be media engagement.

While coordinated vulnerability disclosure can differ from bug to bug depending on a wide range of circumstances, Rapid7's primary concern is getting vulnerabilities fixed and making affected parties aware of the risks associated with vulnerabilities. In keeping with the principles outlined above, Rapid7 has identified several common types of vulnerabilities, each of which warrants slightly different disclosure guidelines.

Please note, technical vulnerabilities often involve [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) and unexpected interactions. Therefore, Rapid7 may modify the timeline for disclosure at our sole discretion due to unique or unpredictable elements of that specific vulnerability.

**All Vulnerabilities (The Default Policy)**

* Rapid7 will confidentially disclose discovered vulnerabilities to the organization that is in the best position to address that vulnerability with a resolution. That organization is the "responsible organization."

+ If the responsible organization is not a [CVE Partner](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners), Rapid7 will reserve a CVE ID.

* After 15 days, Rapid7 will inform CERT/CC of the vulnerability with enough technical detail to demonstrate the issue. If the responsible organization has not acknowledged our initial disclosure by this time, Rapid7 will presume they are a "non-responsive responsible organization."
* After 60 days of confidential disclosure to the responsible organization, Rapid7 will publicly disclose vulnerability information, including CVE descriptions, opinions on risk, impact, and mitigation strategies, and enough technical detail to demonstrate the issue (collectively, "vulnerability details"). Rapid7 may involve media outlets in that disclosure.

+ During this 60 day window, Rapid7 expects the responsible organization will develop a resolution and make any update available for affected parties, and Rapid7 will keep CERT/CC apprised of the status of those updates.
+ If the responsible organization is showing consistent good-faith effort to develop and ship an update, but cannot complete this work within 60 days, a 30-day extension may be granted at Rapid7’s sole discretion under the Default Policy (or for any of the enumerated exceptions below).

* If Rapid7 becomes aware that an update was made generally available after reporting the issue to the responsible organization, including [silent patches](/blog/post/2022/06/06/the-hidden-harm-of-silent-patches/) which tend to hijack CVD norms, Rapid7 will aim to publish vulnerability details within 24 hours.
* Issues that are confidentially rediscovered and reported to the responsible organization as duplicates have no bearing on the timeline expectations of this policy.

**Exploited In the Wild***This is the case where we see active exploitation in a production environment, including our own. The goal in these situations is to release critical information about risk as quickly as possible so organizations may take informed action to protect themselves.*

This policy is identical to the default policy but for these changes:

* Rapid7 will aim to notify CERT/CC and publish public vulnerability information approximately 72 hours after discovery, regardless of the existence of an update.
* If the vulnerability was found within an organization’s environment, Rapid7 will strive to notify directly affected organizations of the disclosure first.

**Patch Bypasses***This is the case where a vendor believes they fixed an issue, but didn't.*

This policy is identical to the Exploited In the Wild policy but for these changes:

* A new CVE ID will be reserved that references the original CVE ID.
* Rapid7 will inform the responsible organization and CERT/CC concurrently.
* Depending on the nature of the bypass, Rapid7 may release vulnerability details immediately, or up to 45 days after reporting to CERT/CC.

**Cloud/Hosted Vulnerabilities***This is the case where end users or implementors have nothing to fix on their end — fixing the issue requires only one responsible organization to act.*

This policy is identical to the default policy but for these changes:

* A CVE ID will not be reserved by Rapid7.
* If the issue is resolved inside the 60 day coordination window, Rapid7 will assess the value of a public disclosure. If the issue remains unresolved after the coordination window closes, a public disclosure may be issued per the default policy.

**Kinetic Vulnerabilities***These are vulnerabilities that have obvious and direct implications for human health and safety, and are not otherwise present in generally-used technology. Specialized OT and medical technology fall into this category.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will disclose vulnerability details 30 days after the general availability of the update, instead of immediately.

+ If the vulnerability becomes actively exploited in the wild, the Exploited in the Wild policy shall apply instead.

* Rapid7 will coordinate with relevant government agencies that are in a position to work with the responsible organization to develop, distribute and implement updates (including CERT/CC).
* Coordination with CERT/CC and the responsible organization may be extended for up to 180 days. If there is no update available after 180 days, Rapid7 will publish vulnerability details.

**Low-Impact Vulnerabilities***These vulnerabilities are trivial enough that an exploit would cause safely ignorable consequences to affected production environments, or limited to a single production instance, such as one website not connected to* [*critical infrastructure*](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors)*, or extant in only theoretical or very unlikely configurations of affected systems.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will not coordinate with CERT/CC.
* Rapid7 may not publish vulnerability details at any point, but may do so if circumstances change (for example, if it's shown that this low-impact vulnerability can be chained with another to achieve a high-impact result).

**Vulnerabilities with No Responsible Organization***These are vulnerabilities in obsolete systems, abandoned software packages, or maintained by non-responsive responsible organizations.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will publish vulnerability details 45 days after providing CERT/CC vulnerability details, or on a timeline that is agreed upon with CERT/CC.

**Multi-Faceted Vulnerabilities***These vulnerabilities match more than one non-default category, such as a vulnerability for unsupported software that is exploited in the wild.*

* If there is a conflict in timelines, the shorter timeline shall apply.

## Introduction

**ONLYOFFICE Workspace** is a paidfree version of collaborative system developed to manage documents, projects, customer relationship and email correspondence, all in one place.

**ONLYOFFICE Workspace** is shipped as an automatic installation script for Linux operating systems with Docker installed. The script will set up Docker containers with all the components necessary for **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** correct work and is easy to run, manage and update.

This guide will show you how to install **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** to your machine using the provided Docker script. Alternatively, you can run this script and select an option to install **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** [from RPM/DEB packages](/server/linux/opensource/opensource-script-rpm-deb-installation.aspx). Alternatively, you can run this script and select an option to install **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** [from RPM/DEB packages](/server/linux/opensource/opensource-script-rpm-deb-installation.aspx).

## System requirements

* CPU
  at least **4-core** (**6-core** recommended)
* RAM
  at least **8 GB** (**12 GB** recommended)
* HDD
  at least **40 GB** of free space
* Additional requirements
  at least **6 GB** of swap
* OS
  **amd64** Linux distribution with kernel version **3.10** or later

Though running **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** is a very resourceful operation, you will not have to allocate swap space before you start installation. When you run the installation script, a **6 Gb** swap file is created automatically.

## Getting ONLYOFFICE Workspace script

Download **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** Docker script file. You can do that using our site [download page](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-workspace.aspx?from=helpcenter#workspace-community)[download page](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-workspace.aspx?from=helpcenter#workspace-enterprise). Or the direct download link can be used, if it is more convenient for you:

```
wget https://download.onlyoffice.com/install/workspace-enterprise-install.sh

```

```
wget https://download.onlyoffice.com/install/workspace-install.sh

```

Once the download is finished, you can start the installation process.

## Running complete installation of ONLYOFFICE Workspace

Please note that all installation actions must be performed with **root** rights.

You can install all **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** components and modules at once. To do that run the following command:

```
bash workspace-enterprise-install.sh -md "yourdomain.com"

```

```
bash workspace-install.sh -md "yourdomain.com"

```

Where `yourdomain.com` is your own domain that will be used for **ONLYOFFICE Mail**.

Your domain that will be used for maintaining correspondence must be valid and configured for this machine (i.e. it should have the appropriate **A record** in the DNS settings that points your domain name to the IP address of the machine where **ONLYOFFICE Mail** is installed).
In the command above, the `"yourdomain.com"` parameter must be understood as a **service domain for Mail Server**. It is usually specified in the **MX record** of the domain that will be used for maintaining correspondence. As a rule, the `"yourdomain.com"` looks like `mx1.onlyoffice.com`

If you do not have a domain name or simply want to install **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** for your local server, you can install it without **ONLYOFFICE Mail**. In case you plan to add it later, you will be able to do that from **Control Panel**.

For the **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** to be able to run the Docker service is necessary. The installation script will check if it is present on the computer and its version is not less than the minimal required. Otherwise the Docker will be installed or updated automatically.

Docker specifies Google DNS servers by default. If your **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** server is not going to have access to the Internet, we recommend that you change the default Docker DNS address to the address of your local DNS server. To do that go to the `/etc/default/docker` file and change the IP address in the following line to the IP address of a DNS server in your local network:
```
docker_OPTS="--dns 8.8.8.8"

```

For the RPM based operating systems like CentOS:

1. Create the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` configuration file with the following contents:
   ```
   { "dns" : [ "8.8.8.8" ] }

   ```
2. Restart the Docker service:
   ```

   sudo systemctl restart docker.service

   ```

## Running ONLYOFFICE Workspace installation without ONLYOFFICE Mail

In case you do not want to install **ONLYOFFICE Mail** just now, you can skip its installation. To do that run the following command:

```
bash workspace-enterprise-install.sh -ims false

```

```
bash workspace-install.sh -ims false

```

This will install **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** without **ONLYOFFICE Mail**. You can add it later from **Control Panel**, please see the [documentation article](/server/controlpanel/opensource/install-mail-server.aspx) to learn how this can be done.

The list of all available script parameters is avaiable with the below command:
```
bash workspace-enterprise-install.sh -h

```

```
bash workspace-install.sh -h

```

If you choose to run the installation with some additional parameters, please do not skip **Control Panel** installation, otherwise you will not be able to enter your license key after the installation is finished and add, for instance, **ONLYOFFICE Mail** to your **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** instance.

To learn more on how to use all the available script parameters, please refer to [this article](/server/docker/opensource/opensource-script-parameters.aspx).

Once the installation is finished you can check **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** for correct work. Open a browser and enter the **local network** computer IP address (please do not use either localhost or 127.0.0.1 network address for the same computer where you have **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** installed, use its IP address in the local network instead) to the browser address bar. **ONLYOFFICE Workspace** must be up and running indicating the successful installation.

# Multiple DMS XSS (CVE-2022-47412 through CVE-20222-47419)

* Feb 07, 2023
* 13 min read
* [Tod Beardsley](/blog/author/tod-beardsley/)

*Last updated at Wed, 12 Apr 2023 22:18:25 GMT*

Through the course of routine security testing and analysis, Rapid7 has discovered several issues in on-premises installations of open source and freemium Document Management System (DMS) offerings from four vendors. While all of the discovered issues are instances of [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation, in this disclosure, we have ordered them from most severe to least.

The issues are summarized in the table below.

| Vendor | Product | Version | CVE | Patched? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ONLYOFFICE | Workspace | 12.1.0.1760 | [CVE-2022-47412](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2022-47412) | [v7.3.3](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#733) |

All of these issues were discovered by Rapid7 researcher [Matthew Kienow](https://github.com/mkienow-r7), and validated by Rapid7's security sciences team. Unfortunately, none of these vendors were able to respond to Rapid7's disclosure outreach, despite having coordinated these disclosures with [CERT/CC](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/). As such, these issues are being disclosed in accordance with Rapid7's [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.rapid7.com/security/disclosure/#zeroday). When we become aware of patches or vendor advisories, we will update this advisory with that information.

## CVE-2022-47412: ONLYOFFICE Workspace Search Stored XSS

Given a malicious document provided by an attacker, the ONLYOFFICE Workspace DMS is vulnerable to a stored (persistent, or "Type II") cross-site scripting (XSS) condition.

### Product Description

ONLYOFFICE Workspace is an AGPL licensed DMS, available as an on-prem or cloud-hosted collaboration platform. Read more about ONLYOFFICE at [the vendor's website](https://www.onlyoffice.com/#:~:text=Learn%20more-,ONLYOFFICE%20Workspace).

This vulnerability was identified in testing against ONLYOFFICE Workspace Version 12.1.0.1760. It is likely the vulnerability exists in previous versions of the software as well as the Enterprise offering. The test instance was installed using the Docker image and the instructions for installing ONLYOFFICE Workspace using the [provided script](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/workspace-install-docker.aspx).

### CVE-2022-47412 Exploitation

The attack hinges on the ability of the attacker to get a document saved in the DMS for indexing. The details of how this might happen are going to vary significantly between sites, ranging from an email or web-based portal for submitting documents automatically to the target organization, to convincing a human operator to manually save the malicious document on behalf of the attacker, to an insider indexing their own document and waiting for another user to trigger the XSS condition.

Once indexed, the attacker then needs to wait for, or convince, a user to trigger the stored document via the search functionality provided by ONLYOFFICE Workspace. One technique to ensure success would be to create a document with several commonly searched-for terms, which will depend on the target organization's industry, commonly spoken language, and other factors.

Reproduction of the issue is straightforward:

1. Upload or create a new document that contains the following two lines of text and tags:

```
One <img src/onerror=alert('XSS-doc-1')> two
Three <script>alert('XSS-doc-2')</script> four

```

2. Select the document and open it with either the edit or preview option. For example, `/Products/Files/DocEditor.aspx?fileid=11` is a typical path.
3. Open the search panel by clicking the magnifying glass icon on the left side of the editor.
4. Type one of the words on either side of the tag (one, two, three, or four) and it will cause the related XSS to execute in the user’s web browser.

### Impact

Once an attacker has provided a malicious document, and a suitable victim has triggered the XSS condition, the attacker has several avenues for furthering their control over the target organization. A typical attack pattern would be to steal the session cookie that a locally-logged in administrator is authenticated with, and reuse that session cookie to impersonate that user to create a new privileged account.

A slightly more subtle and extensible attack would be to hook the victim's browser session and inject the attacker's own commands under the identity of the hooked user, using [BeEF](https://beefproject.com/) or similar post-exploitation tooling.

Once enabled, the attacker would have access to the stored documents, which may be critically important to the targeted organization.

### Remediation

In the absence of an update from the vendor, users of the affected DMS should take care when importing documents from unknown or untrusted sources. Of course, many modern workflows depend on cataloging inbound documents, so this advice should be backed up with a robust document scanner that automatically searches for common XSS patterns embedded in documents. XSS filter evasion is a constantly evolving field, but a reasonable scanner should be able to at least pick out common XSS patterns.

Given the high severity of a stored XSS vulnerability in a document management system, especially one that is often part of automated workflows, administrators are urged to apply any vendor-supplied updates on an emergency basis.

### Disclosure Timeline

* October-November: Research project on DMS vulnerabilities initiated by Matthew Kienow
* Thu, Dec 1, 2022: Initial notification to the vendor via guessed email addresses and support channels.
* Fri, Dec 2, 2022: Support ticket #37150 suggests emailing security@onlyoffice.com
* Mon, Dec 5, 2022: Provided details to the vendor
* Fri, Dec 16, 2022: Details disclosed to CERT/CC via [VINCE](https://www.kb.cert.org/vince/) (VRF#22-12-LFBLV)
* Tue, Feb 7, 2023: Public disclosure
* Thu, Mar 16, 2023: ONLYOFFICE communicated their fix in [v7.3.3](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#733), released March 15, 2023

## CVE-2022-47413, CVE-2022-47414: OpenKM Document and Application XSS

Two XSS vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenKM, a popular DMS.

Given a malicious document provided by an attacker, the OpenKM DMS is vulnerable to a stored (persistent, or "Type II") XSS condition.

For the second issue, direct access to OpenKM is required in order for the attacker to craft a malicious "note" attached to a stored document.

### Product Description

OpenKM is a GPL licensed DMS, available as an on-prem or cloud-hosted collaboration platform. Read more about OpenKM at [the vendor's website](https://www.openkm.us/#:~:text=SUBMIT-,Document%20Management%20System,-With%20OpenKM%2C%20turn).

These vulnerabilities were identified in testing against OpenKM Version 6.3.12 (build: a3587ce). It is likely the vulnerability exists in previous versions of the software. The tested instance was installed using the Docker image and the installation instructions.

### CVE-2022-47413 Exploitation

The attack hinges on the ability of the attacker to get a document saved in the DMS for indexing. The details of how this might happen are going to vary significantly between sites, ranging from an email or web-based portal for submitting documents automatically to the target organization, to convincing a human operator to manually save the malicious document on behalf of the attacker, to an insider indexing their own document and waiting for another user to trigger the XSS condition.

Once indexed, the attacker then needs to wait for, or convince, a user to trigger the stored document via either direct navigation to the document, or the search functionality provided by OpenKM. One technique to ensure success would be to create a document with several commonly searched-for terms, which will depend on the target organization's industry, commonly spoken language, and other factors.

Reproduction of the issue is straightforward:

1. Create a PDF and a text file that contains the following line of text and tag:

```
One <img src/onerror=alert('XSS-doc-1')> two

```

2. Upload both documents
3. A user that selects the text document will trigger the XSS to execute in their web browser. This does not require the Preview tab to be selected, and it will trigger when the default tab, Properties, is selected.
4. The stored XSS in the document will also execute via a search

   a. Click the Search tab and check the “View advanced mode” checkbox

   b. On the Basic tab, change the Context drop-down to “My documents”

   c. In the Content field enter one of the words on either side of the tag (one or two)

   d. Click the Search button.

   e. The XSS will execute in the user’s web browser as long as the document was included in the displayed search results.

### CVE-2022-47414 Exploitation

If an attacker has access to the console for OpenKM (and is authenticated), a stored XSS vulnerability is reachable in the document "note" functionality. Reproduction of the issue is below.

1. Upload or navigate to a document in the system and click to select it.
2. In the lower panel click the Notes tab and enter a tag such as `<img src/onerror=alert('XSS-doc-note')> in the note field.`
3. Click the Add button
4. A user that selects this document will trigger the XSS to execute in their web browser. This does not require the Notes tab to be selected, and it will trigger when the default tab, Properties, is selected.

### Impact

Once a suitable victim has triggered one of the described XSS conditions, the attacker has several avenues for furthering their control over the target organization. A typical attack pattern would be to steal the session cookie a locally-logged in administrator is authenticated with, and reuse that session cookie to impersonate that user to create a new privileged account.

A slightly more subtle and extensible attack would be to hook the victim's browser session and inject the attacker's own commands under the identity of the hooked user, using [BeEF](https://beefproject.com/) or similar post-exploitation tooling.

Once enabled, the attacker would then have access to the stored documents, which may be critically important to the targeted organization.

### Remediation

For the first issue, in the absence of an update from the vendor, users of the affected DMS should take care when importing documents from unknown or untrusted sources. Of course, many modern workflows depend on cataloging inbound documents, so this advice should be backed up with a robust document scanner that automatically searches for common XSS patterns embedded in documents. XSS filter evasion is a constantly evolving field, but a reasonable scanner should be able to at least pick out common XSS patterns.

For the second issue, in the absence of an update from the vendor, administrators should limit the creation of untrusted users for the affected DMS, since all users have access to the note creation system by default. Until a patch or updated is provided by the vendor, only known, trusted users of the DMS should be permitted to use the tagging features of the application.

Given the high severity of a stored XSS vulnerability in a document management system, especially one that is often part of automated workflows, administrators are urged to apply any vendor-supplied updates on an emergency basis.

## CVE-2022-47415 through CVE-2022-47418: LogicalDOC Multiple Stored XSS

Four XSS vulnerabilities were discovered in the LogicalDOC DMS. Successful XSS exploitation was observed in the in-product messaging system, the chat system, stored document file name indexes, and stored document version comments.

### Product Description

LogicalDOC Community Edition is an LGPL licensed document management system (DMS), available as an on-prem or cloud-hosted collaboration platform. Read more about LogicalDOC at [the vendor's website](https://www.LogicalDOC.com/product/overview).

These vulnerabilities were identified in testing against LogicalDOC Enterprise version 8.8.2 and Community version 8.7.3. It is likely the vulnerability exists in previous versions of the software. The instances tested were installed using the Docker images and the [Community installation](https://github.com/LogicalDOC/docker-ce) and [Enterprise installation](https://docs.LogicalDOC.com/en/installation/install-with-docker) instructions.

### Exploitation

The XSS issues identified in LogicalDOC each have their own unique vectors for attacker utility. All require some level of access to the DMS system itself, though "Guest" access is often sufficient to target administrators.

### CVE-2022-47415 Exploitation

CVE-2022-47415 is a stored XSS in the in-app messaging system (both subject and bodies of the messages). Reproduction steps are detailed below.

1. Click messages tab
2. Click Send message button
3. Enter one or more Recipients
4. In the subject field enter a tag such as `<img src/onerror=alert('XSS-msg-subject')>`
5. In the message body field enter a tag such as `<img src/onerror=alert('XSS-msg-body')>`
6. Click the Send button
7. If the message recipient is logged into LogicalDOC in the Chrome web browser a pop-up will appear notifying the user of the new message and the XSS will execute in their web browser. If the user was not logged in at the time the message was sent, or they are using the Firefox web browser the XSS will execute in their web browser when they navigate to the messages panel if the XSS was placed in the subject field. If the XSS was placed in the message body it will execute when they select the message.

Note that the "Guest" group is able to send messages to other users by default, including administrators. This would be the likely attack path for an otherwise untrusted, but technically authenticated, user.

### CVE-2022-47416 Exploitation

CVE-2022-47416 is a stored XSS in the in-app chat system, and was observed in the Enterprise edition of the DMS. Reproduction steps are detailed below.

1. Click Dashboard tab
2. Click Chat tab
3. In the message input box at the bottom of the bag enter a tag such as `<img src/onerror=alert('XSS-chat-msg')>`
4. Click the Post button
5. The XSS will execute in a user's web browser if the user is logged into LogicalDoc with the Chat tab selected. If the user was not logged in at the time the message was sent, the XSS will execute in their web browser when they navigate to the Chat tab.

Note that the "Guest" group is able to initiate chats to other users by default, including administrators. This would be the likely attack path for an otherwise untrusted, but technically authenticated, user.

### CVE-2022-47417 Exploitation

CVE-2022-47417 is a stored XSS in the document file name, but the filename must be changed in-app (rather than being merely provided by the attacker through some other mechanism). Reproduction steps are detailed below.

1. Click Documents tab
2. Click Add documents button
3. Select a PDF document to upload, check the “Immediate indexing” checkbox, click the Send button and then click the Save button
4. Select the uploaded document in the upper panel
5. In the lower panel locate the “File name” field and enter as tag such as `<img src/onerror=alert('XSS-filename')>.pdf`
6. Click the Save button
7. A dialog box will appear asking “The file extension has been changed. Do you want to proceed?”, click the Yes button

Once the file name is changed to include the malicious XSS payload, there are a number of conditions that trigger the XSS.

1. The XSS will execute in a user’s web browser when they navigate to the Documents tab.
2. The stored XSS will execute in another user’s web browser, such as the administrator, without them performing any actions as long as that user previously clicked the Documents tab before the adversarial user performed steps 1-7. The user does not need to remain on the Documents tab for the zero-click XSS to execute in their browser.
3. The stored XSS in the document file name will also execute via a search

   a. Either using the search box in the upper right hand corner or the Search tab, enter a unique term that appears within the previously uploaded document and click the magnifying glass icon (search button).

   b. The XSS will execute in a user’s web browser as long as the document was included in the displayed search results.

### CVE-2022-47418 Exploitation

CVE-2022-47418 is an XSS in document version comments. Reproduction steps are detailed below.

1. Click Documents tab
2. Click Add documents button
3. Select a document and click the Send button
4. In the input box for the “Version comment” at the bottom of the dialog box enter a value such as `<img src/onerror=alert('XSS-version-comment')>` and click the Save button.
5. The stored XSS will execute in any user’s web browser if they select the document in the document panel and then click on either the Versions or History tabs.

### Impact

Once a suitable victim has triggered one of the described XSS conditions, the attacker has several avenues for furthering their control over the target organization. A typical attack pattern would be to steal the session cookie a locally-logged in administrator is authenticated with, and reuse that session cookie to impersonate that user to create a new privileged account.

A slightly more subtle and extensible attack would be to hook the victim's browser session and inject the attacker's own commands under the identity of the hooked user, using [BeEF](https://beefproject.com/) or similar post-exploitation tooling.

Once enabled, the attacker would then have access to the stored documents, which may be critically important to the targeted organization.

### Remediation

In the absence of an update from the vendor, administrators should limit the creation of anonymous, untrusted users for the affected DMS, since in many cases, the "Guest" access level is capable of launching these stored XSS attacks against more privileged users. Until a patch or updated is provided by the vendor, only known, trusted users of the DMS should be permitted to use the messaging, chat, document rename, and document version features of the application.

Given the high severity of a stored XSS vulnerability in a document management system, especially one that is often part of automated workflows, administrators are urged to apply any vendor-supplied updates on an emergency basis.

### Disclosure Timeline

* October-November: Research project on DMS vulnerabilities initiated by Matthew Kienow
* Thu, Dec 1, 2022: Initial notification to the vendor via guessed email addresses and support channels. Ticket #11105 opened automatically.
* Fri, Dec 16, 2022: Details disclosed to CERT/CC via [VINCE](https://www.kb.cert.org/vince/) (VRF#22-12-ZMXZP)

* Tue, Feb 7, 2023: Public disclosure

## CVE-2022-47419: Mayan EDMS Tag XSS

An XSS vulnerability was discovered in the Mayan EDMS DMS. Successful XSS exploitation was observed in the in-product tagging system.

### Product Description

Mayan EDMS Workspace is an Apache licensed DMS, available as an on-prem or cloud-hosted collaboration platform. Read more about Mayan EDMS at [the vendor's website](https://www.mayan-edms.com/).

This vulnerability was identified in testing against Mayan EDMS Version 4.3.3 (Build number: v4.3.3\_Tue Nov 15 18:12:36 2022 -0500). It is likely the vulnerability exists in previous versions of the software. Installed using the Docker image and the installation instructions.

### CVE-2022-47419 Exploitation

CVE-2022-47419 is a stored XSS in the in-product tagging system. Reproduction steps are below.

1. Click Tags and then the “Create new tag” link in the panel on the left. This will take you to the URL <http://hostname/#/tags/tags/create/>.
2. In the Label field enter a tag such as `<script>alert('XSS-tag-label')</script>`
3. Click the Save button
4. Select Documents and then the “All documents” link in the panel on the left.
5. Click a document to open the document preview
6. Click the Tags link on the panel to the right.
7. Click the “Attach tags” button
8. Click in the Tags drop-down menu and the XSS will execute in the user’s web browser.

### Impact

Once a suitable victim has triggered the described XSS condition, the attacker has several avenues for furthering their control over the target organization. A typical attack pattern would be to steal the session cookie a locally-logged in administrator is authenticated with, and reuse that session cookie to impersonate that user to create a new privileged account.

A slightly more subtle and extensible attack would be to hook the victim's browser session and inject the attacker's own commands under the identity of the hooked user, using [BeEF](https://beefproject.com/) or similar post-exploitation tooling.

Once enabled, the attacker would then have access to all stored documents, which may be critically important to the targeted organization.

### Remediation

In the absence of an update from the vendor, administrators should limit the creation of anonymous, untrusted users for the affected DMS, since all users have access to the tagging system by default. Until a patch or updated is provided by the vendor, only known, trusted users of the DMS should be permitted to use the tagging features of the application.

Given the high severity of a stored XSS vulnerability in a document management system, especially one that is often part of automated workflows, administrators are urged to apply any vendor-supplied updates on an emergency basis.
