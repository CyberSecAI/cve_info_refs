Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-47419:

**CVE-2022-47419: Mayan EDMS Tag XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of tag labels when generating the Select2 user interface widget template in Mayan EDMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the tag label.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) in the in-product tagging system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking by stealing session cookies. However, the advisory notes that the session cookie has the `httponly` attribute set, mitigating cookie theft.
    *   Account compromise by impersonating a user.
    *   Access to all stored documents in the DMS.
    *   Further attacks, potentially using tools like BeEF, by hooking the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  An attacker with access to the DMS creates a new tag.
    2.  The attacker adds a malicious script in the "Label" field during tag creation.
    3.  When a user attempts to attach tags to a document, the injected script executes in the user's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a valid account within the Mayan EDMS. Note that the advisory states that the attack requires a privileged account, and is not possible to enable from a guest or anonymous account.
    *   The attacker must be able to access and create tags within the application.
    *   The attacker does not need a direct interaction with the victim. The exploit triggers when the victim user interacts with the tag.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Rapid7 researcher Matthew Kienow.
*   The vulnerability was identified in Mayan EDMS version 4.3.3.
*   Mayan EDMS has released a patch in version 4.3.6.
*   The advisory mentions that this is a limited scope weakness of the tagging system markup.
*   The advisory also states that there are no known actual or theoretical attacks exploiting this weakness to expose or destroy data.
