- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing Slips plugin (versions <= 3.2.5) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to execute unwanted actions under the context of a higher privileged user's authentication. The specific impact will vary based on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via CSRF, where an attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a logged-in user into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into interacting with a malicious crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
