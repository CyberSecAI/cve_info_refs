{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper clientside input checks",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Password policy is only enforced on the client-side, allowing an attacker to bypass the length restrictions by crafting a malicious request.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can set a weak password (e.g., a single character) or no password at all, making the device vulnerable to unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "By intercepting and modifying the password change request to include a password that does not adhere to the client-side password policy (e.g. length < 5 or > 32), then sending the crafted request to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify web requests. A user with access to the device's web interface is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
