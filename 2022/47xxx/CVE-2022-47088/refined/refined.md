The provided content discusses a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `gf_vvc_read_pps_bs_internal` function within the `media_tools/av_parsers.c` file of the GPAC project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the `pps->tile_cols_width_ctb` array. The code iterates based on `nb_ctb_left` and increments `pps->num_tile_cols` without checking for array bounds. When `pps->num_tile_cols` reaches 30, an overflow occurs when writing to `pps->tile_cols_width_ctb` which is an array of size 30.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in `pps->tile_cols_width_ctb` array due to missing boundary checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE). The provided crash report from the sanitizer indicates a write out-of-bounds error which confirms a crash due to the buffer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted MP4 file that contains a specific bitstream leading to the condition where `pps->num_tile_cols` exceeds array bounds during the parsing of the Picture Parameter Set (PPS).
- The attacker can provide a malicious MP4 file that triggers the overflow via the command:  `./MP4Box import -add poc_bof3.mp4`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable application. No specific access privileges are mentioned, the vulnerability would be present regardless of the user role.
