Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2022-47875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue within the `/be/erpc.php` component of Jedox Cloud and Jedox 2020.2.5.
*   The application attempts to load program classes from the `rtn` directory. The class name provided by the user is not properly validated against a regex.
*   The path to the class to be loaded is composed with a non-validated variable, allowing the loading of arbitrary PHP files from the file system using relative paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application allows the use of relative paths to load PHP files from the file system, bypassing intended directory restrictions.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The regex used to validate the class name does not prevent the inclusion of directory traversal sequences like `../`.
*   **Unrestricted File Loading:** The application attempts to load classes based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **RPC Functionality Issues:** The presence of RPC functionality in `/be/erpc.php` where arbitrary methods of loaded classes can be executed without authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file to the server via other upload functions and then execute this file by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network through the `/be/erpc.php` endpoint.
*   **File Upload:** The attack requires the attacker to first upload a malicious PHP file via an existing file upload functionality.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The attacker manipulates the class name parameter in the `/be/erpc.php` request to include directory traversal sequences, allowing them to navigate outside the intended class directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to upload files.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the existence and location of the vulnerable endpoint `/be/erpc.php`.
*   **File Upload Ability:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files using an existing function to place the malicious code.
