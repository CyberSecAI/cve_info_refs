3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Control runtime system enables embedded or PC-based devices to be a programmable
industrial controller. Such products contain communication servers for the CODESYS protocol to enable
communication with clients like the CODESYS Development System. These servers have the following

vulnerabilities:

CVE-2022-47378: CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
After successful authentication, specific crafted communication requests with inconsistent content can cause the
CmpFiletransfer component to read internally from an invalid address, potentially leading to a denial-of-service
condition.

CVE-2022-47379: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
After successful authentication, specific crafted communication requests can cause the CmpApp component to
write attacker-controlled data to memory, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition, memory overwriting, or
remote code execution.

CVE-2022-47380, CVE-2022-47381: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
After successful authentication, specific crafted communication requests can cause the CmpApp component to
write attacker-controlled data to stack, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition, memory overwriting, or
remote code execution.

CVE-2022-47382, CVE-2022-47383, CVE-2022-47384, CVE-2022-47386, CVE-2022-47387, CVE-2022-47388,
CVE-2022-47389, CVE-2022-47390: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
After successful authentication, specific crafted communication requests can cause the CmpTraceMgr
component to write attacker-controlled data to stack, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition, memory
overwriting, or remote code execution.

CVE-2022-47385: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
After successful authentication, specific crafted communication requests can cause the CmpAppForce
component to write attacker-controlled data to stack, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition, memory
overwriting, or remote code execution.

CVE-2022-47392: CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
After successful authentication, specific crafted communication requests with inconsistent content can cause the
CmpApp/CmpAppBP/CmpAppForce components to read internally from an invalid address, potentially leading
to a denial-of-service condition.

CVE-2022-47393 : CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
After successful authentication, specific crafted communication requests can cause the CmpFiletransfer
component to dereference addresses provided by the request for internal read access, which can lead to a
denial-of-service situation.

3.2  Exploitability

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities in CODESYS products.

Advisory 2023-02

4  Available software updates

CODESYS GmbH has released version V3.5.19.0, which solves the identified security vulnerabilities for the
following products:
• CODESYS Control RTE (SL)
• CODESYS Control RTE (for Beckhoff CX) SL
• CODESYS Control Win (SL)
• CODESYS Control Runtime System Toolkit
• CODESYS Safety SIL2 Runtime Toolkit
• CODESYS Safety SIL2 PSP
• CODESYS HMI (SL)
• CODESYS Development System V3

For the below listed products, CODESYS GmbH has released version V4.8.0.0 based on the CODESYS
Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit V3.5.19.0:
• CODESYS Control for BeagleBone SL
• CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6 SL
• CODESYS Control for IOT2000 SL
• CODESYS Control for Linux SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC100 SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC200 SL

• CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL
• CODESYS Control for WAGO Touch Panels 600 SL

The CODESYS Development System and the products available as CODESYS AddOns can be downloaded
and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer or be downloaded from the CODESYS Store.

Alternatively, as well as for all other products, you will find further information on obtaining the software update
in the CODESYS Update area [3].

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerabilities.

To exploit these vulnerabilities, a successful login to the affected product is required. The online user
management of the affected products therefore protects from exploiting these security vulnerabilities, even in
the case that the software update is not applied.

CODESYS GmbH strongly recommends using the online user management. This not only prevents an attacker
from sending malicious requests or downloading virulent code, but also suppresses starting, stopping,
debugging or other actions on a known working application that could potentially disrupt a machine or system.
As of version V3.5.17.0, the online user management is enforced by default.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
