Figure 1 – Yeastar N824

## Technical summary

**Swascan Offensive Security Team** found an important vulnerability on: Yeastar  N412 and N824 Configuration Panel.

| **Vulnerability** | **CVSSv3.1** | **Attack Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account Takeover via restoring altered backup file | 9.8 Critical | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |

In the following section the technical details about this vulnerability, including evidence and a proof-of-concept. This vulnerability can affect hundreds of Internet-connected devices.

## Description

In Yeastar  N412 and N824 Configuration Panel, an unauthenticated attacker can create backup file and download it, revealing admin hash, allowing, once cracked, to login inside the Configuration Panel, otherwise, replacing the hash in the archive and restoring it on the device.

It is possible to launch the attack remotely without any form of authentication.

## Proof of Concept

To achieve the account takeover those steps are performed:

1. Unauthenticated backup file creation
2. Download the .tar file created
3. Crack admin hash inside the archive an then log into the device, or modify the .tar archive replacing admin hash
4. If it was not possible to crack the hash, then we need to upload the new altered backup file
5. Restore the backup file uploaded
6. Reboot the device if needed

Following details on exploitation steps:

1. Requesting creation of backup file with a given name.

Figure 3 – Creation backup file response

2. Download the backup file just created.

Figure 5 – Response with the backup file attached

3. Inside the previous response we found the admin hash. Once gained the admin hash we can try to crack it, otherwise, we can modify the archive and upload it to the device.

Figure 7 – Uploading modified previously backed up file

4. Then we restore the uploaded configuration backup file.

Figure 8 – Restoring backup

5. If needed, we can trigger a reboot to reload the configuration with the new password.

Figure 9 –  Triggering Reboot to reload configuration

## Impact

An attacker could obtain access to the remote system, and furthermore enable the ssh console which has a default root password when activated and execute arbitrary commands on the Linux-based system as root user.

## Mitigation

The **Swascan Offensive Security Team** suggests to do not deploy the device directly on the internet, instead set up the device behind a VPN connection.
