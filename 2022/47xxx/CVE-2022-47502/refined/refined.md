Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-47502:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Apache OpenOffice handles links within documents that call internal macros. Specific URI schemes designed for this purpose can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient User Approval:** Certain links that trigger internal macros are not subject to user approval. This lack of verification allows for the execution of arbitrary scripts without explicit consent.
- **Arbitrary Argument Passing:** Links can call internal macros with arbitrary arguments, increasing the potential for malicious actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary scripts on the victim's system without user consent by crafting a malicious document containing a specific link.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Documents:** Attackers create and distribute malicious OpenOffice documents containing specially crafted links that, when activated, trigger the vulnerability.
- **Activation Methods:** These links can be activated either by:
    - Clicks by the user.
    - Automatic document events (when the document is opened).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Document Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a document that exploits the vulnerable link handling mechanism in Apache OpenOffice.
- **Social Engineering/Distribution:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious document to a victim, likely through social engineering or similar means to entice a user to open the document.
- No special position is needed, only the ability to get the user to open the document.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "corner case" of CVE-2022-47502.
- The vulnerability was patched in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.14.
- A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.
- The vulnerability is considered "Critical"

It is worth noting that a later CVE, CVE-2023-47804, is described as a corner case of CVE-2022-47502.
CVE-2023-47804 was initially reported as affecting versions up to 4.1.15 but was later corrected to only affect versions up to 4.1.14.
