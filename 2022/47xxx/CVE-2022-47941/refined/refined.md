{
  "CVE-2022-47941": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The allocated memory `conn->preauth_info` is not freed when errors occur during the SMB2 negotiation process in the `smb2_handle_negotiate()` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by repeatedly triggering the error condition and consuming memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send malformed `SMB2_NEGOTIATE` commands to the ksmbd server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to send SMB2 commands to the vulnerable system."
