- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure default variable initialization. Default installations of Ghost CMS allow non-administrator users to inject arbitrary JavaScript in posts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the `codeinjection_foot` field of a post.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation to administrator via XSS. By injecting malicious Javascript, an attacker can trick an administrator into visiting the post, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the administrator's browser session, which allows the attacker to perform privileged API calls and modify user groups, add users, etc.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an HTTP request to create or modify a post and inject Javascript into the `codeinjection_foot` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to create or edit posts (e.g., Contributor, Author).
    - The attacker needs to trick an administrator into visiting a post containing the injected JavaScript.
