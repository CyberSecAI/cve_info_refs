Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-47878:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation for the `default-storage-path` setting within the Jedox application settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Input Validation:** The application allows users to set the `default-storage-path` to arbitrary locations on the file system, including the web root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By setting the `default-storage-path` to a web-accessible directory, an attacker can upload and execute malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) on the server, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Jedox application.
- The attacker needs to access the application settings page.
- The attacker sets the `default-storage-path` to a web root directory
- The attacker uses the file upload or import function to upload malicious files.
- The attacker executes the uploaded malicious file via a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid user credentials for the Jedox application.
- The attacker must have the permissions to modify application settings and upload/import files.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to change the `default-storage-path`.
- The application will then save files in the directory specified by this setting.
- By setting the path to a web root directory such as `/htdocs/app/docroot/be/`, an attacker can then upload and execute a malicious file by browsing to the location of the uploaded file.
