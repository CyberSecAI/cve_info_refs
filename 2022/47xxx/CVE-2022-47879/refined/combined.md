Our Disclosure Policy

Syslifters is committed to responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities to product
vendors and the general public. We believe that responsible disclosure is a shared
responsibility between vendors and researchers alike and the best way to ensure
security for users. By adhering to this policy, we maintain transparency and can work
together to make the internet a safer place for everyone.

To ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner, we adhere to a 90-day
disclosure deadline and reserve the right to directly notify affected clients. We
immediately notify vendors of vulnerabilities through any appropriate contacts or
formal mechanisms listed on the vendor's website, with details shared with the public
after 90 days, or sooner if a fix is released by the vendor.

This policy is subject to the following exceptions:

•

•

•

If a vendor informs us that a patch is scheduled for release within 14 days following
the deadline, we will delay the public disclosure until the availability of the patch.
In cases of zero-day vulnerabilities (vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited),
we believe that more urgent action is necessary, and we will disclose the
vulnerability within 7 days. This is because each day that a vulnerability remains
undisclosed and unpatched, more devices or accounts are at risk of being
compromised.
We reserve the right to adjust the 90-day disclosure deadline in accordance with
circumstances deemed reasonable by the vendor. We remain committed to treating
all vendors equally and expect the same standard to be applied to us.

Here is the report. What now?

Our initial contact with your security staff was on 20 December 2022. Following our
responsible disclosure policy, we plan to publicly release the vulnerability information in
mid-April. We may adjust the disclosure deadline in accordance with circumstances
deemed reasonable.

We have requested corresponding CVE numbers for you and have already pre-filled
details on the vulnerabilities. CVE records can be updated at any time via CVE.org.

For support, we are of course also available for a personal exchange. If you have any
further questions you can contact us at any time via the corresponding contact options.

CVE-2022-47875: Remote Code Execution via
Directory Traversal

Criticality: Critical
CVSS-Score: 9.9
Vulnerability Type: Directory Traversal
Product:

•

Jedox Cloud
Jedox 2020.2.5

Affects: Component: /be/erpc.php

Overview

A Directory Traversal vulnerability in /be/erpc.php in Jedox Cloud and Jedox 2020.2.5
allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code. To exploit the vulnerability,
the attacker must have the permissions to upload files.

Description

We were able to identify an RPC functionality  erpc.php  on the affected web server.
Using this function, arbitrary methods of already loaded program classes can be
executed. This already poses a significant security risk, since many methods do not
perform any authorization checks for potentially dangerous functions (see also
CVE-2022-47879).

If a program class is not loaded, the application tries to load the class from the directory
rtn :

Figure 2 - Excerpt from the program code of the file erpc.php, licensed under GPL 2,
Copyright (C) 2006-2010 Jedox AG

As can be seen in the excerpt from the program code (from an older Open Source
version suffering from the same issues) under point 1, the name of the class is validated
against a regex, which is does not validate the user supplied value properly. The only
requirement for the entered value is the presence of a letter, number or underscore in
any position.

5 / 31

syslifters.com | Dedicated to Pentests.
Syslifters GmbH | Eitzersthal 75 | 2013 Göllersdorf
FN 578505 v | District Court Hollabrunn

Point 2 marks the path of the class to be loaded which is composed with the non-
validated variable  class .

Therefore, it is possible to load arbitrary PHP files from the file system using a relative
path such as  ../../../storage/h1-Public+Files/n42-pentest .

An attacker can now abuse this vulnerability by first uploading a file using one of the
existing file upload functions, as shown in the following screenshot:

Figure 3 - Upload a file

When uploading a file, the web application returns the location on the file system of the
uploaded file:

Figure 4 - Response to uploading a file

It is now possible to exploit the vulnerability and execute the malicious file:

Figure 5 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)

The preceding screenshot shows that the uploaded file has been executed. For demo
purposes, the malicious payload will only make the server wait for 10-second before it
responds.

CVE-2022-47879: Code Execution via RPC Interfaces

Criticality: Critical
CVSS-Score: 9.9
Vulnerability Type: Exec Code
Product:

•
•

Jedox Cloud
Jedox 2020.2.5

Affects:

•
•

Component: /be/rpc.php
Component: /be/erpc.php

Overview

A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in /be/rpc.php and /be/erpc.php in Jedox
Cloud and Jedox 2020.2.5 allows remote authenticated users to load arbitrary PHP
classes from the rtn directory and to execute its methods. To exploit this vulnerability,
the attacker needs knowledge about loadable classes, their methods and arguments.

Description

Many functions accessible via multiple RPC interfaces were identified that disclose
sensitive data or lead to vulnerabilities. All specified functions can also be executed with
read-only user permissions.

The  Studio::getUserCreds  function can be used to read the clear text credentials of the
currently authenticated user. This is especially critical in combination with the existing
Stored XSS vulnerability (see CVE-2022-47877), as this allows an anonymous (auto-
login) user to steal an administrator's password in clear text:

Syslifters GmbH | Eitzersthal 75 | 2013 Göllersdorf
FN 578505 v | District Court Hollabrunn

Figure 6 -  Studio::getUserCreds

Using function  conn::test_palo , an outgoing HTTP connection can be initiated from the
web server with the authenticated user's credentials. This could leak cleartext
credentials to an attacker:

Figure 7 -  conn::test_palo

As shown in the following screenshot, the server accesses the address via HTTP and
transmits the username and password of the logged-in user.

Syslifters GmbH | Eitzersthal 75 | 2013 Göllersdorf
FN 578505 v | District Court Hollabrunn

Figure 8 - Capturing cleartext credentials

This method is very suitable for an attack using a XSS vulnerability. The password does
not have to be exfiltrated by bypassing cross-origin protection mechanisms, but is sent
from the server to the attacker's system.

The function  Studio::getExternalUrl  can be used to generate a URL with embedded
username and password.

Figure 9 -  Studio->getExternalUrl

A list of all database connections can be retrieved via  conn::ls :

CVE-2022-47878: Remote Code Execution via
Configurable Storage Path

Criticality: Critical
CVSS-Score: 9.1
Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Input Validation
Product: Jedox 2020.2.5
Affects: Setting: default-storage-path

Overview

Incorrect input validation for the default-storage-path in the settings page in Jedox
2020.2.5 allows remote, authenticated users to specify the location as web root
directory. Consecutive file uploads can lead to the execution of arbitrary code. To exploit
the vulnerability, the attacker sets the default storage path to the web root.

Description

In the application settings the default storage path can be set to any value.

Figure 19 - Default storage path setting

An attacker can now set this path to, for example, a directory on the web server such as
/htdocs/app/docroot/be/ .

Then, the upload/import function can be used to upload a malicious .php file to a new
root directory.
