  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2022-47879",
    "description": "A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in /be/rpc.php and /be/erpc.php in Jedox Cloud and Jedox 2020.2.5 allows remote authenticated users to load arbitrary PHP classes from the rtn directory and to execute its methods. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs knowledge about loadable classes, their methods and arguments.",
    "root_cause": "Multiple RPC interfaces lack proper authorization checks, allowing execution of sensitive functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure RPC interfaces",
      "Lack of authorization checks for sensitive functions"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, sensitive data disclosure, including clear text credentials, and the ability to leak credentials to an attacker.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Abuse of multiple RPC interfaces (/be/rpc.php and /be/erpc.php) to execute arbitrary methods of loaded program classes.",
      "Exploitation of specific functions (e.g., Studio::getUserCreds, conn::test_palo, Studio::getExternalUrl, conn::ls, com.jedox.etl.mngr.Connection::getGlobalConnection, common::decrypt, common::paloGet, palo_mgmt::sess_list, palo_mgmt::lic_users_list) through the vulnerable RPC interfaces.",
      "Using the disclosed cleartext credentials and session information to further compromise the system"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be an authenticated user. Requires knowledge of loadable classes, their methods and arguments."
