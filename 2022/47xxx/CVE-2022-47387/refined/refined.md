The provided content is related to CVE-2022-47387.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow in the CmpTraceMgr component of CODESYS Control V3 runtime systems. This occurs due to improper handling of specific crafted communication requests after successful authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow. The CmpTraceMgr component writes attacker-controlled data to the stack without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service: The vulnerability can cause the system to crash or become unresponsive.
- Memory overwriting: Attackers can overwrite portions of the stack, potentially leading to control-flow hijacking.
- Remote code execution: By carefully crafting the overflow, attackers can inject and execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending crafted communication requests to the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.
- The attacker must be able to successfully authenticate with the CODESYS Control V3 runtime system before exploiting the vulnerability. This implies that the attacker needs to have valid credentials.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of CODESYS V3 products prior to V3.5.19.0 when using the CmpTraceMgr component.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8, with a vector string of (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The advisory mentions that the exploitation of this vulnerability requires a successful login to the affected product, highlighting the importance of user management features as a mitigation.
- No public exploits are known.
