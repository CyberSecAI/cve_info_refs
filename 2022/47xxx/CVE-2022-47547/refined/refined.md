    "summary": "This paper presents a formal analysis of the GossipSub protocol, identifying vulnerabilities related to its score function and its configuration. The paper demonstrates how the score function, intended to mitigate attacks by misbehaving peers, can be configured in ways that allow peers to misbehave without penalty, particularly in the context of Eth2.0. This contradicts the intended functionality of the protocol, where misbehaving nodes should be penalized with negative scores and eventually pruned from the network. The authors used the ACL2s theorem prover to model the GossipSub protocol and discovered concrete configurations that lead to the identified vulnerabilities.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the flexibility of the GossipSub score function and its configuration parameters. This flexibility allows for configurations where: 1) negative scores in one topic can be offset by positive scores in other topics, leading to an overall positive score despite misbehavior in specific topics. 2) score caps can prevent detection of misbehavior above certain score contributions, 3)  weights can be set in a way that effectively ignores negative behaviors.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The score function can be manipulated through configuration to allow misbehaving peers to maintain positive scores.",
        "The TopicCap mechanism can cause misbehavior to go unnoticed if total score contribution surpasses the cap.",
        "Lack of clear guidance on how to configure various parameters of the score function, and the ability to specify incorrect or out-of-spec values",
        "The inability of the score function to always identify and penalize bad behavior, such as throttling or not forwarding messages in specific topics, leading to a violation of a fundamental requirement of the defense mechanism.",
        "The use of a score function that is not monotonic, where increasing bad-performance counters (deficit in mesh message deliveries, invalid message deliveries, and behavioral penalties) does not always lead to a decrease in overall score."
      ],
      "impact": "The exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows attackers to misbehave by dropping or delaying data forwarding, sending invalid messages, or throttling message dissemination in specific topics without being detected or pruned from the network. This can lead to:\n\n*   **Throttling/Blocking:** Attackers can limit or block communication in targeted topics, disrupting network functionality without their scores being negatively impacted.\n*   **Eclipse Attacks:** Attackers can surround a victim node and effectively isolate it by blocking or throttling specific topics.\n*   **Partition Attacks:** Attackers can cause network partitions where communication in specific topics is blocked between certain groups of peers.\n\nThese attacks compromise the fundamental property of the defense mechanisms, undermining the protocol's resilience to misbehaving peers.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Configuration manipulation: setting parameters to prevent negative scoring of misbehaving peers",
        "Topic-specific attacks: exploiting the topic-based score calculation to hide misbehavior by performing well in other topics",
        "Message manipulation: throttling, dropping, or delaying messages to lower the score of other peers, while maintaining a positive score themselves"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a peer within the GossipSub network. They also need to be able to perform the actions described in the attack vectors. For example, they need to be able to throttle or block messages and send valid or invalid messages. They do not need to control a large portion of the network to cause significant disruption, as demonstrated by their ability to eclipse a single node with a small number of attackers. No additional capabilities are explicitly needed other than those that peers within the GossipSub network have."
