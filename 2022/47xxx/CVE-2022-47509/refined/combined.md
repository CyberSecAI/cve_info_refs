### Workarounds

SolarWinds recommends customers upgrade to SolarWinds Platform version 2023.2 as soon as it becomes available. The expected release is by the end of April 2023. SolarWinds also recommends customers to follow the guidance provided in the [SolarWinds Secure Configuration Guide](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/orionplatform/content/core-secure-configuration.htm). Ensure only authorized users can access the SolarWinds Platform. Special attention should be given to the following points from the documentation:

* Be careful not to expose your SolarWinds Platform website on the public internet. If you must enable outbound internet access from SolarWinds servers, create a strict allow list and block all other traffic. See [SolarWinds Platform Product Features Affected by Internet Access](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Orion-Platform-Product-Features-Affected-by-Internet-Access).
* Disable unnecessary ports, protocols, and services on your host operating system and on applications like SQL Server. For more details, see the [SolarWinds Port Requirements](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/orionplatform/content/core-solarwinds-port-requirements.htm) guide and [Best practices for configuring Windows Defender Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/best-practices-configuring) (© 2023 Microsoft, available at https://docs.microsoft.com, obtained on March 28, 2023.)

## New features and improvements in SolarWinds Platform

[Return to top](#top)

SolarWinds Platform 2023.2 offers the following improvements compared to previous releases of SolarWinds Platform.

* Security improvements for external alert actions. Only users with server admin rights are able to create new external actions. See [Approve alert actions executing a script](../core-approve-execute-alert-action.htm).
* SMTP authentication improvements
* SSH security improvements

### Other improvements

* SolarWinds Platform Agent now supports RHEL 9.0.
* Credential API now supports SAM.
* Options to disable showing contextual help, new release summaries, or notifications on new versions and security updates are added. In Advanced Configuration settings, search for SolarWinds.Guides and clear the options you want to disable. See [Access the Advanced Configuration](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Advanced-Configuration-access-in-Orion-Platform?language=en_US).
* New low-privilege accounts were introduced for reporting: the ReportingClient database user and the Reporting database role. See [SolarWinds Platform Service Accounts](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Manage-Orion-Service-Accounts).

## New customer installation

[Return to top](#top)

For information about installing SolarWinds Platform (self-hosted), see [SolarWinds Installer](https://www.solarwinds.com/documentation/kbloader.aspx?kb=MT88165).

## How to upgrade

Use the [SolarWinds Installer](https://www.solarwinds.com/documentation/kbloader.aspx?kb=MT88165) to upgrade your entire SolarWinds Platform deployment (all SolarWinds Platform products and any scalability engines) to the current versions.

You must be on Orion Platform 2020.2.1 or later to upgrade to SolarWinds Platform 2023.2. If you are on Orion Platform 2020.2 or earlier, first upgrade to 2020.2.6 and then upgrade to 2023.2.

## Before you upgrade from 2020.2.x

* Before upgrading from Orion Platform 2020.2.6 and earlier to SolarWinds Platform 2022.3 or later, make sure the database user you use to connect to your SQL Server has the **db create** privilege. **Without this privilege, the upgrade will not complete.**
* The legacy syslog and traps functionality has been retired and replaced with new functionality called SolarWinds Log Viewer, which can be upgraded to Log Analyzer for additional capabilities. Current rules and history will automatically be migrated to the new logging functionality (SolarWinds Log Viewer or Log Analyzer). The functionality of SolarWinds Log Viewer and Log Analyzer has been improved to more closely match legacy functionality. See [LA 2022.3 release notes](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/la/content/release_notes/la_2022-3_release_notes.htm) for details.

  If you built syslog and trap alerts using custom SQL queries, they will not function after upgrading to 2022.3 or later. SolarWinds recommends you rewrite the alerts using SWQL (`Orion.OLM entities`) or using the alerting functionality built into Log Viewer/Log Analyzer.
* Some upgrade situations from the Orion Platform to the SolarWinds Platform are not supported and the installer will stop the upgrade automatically.
  + If you have a SQL Server older than 2016.
  + If you have an Orion Platform product version 2020.2 or earlier.

| 1338228, 1352449, 1378959, 1381782, 1387496, 1394937, 1416205, 1418575, 1422299, 1435077, 1450495 | Database login fails for Windows accounts after the upgrade |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue**: When you use Windows authentication to connect to the HCO database and the database SQL server, you can find Database: Login failed for user 'DOMAIN\MACHINENAME$' in the Website log. This can cause intermittent user logouts from the SolarWinds Web Console. | |
| **Workaround**: Change the database account. See [Database login failing for Windows account users after upgrading to 2023.1 and above](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Database-login-failing-for-Windows-account-users?language=en_US). | |

| 1315625, 1329526, 1336784, 1352371, 1358723, 1359224, 1361585, 1362623, 1369852, 1372298 | Polling issues caused by the JobEngine being unable to submit a job |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue**: Polling issues caused by the JobEngine being unable to a submit job for some time. In `SolarWinds.JobEngineService_v2023_2.log`, you will find repeated “Unable to add worker process for” warnings. | |
| **Workaround**:   1. On the main polling engine, back up the `<installPath>\SWJobEngineSvc2.exe.config` file. 2. Open the `SWJobEngineSvc2.exe.config` file, search for `<jobSchedulerSettings_Full`, and add the j`obExecutionCount="10000000"` parameter to `jobSchedulerSettings_Full` tag. The tag should start as follows:`<jobSchedulerSettings_Full jobExecutionCount="10000000"` 3. Restart the JobEngine service in SolarWinds Platform Service Manager. 4. Repeat the steps on all polling engines. | |

| 1349101, 1375797 | Custom SQL reports stop working after the upgrade to 2023.2 |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue**: Starting with 2023.2, the default report privileges might not be enough for SQL queries that require reading sensitive data or accessing the SolarWinds Platform database, Flow Storage, Log Analyzer Database, or any other custom database. | |
| **Workarounds**:   * If you have issues with accessing the Flow Storage, the Log Analyzer Database, or any other database, see [Custom SQL reports fail after the upgrade to 2023.2 (Error executing SQL: not able to access the database 'SolarWindsOrionLog', 'FlowStorage', or a custom database](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Custom-SQL-reports-fail-after-the-upgrade-to-2023-2-Error-executing-SQL-not-able-to-access-the-database-SolarWindsOrionLog-FlowStorage-or-a-custom-database?language=en_US). * If your report requires accessing the SolarWindsOrion database, see [Custom SQL reports fail after the upgrade to 2023.2 (Error executing SQL: database 'SolarWindsOrion')](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Custom-SQL-reports-fail-after-the-upgrade-to-2023-2-Error-executing-SQL-database-SolarWindsOrion?language=en_US). | |
