- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The xili-tidy-tags WordPress plugin versions 1.12.03 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the application while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions on the plugin via a crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in user (with appropriate privileges) to initiate the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
