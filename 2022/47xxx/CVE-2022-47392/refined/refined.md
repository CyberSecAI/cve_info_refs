- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of consistency within input data within the CmpApp, CmpAppBP, and CmpAppForce components.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input, leads to an invalid memory read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service due to the components reading from an invalid memory address.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specifically crafted communication requests with inconsistent content over the network to the vulnerable CODESYS Control V3 runtime system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be authenticated to the CODESYS Control V3 runtime system.
