[**CVE-2022-47034.md**](#file-cve-2022-47034-md)

* Product: PlaySMS
* Vendor: [PlaySMS](https://github.com/playsms/playsms)
* Affected Version(s): 1.4.5 and earlier
* CVE ID: CVE-2022-47034
* Description: A type juggling vulnerability in the component /auth/fn.php of PlaySMS
  v1.4.5 and earlier allows attackers to bypass authentication
* Vulnerability Type: [CWE-697](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/697.html)
* Root Cause: The comparison between the md5 hash of the password provided by the user and the md5 stored in the DB is performed through a loose comparison == (instead of ===),
  which mishandles hashes that begin with 0e followed by exclusively numerical characters
* Impact: An attacker is able to bypass the authentication and escalate privilege
