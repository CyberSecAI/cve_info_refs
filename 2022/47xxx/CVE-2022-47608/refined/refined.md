- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Quick Contact Form plugin for WordPress versions 8.0.3.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is due to improper handling of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which allows injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts execute when a guest visits the site, leading to potential compromise and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied input. The exact attack vector via which the plugin is vulnerable is not stated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide input that is not sanitized or validated by the vulnerable plugin. The required privilege for exploitation is stated as "Administrator" which is likely incorrect as XSS attacks are usually done via front-end form injection.
