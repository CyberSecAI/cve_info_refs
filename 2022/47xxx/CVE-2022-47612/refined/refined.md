- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Participants Database WordPress plugin lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will perform an action on their behalf. The user would need to be logged into WordPress and have the required privileges for the action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering the malicious request. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
