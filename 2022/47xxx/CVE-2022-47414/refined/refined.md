Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-47414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of input during web page generation (CWE-79). Specifically, it's a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "note" functionality of OpenKM DMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored/Persistent XSS (Type II).
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a note for a document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "note" field of a document.
- When a user views the document, the injected script executes in their browser.
- This allows the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies of authenticated users, leading to impersonation and privilege escalation.
    - Hook the user's browser session, allowing the attacker to inject further commands under the identity of the hooked user
    - Access the stored documents, which could contain sensitive data

**Attack Vectors:**
- Requires an authenticated user with access to the OpenKM console.
- The attacker must have the ability to create notes for a document.
- The attack is triggered when another user views the document with the malicious note.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the document note creation functionality.
- No special privileges are explicitly mentioned as being required to create notes in OpenKM, however the attacker needs to be logged in.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in OpenKM version 6.3.12.
- The issue was discovered by Rapid7 researcher Matthew Kienow.
- No patch is available for the vulnerability as of the date of publication.
- It does not require the 'Notes' tab to be selected, triggering when the default tab 'Properties' is selected.
