The provided content relates to CVE-2022-47872.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Interface address" field within the "Collect" module of the maccms10 admin panel. Specifically, the application directly uses the provided URL without validation when creating a new custom interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can make the server send arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external resources, potentially leading to information disclosure, internal network scanning, and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to access the admin panel, navigate to Collect --> Custom interface --> Interface address, and insert a malicious URL into the "name" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have authenticated access to the maccms10 admin panel.

The provided content also includes the following information:
- Affected version: V2021.1000.2000
- The specific HTTP request used to trigger the vulnerability, including parameters such as `collect_url` containing the attacker-controlled URL.
