  "CVE-2022-47021": {
    "Description": "A null pointer dereference issue was discovered in functions op_get_data and op_open1 in opusfile.c in xiph opusfile 0.9 thru 0.12 allows attackers to cause denial of service or other unspecified impacts.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing null pointer check after calling `ogg_sync_buffer()` in the `op_get_data()` and `op_open1()` functions within the `opusfile.c` file. If `ogg_sync_buffer()` returns a NULL pointer, it leads to a dereference of the null pointer, which triggers a crash.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "NULL Pointer Dereference"
      ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can cause a crash or other unspecified impacts by triggering the null pointer dereference.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local; an attacker would need to provide a crafted Opus file or manipulate the input to trigger the vulnerable code paths, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to provide crafted input to vulnerable application using libopusfile.",
    "Affected component": "xiph opusfile library versions 0.9 to 0.12.",
    "Fix": "The issue was fixed by adding explicit null checks after calls to `ogg_sync_buffer()` and returning `OP_EFAULT` if a null pointer is encountered.",
    "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-4j99-9c7q-m4qw on GitHub Advisories, and has been addressed in Fedora updates for versions 36 and 37. The upstream fix is available at https://github.com/xiph/opusfile/commit/0a4cd796df5b030cb866f3f4a5e41a4b92caddf5."
