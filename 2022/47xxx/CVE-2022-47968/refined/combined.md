| Hello Team,  Found a reflected XSS in the "Add application" page. It is possible to inject JavaScript code in the "Application name" input.  [step1 xss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114117719/209628506-5836a297-1759-4da9-ba62-aa005fa2d34b.PNG)  [step2 xss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114117719/209630861-711be946-7f1f-421e-8207-48e6e17f9f40.PNG)  Not a big deal I guess but still wanted to warn about it.  Edit: Found in version 2.5.4 |

| Well... a bug could be considered as a flaw or vulnerability in the software or hardware design that can be potentially exploited by the attackers. These security bugs can be used to exploit various vulnerabilities by compromising ‚Äì user authentication, authorization of access rights and privileges, data confidentiality, and data integrity.
