Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-47880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and access control during database connection checks. Specifically, the application allows authenticated users to modify the host part of a database connection and then test the connection without requiring re-authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of database credentials in clear text.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the host address provided by the user when modifying the database connection.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The application does not require re-authentication when modifying the host part of a database connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain access to database credentials (username and password) in cleartext. This would allow an attacker to directly access the database with the stolen credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of Jedox, specifically the settings page.
*   The attacker modifies the host setting of an existing database connection to a server they control.
*   The attacker then uses the built-in connection check function, which transmits the credentials in cleartext to the specified host.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the permission to modify database connection settings.
*   The attacker needs a server under their control to capture the transmitted credentials.
*   The attacker needs to know the location of the connection test functionality within the settings.

**Summary**
CVE-2022-47880 is an information disclosure vulnerability where an authenticated user with the ability to modify database connection settings can configure the host to a malicious server, then by testing the connection the database credentials are sent in cleartext to the attacker controlled server.
