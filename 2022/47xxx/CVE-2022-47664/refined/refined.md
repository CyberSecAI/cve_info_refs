  "CVE-2022-47664": {
    "Description": "Libde265 1.0.9 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in ff_hevc_put_hevc_qpel_pixels_8_sse",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ff_hevc_put_hevc_qpel_pixels_8_sse` function of libde265.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-120"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service, and potentially remote code execution. A heap-based buffer overflow can cause a crash or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted HEVC video file using the vulnerable libde265 library.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to provide a malicious video file to a user or application that utilizes the vulnerable version of libde265. The attacker needs to have a way to make the system process the malicious file.",
    "Additional details": {
      "CVSS": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H",
