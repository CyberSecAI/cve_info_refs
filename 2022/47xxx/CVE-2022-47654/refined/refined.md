The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `gf_hevc_read_sps_bs_internal` function within the `media_tools/av_parsers.c` file of the GPAC project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write due to an unchecked index `sps->rep_format_idx` when accessing the `vps->rep_format_idx` array. Specifically, if `sps->update_rep_format_flag` is false, `sps->rep_format_idx` is assigned a value from `vps->rep_format_idx[layer_id]`, and if the value of `layer_id` is greater than or equal to the size of the `vps->rep_format_idx` array (which is 16) this will lead to an out-of-bounds read and write when accessing `vps->rep_format_idx[layer_id]`. In the provided PoC, the value of `layer_id` is 45 which results in a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Out-of-bounds write:** The code accesses the `vps->rep_format_idx` array using an index derived from the bitstream, without proper bounds checking after reading it from the bitstream.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code doesn't validate the `layer_id` against the size of the `vps->rep_format_idx` array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to achieve remote code execution by overwriting critical data on the stack or heap. This is mentioned in the report but the exact way isn't detailed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious media file:** A specially crafted HEVC bitstream, which causes a larger than permitted `layer_id` can trigger the overflow when processed by GPAC's `MP4Box` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious HEVC video file that has a large `layer_id` in the bitstream.
- The attacker must have the victim process the malicious file using a vulnerable version of GPAC's `MP4Box` tool.

**Additional Information:**
- The report includes a sample `poc_bof8.mov` file that can reproduce the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to be present in GPAC version `2.1-DEV-rev593-g007bf61a0-master`.
- The issue was fixed in commit `88e7b87`.
