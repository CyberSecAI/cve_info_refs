The provided content is related to CVE-2022-47406.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure of the "Change password for frontend users" (fe_change_pwd) TYPO3 extension to revoke existing user sessions after a password change.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Insufficient Session Expiration: The extension does not invalidate existing sessions upon a password change.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
If a user changes their password, their old session remains valid. This could allow an attacker who has hijacked an old session to continue accessing the account, even after a password change. This grants the attacker continued access to the user account.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker who has previously obtained a valid user session (e.g., through session hijacking) can continue to use that session even after the user changes their password. The attack vector is network based, leveraging the existing user session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have previously gained a valid session for the user on the affected system. This could be obtained through session hijacking or similar means. The attacker requires only a low privilege level.
