- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Action Launcher app loads data from its database into memory during initialization. A malicious app can inject a large amount of data into this database. This causes the launcher to get stuck in the initialization phase while trying to load the large amount of data on the UI thread, leading to a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows unauthorized apps to write to its database via a publicly accessible content provider without proper input validation or size limitations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack results in a permanent denial of service where the launcher app becomes unresponsive and fails to display home screens. This is persistent even after device reboot because the malicious data is stored in the database.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application can use the content provider to inject large amounts of data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to install a malicious application on the same Android device as the vulnerable Action Launcher. The malicious app needs to have the capability to interact with the Action Launcher's content provider.
