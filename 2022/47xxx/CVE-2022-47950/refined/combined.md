When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : swift
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-47950
Debian Bug     : 1029200

Sebastien Meriot discovered that the S3 API of Swift, a distributed
virtual object store, was susceptible to information disclosure.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.26.0-10+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your swift packages.

For the detailed security status of swift please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/swift>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# OSSA-2023-001: Arbitrary file access through custom S3 XML entities[Â¶](#ossa-2023-001-arbitrary-file-access-through-custom-s3-xml-entities "Link to this heading")

Date:

January 17, 2023

CVE:

CVE-2022-47950

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Swift: <2.28.1, >=2.29.0 <2.29.2, ==2.30.0

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

SÃ©bastien Meriot (OVH) reported a vulnerability in Swiftâs S3 XML parser. By supplying specially crafted XML files an authenticated user may coerce the S3 API into returning arbitrary file contents from the host server resulting in unauthorized read access to potentially sensitive data; this impacts both s3api deployments (Rocky or later), and swift3 deployments (Queens and earlier, no longer actively developed). Only deployments with S3 compatibility enabled are affected.

### Bug Description

The vulnerability managers received the following report from Sébastien Meriot with OVH via encrypted E-mail:

Few weeks ago, our team managing the Swift clusters discovered a vulnerability affecting the S3 API allowing a remote authenticated adversary

to read arbitrary files on the host filesystem by exploiting an improper use of XMLParser.

We evaluate the CVSS score to 7.7:

<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N>

The issue is located in the file: swift/common/middleware/s3api/etree.py

The way the XMLParser is used allows to resolve entities and then to read file content by adding entities in the uploaded XML.

Here is a quick reproducer using both 'PutBucketACL' and 'DeleteObjects':

```

$ cat xxe

<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname"> ]>

<AccessControlPolicy xmlns="<http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/>">;

<Owner>

                "ID": "demo:demo",

                "Type": "CanonicalUser"

            },

            "Permission": "FULL\_CONTROL"

        }

    ]

}

$ curl -i -XPUT "<http://mybucket.localhost:5000/?acl=&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=demo%3Ademo%2F20221025%2FRegionOne%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221025T151109Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=16b7dd1a10bd87a5e3d3c872714c17898ff13e10ba3c5a5c4f99a2d89e0daf8e>" --upload-file xxe

                "Type": "CanonicalUser"

            },

            "Permission": "WRITE"

        }

    ]

}

```

As you can see, in the DisplayName and the ID field, the content of the hostname file is returned.

The same thing happens with the DeleteObjects endpoint.

We applied a quick patch to fix this issue like follow :

```

diff --git a/swift/common/middleware/s3api/etree.py b/swift/common/middleware/s3api/etree.py

index 987b84a14..e5f824bc9 100644

Can confirm -- seems like a nasty one! Working on getting a test together, but that fix looks appropriate. Hope to have a patch to offer here later tonight, or my Monday at the latest.

If it helps, we've already worked on the fix and the tests.

But we also thought about a way to detect this kind of attack.

Here is the commit attached.

I forgot to add Romain De Joux as co-author of this patch. If you use this patch, is it possible to add him? Thanks

Patch makes sense -- I have a few notes, and a fresh patch:

- The added functional tests assume they are running on the proxy under test -- would it be better to probe for /etc/swift/swift.conf than some temp file?

- Is it expected that 3 of 5 added tests pass without the fix? I think I understand the server-side validation we have that prevent the XXE vulnerability on those APIs, but want to make sure this was intended.

- The added logging may get noisy -- as a general rule, I tend to worry about adding server warnings for bad client behavior. Emitting a new counter metric might be better? I'm content to leave it, though; it's no worse than our client-disconnect behavior.

it looks like `resolve\_entities=False, no\_network=True` is the real fix ... aside from the test, the rest of the diff is just plumbing for the logger

... which seems questionable to me because the logged warning sounds scary but isn't actually and there's nothing ops can do about it.

Let's drop the logging and land the fix so we can life the security embargo - then we can figure out what to do about the logger plumbing.

I think I like splitting it up; first patch to have the fix and tests, second to add logging. Then we can debate the logging separately and (potentially) with more input from others. Clay lost the func tests, though; this patch retains them but drops the logging.

OK I've had a play with the patch. Looks good. I've gone and spit them up into 2 that we can push up one after the other into gerrit. The first is just the fix and tests, as suggested by Clay and the other is the logging stuff.

Persionally I don't mind the logging stuff too much as I can understand it might be nice to know how often these entitities are in requests.. but as the others suggest a warning tells the ops what, there is nothing they can really do about it.

Anycase, holding up a security bug with this seems silly, so if we split them in 2 like this we can land the fix, and discuss the logging and also get that landed a short time afterwards.

So aside from just splitting the patch provided by Tim (as it had the functional test), I've also gone and fixed up pep issues in the first patch that'll probably cause issues in zuul when we do push it.

Having said that, there are some format strings in the patch that will apply fine to py3, but if we plan to backport this into py2 releases then we may need to either modify the patch to be py2/3 compliant \_or\_ just adjust the backported patch accordingly. it's only in the functional test.

I have kept the ownership of both patches the same as the original patch.. but if you don't like my fiddling with your code, Feel free to adjust accordingly.

Thanks for the comments and improvements.

Indeed, some tests pass without the patch. I did a test for all requests that expect XML, to make sure there is no regression.

I totally agree to split the patch into 2, the log message is much less of a priority (+1 on both patches).

Good call on the py2 fixups, Matt, thanks! There was one more f-string in test\_complete\_multipart\_upload I've fixed up.

I think I see the problem, but I'll just update the test to avoid it for now and write up a separate bug.

Matt and/or Clay, want to spot-check the new patch?

Jeremy, am I right to think that you will be the VMT coordinator for this? Do you need any help with the impact description?

It's probably worth noting that this impacts all Swift deployments with an S3-compatibility layer, whether that's provided by s3api (for Swift 2.18.0+; i.e. Rocky and later) or swift3 (for Queens and earlier, but for which development has stopped).

Mitigations are to either patch the software (it boils down to the one-line change identified in the initial report) or disable S3-compatibility.

Yes, I'll serve as the vulnerability coordinator for the CVE request, advance downstream stakeholder notification, advisory publication and so on. Assuming folks are good with the proposed change to master we'll also want clean backports to the current state of at least the stable/zed, stable/yoga and stable/xena branches (though feel free to create patches for older branches too if you like). Ideally attach the results of a git-formatted patch as described here: <https://security.openstack.org/#how-to-propose-and-review-a-security-patch>

In order to request a CVE assignment from MITRE, I'll need a succinct description of the flaw and resulting risks (which we'll also include for context in subsequent communications). Here's an attempt, but please let me know if I got anything wrong...

Title: Arbitrary file access through custom S3 XML entities

Reporter: Sébastien Meriot (OVH)

Products: Swift

Affects: <2.28.1, >=2.29.0 <2.29.2, ==2.30.0

Description:

Sébastien Meriot (OVH) reported a vulnerability in Swift's S3 XML parser.

By supplying specially crafted XML files an authenticated user may coerce the S3 API into returning arbitrary file contents from the host server resulting in unauthorized read access to potentially sensitive data; this impacts both s3api deployments (Rocky or later), and swift3 deployments (Queens and earlier, no longer actively developed).

Only deployments with S3 compatibility enabled are affected.

I'll file a private CVE request with MITRE now that we've got

agreement on the impact description. Once we have clean backports,

we'll pick a publication date and I'll supply advance copies of the

patches to OVH and other downstream stakeholders by E-mail under a

temporary embargo. We require a minimum of 3 business days between

advance notification and publication, though attempt to make it no

more than 5 business days. We generally schedule publication for

15:00 UTC on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, and avoid publishing

on major holidays.

Given the above, I think we should probably expect to send advance

notification on Tuesday, January 3 (assuming we have the backported

patches and CVE assignments by then), with publication at 15:00 UTC

on Tuesday, January 10.

For reference, our vulnerability management process and timeline is

documented here:

  (12.6 KiB,
  text/plain)

Updated the patch to include a reference to the now-assigned CVE.

The one patch applies cleanly to stable/wallaby and later. For earlier branches, it should be fairly easy to cherry-pick; it's simple context differences for stable/train through stable/victoria, and a minor unit test conflict for stable/rocky and stable/stein.

Recently checked on the stable gates, too -- we should be able to merge patches at least as far back as stein without too much difficulty.

Matt, Alistair, Clay, can I get some reviews on the newest patch?

Jeremy, have we sent the advance notice already, or are we waiting on reviews? FWIW, the only feedback I expect would be with regard to testing -- the crux of the issue is the one line change in swift/common/middleware/s3api/etree.py

Sending advance notification to downstream stakeholders can't happen

until we have consensus on the fix(es), individual patches for each

stable branch at least as far back as stable/xena, and agree on a

publication date and time.

It sounds like there is likely consensus on the current state of

your patch, and since you indicate you expect to directly push the

same patch to multiple branches I suppose can just include copies of

the same patch named for each branch in order to avoid confusion.

Assuming this is all accurate, I can send the advance notification

to downstream stakeholders on Tuesday, January 10, with a planned

advisory publication at 15:00 UTC on Tuesday, January 17 (our

maximum of 5 business days, in order to give deployers and

distribution package maintainers ample time to prepare updated

packages).

Does this plan sound reasonable to everyone? If there are no

objections by Tuesday, January 10, I'll proceed under the assumption

that it's fine. Thanks!

Notification tomorrow sounds good to me; I'll see if I can goad other cores to leave a review today, but I've certainly not heard any objections to the patch as it stands.

As scheduled, I'm planning to switch this bug's type to Public Security at 15:00 UTC (approximately an hour from now), at which point someone (ideally Tim) needs to push the patch to at least the master, stable/zed, stable/yoga, and stable/xena branches. Once that happens, so that we have the review URLs for them, I'll push the corresponding advisory text to the openstack/ossa repository and send a copy to the relevant mailing lists.

On closer look at the patch, it was originally authored by Aymeric and subsequently revised by Tim, Clay and Matthew so it would make sense for any of the above to push it to the indicated branches at 15:00 UTC once this bug is switched to public. If none of you are available for that time, I'm happy to do it instead of course.

I pushed an additional cherry-pick to stable/wallaby since we asserted in the pre-OSSA that the patch applies cleanly there. Also, as Tim noted in comment #23, "For earlier branches, it should be fairly easy to cherry-pick; it's simple context differences for stable/train through stable/victoria, and a minor unit test conflict for stable/rocky and stable/stein."

s3api: Prevent XXE injections

Previously, clients could use XML external entities (XXEs) to read

    arbitrary files from proxy-servers and inject the content into the

    request. Since many S3 APIs reflect request content back to the user,

    this could be used to extract any secrets that the swift user could

    read, such as tempauth credentials, keymaster secrets, etc.

Now, disable entity resolution -- any unknown entities will be replaced

    with an empty string. Without resolving the entities, the request is

    still processed.

s3api: Prevent XXE injections

Previously, clients could use XML external entities (XXEs) to read

    arbitrary files from proxy-servers and inject the content into the

    request. Since many S3 APIs reflect request content back to the user,

    this could be used to extract any secrets that the swift user could

    read, such as tempauth credentials, keymaster secrets, etc.

Now, disable entity resolution -- any unknown entities will be replaced

    with an empty string. Without resolving the entities, the request is

    still processed.

Thanks for the merges to stable branches!

I'm wondering if the releases will be updated, and when?

I saw an update for stable/xena[1] but that's not right too.
