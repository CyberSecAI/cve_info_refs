- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `CmpTraceMgr` component of CODESYS Control V3 runtime systems. Specifically, crafted communication requests can cause the component to write attacker-controlled data to the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial-of-service
    - Memory overwriting
    - Remote code execution
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based attacks using specially crafted communication requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated access to the CODESYS Control V3 runtime system is required.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted communication requests.
