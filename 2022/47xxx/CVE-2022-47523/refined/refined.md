- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation and escaping of special characters in user-supplied input leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute custom SQL queries and access database table entries. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability exists in the web application's handling of user requests. A malicious user can inject SQL code through vulnerable input fields or parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application. No further information about attacker capabilities is provided.
