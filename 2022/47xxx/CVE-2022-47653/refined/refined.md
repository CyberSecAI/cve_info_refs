The content is related to CVE-2022-47653.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `eac3_update_channels` function within `media_tools/av_parsers.c`. Specifically, the code accesses `hdr->streams[i]` without properly validating the index `i`, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write. The index is not properly bounds checked before being used to access the `hdr->streams` array, which is defined as `GF_AC3StreamInfo streams[8]`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The code accesses the `hdr->streams` array using an index `i` that can exceed the array's bounds. The `for` loop iterates up to `hdr->nb_streams` and the code does not validate if `hdr->nb_streams` is within array bounds, which leads to an out of bounds write when the value of i exceeds 7 (the highest index that can be accessed by `hdr->streams`)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can cause the application to crash.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** It's mentioned that the vulnerability could potentially lead to RCE, although no specific details are given on how.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted input file (e.g., an SWF file in this case).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious file that causes the vulnerable code to be executed with an invalid stream count. The attacker would need to create a file with an AC3 stream count that exceeds the size of the `streams` array, which is set to 8.
