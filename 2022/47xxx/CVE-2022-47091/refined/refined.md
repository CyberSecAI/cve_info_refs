Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-47091:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `gf_text_process_sub` function within the `filters/load_text.c` file.
- The code iterates through a string (`szLine`) looking for '}' character. Inside the loop the code copies characters from `szLine` to `szTime` without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking when copying data into the `szTime` buffer. The loop condition only checks for the end of the string and the closing brace but doesn't take into account the size of the `szTime` buffer which can lead to writing beyond the allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A buffer overflow can cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, buffer overflows can, in some scenarios, be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the target system, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted text file that is used as input for `MP4Box`.
- The specific input format appears to involve a line containing curly braces, where the characters between the braces are parsed and are copied into the szTime buffer. A crafted text file could include long strings between the braces that exceeds the size of the buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted text input to the vulnerable `MP4Box` application. This could involve getting a user to open a malicious media file, or tricking a server process into parsing malicious data.
- An understanding of the file format being parsed to craft the overflowing text string.

**Additional Notes:**

- The report includes a snippet of code where the overflow occurs, `szTime[i] = szLine[i+1+j]; // overflow at szTime`.
- The issue report includes a reproducer, that utilizes a crafted file named `poc_bof5.avi`, which is provided as a zip.
-  The fix for the issue is mentioned as `[65d089b](/gpac/gpac/commit/65d089bcb5dad6fda668ee61e38a8394ed8bdf1f)`

**Summary of CVE-2022-47091 based on the provided information:**

The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow in the `gf_text_process_sub` function due to inadequate bounds checking when copying data into the `szTime` buffer from input text. This can lead to a denial-of-service and potentially remote code execution. Exploitation requires the attacker to provide a specially crafted text file for processing by the vulnerable application.
