- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Store Locator plugin (versions <= 3.98.7) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication, leading to unauthorized changes or other malicious activities. The specific impact can vary.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), where an attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks an authenticated user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
