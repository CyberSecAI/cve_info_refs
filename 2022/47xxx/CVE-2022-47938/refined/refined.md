  "CVE ID": "CVE-2022-47938",
  "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2_TREE_CONNECT commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.",
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling SMB2_TREE_CONNECT commands, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds Read",
    "Insufficient Input Validation"
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can create a denial-of-service condition on an affected Linux Kernel system.",
  "Attack vector": "The attack vector is remote, through the network, using crafted SMB2_TREE_CONNECT commands.",
  "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability."
