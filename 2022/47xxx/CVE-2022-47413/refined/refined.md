The provided content discusses multiple CVEs related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in various Document Management Systems (DMS).  Specifically, it details CVE-2022-47413 in OpenKM.

**CVE-2022-47413: OpenKM Document XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The OpenKM DMS fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided content, specifically within documents saved to the DMS. This allows malicious code to be stored and executed when a user interacts with the document (direct navigation or through search).
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
    *   This can lead to session hijacking (stealing session cookies), account compromise (creating new privileged accounts), or further attacks using browser hooking techniques with tools like BeEF.
    *   An attacker could gain access to stored documents.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Document upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious document containing an XSS payload. The exploit is triggered when a user views the document.
    *  **Search:** The stored XSS payload in the document will execute when a user performs a search that returns the malicious document.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to upload a document to the DMS and have another user access it via search or direct navigation. This could range from having guest access or convincing a user to upload a malicious document.
    * A basic understanding of XSS techniques.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability is present in OpenKM version 6.3.12.
* The vulnerability is still unpatched.
* A PDF or text file with the payload `One <img src/onerror=alert('XSS-doc-1')> two` can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
* The XSS is triggered in the 'Properties' tab when selecting the document, even if the preview tab is not selected.
