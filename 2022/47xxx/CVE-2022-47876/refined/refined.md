Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-47876:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to create and execute Groovy scripts within the Integrator component of Jedox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Code Execution:** The system allows users to create custom Groovy jobs with arbitrary code.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The system does not properly validate or sanitize the Groovy code, allowing the inclusion of system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the Jedox application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Groovy Script Creation:** The attacker creates a new Groovy job within the Integrator module.
*   **Malicious Script Insertion:** The attacker inserts malicious code, such as system commands, into the Groovy jobâ€™s source code.
*   **Job Execution:** The attacker executes the crafted Groovy job.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials and the necessary permissions to create a Groovy Job within the Integrator module.
*   **Knowledge of Groovy:** The attacker needs to be able to write Groovy code to execute commands on the system.
