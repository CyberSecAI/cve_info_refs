The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-47417.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (CWE-79). Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the LogicalDOC DMS handles and displays document file names.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The filename field in LogicalDOC is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies, allowing impersonation of the victim (including administrators).
    - Injecting attacker-controlled commands under the identity of the victim, potentially using tools like BeEF.
    - Gaining access to stored documents and other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have some level of access to the LogicalDOC system. Guest access is often sufficient.
- The attacker must change the filename through the application.
    - Upload a document
    - Modify the document filename by injecting malicious code
-The XSS can then be triggered under several conditions:
    - Browsing to the document tab
    - By search
    - Zero-click when another user has previously visited the documents tab.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to log into the LogicalDOC DMS. Even 'guest' level accounts are able to trigger this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to upload a document and edit its filename.
