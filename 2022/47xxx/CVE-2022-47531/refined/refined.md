The provided content is a security advisory from Gruppo TIM, detailing vulnerabilities found in various software products. Here's an analysis of the relevant portion concerning CVE-2022-47531:

**CVE-2022-47531 â€“ Ericsson EPG**

*   **Vulnerability Description**: *Improper Privilege Management - CWE-269*
*   **Software Version**: 3.18
*  **NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47531>
*   **CVSSv3**:  **8.8**
*   **Severity**: High
*   **Credits**: Andrea Carlo Maria Dattola, Massimiliano Brolli
*   **Root Cause:** Missing Input Validation. The system CLI does not properly validate input, which allows authenticated users to execute commands they are not authorized to perform directly in the UNIX shell.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269): The system fails to properly restrict the actions a user can perform.
    *   Missing Input Validation: The system CLI does not validate the input received, allowing users to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Limited loss of confidentiality and/or low impact to integrity and availability of the system. An attacker can bypass system CLI restrictions and execute unauthorized commands directly in the UNIX shell which can lead to limited loss of confidentiality, and low impact to integrity and availability of the system
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   An authenticated user must have access to the EPG's CLI interface.
    *   The attacker then injects malicious commands through the system CLI.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the EPG system's CLI.
