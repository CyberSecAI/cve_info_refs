# XSS vs CSRF

In this section, we'll explain the differences between XSS and CSRF, and discuss whether CSRF tokens can help to prevent XSS attacks.

## What is the difference between XSS and CSRF?

[Cross-site scripting](/web-security/cross-site-scripting) (or XSS) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the browser of a victim user.

[Cross-site request forgery](/web-security/csrf) (or CSRF) allows an attacker to induce a victim user to perform actions that they do not intend to.

The consequences of XSS vulnerabilities are generally more serious than for CSRF vulnerabilities:

* CSRF often only applies to a subset of actions that a user is able to perform. Many applications implement CSRF defenses in general but overlook one or two actions that are left exposed. Conversely, a successful XSS exploit can normally induce a user to perform any action that the user is able to perform, regardless of the functionality in which the vulnerability arises.
* CSRF can be described as a "one-way" vulnerability, in that while an attacker can induce the victim to issue an HTTP request, they cannot retrieve the response from that request. Conversely, XSS is "two-way", in that the attacker's injected script can issue arbitrary requests, read the responses, and exfiltrate data to an external domain of the attacker's choosing.

## Can CSRF tokens prevent XSS attacks?

Some XSS attacks can indeed be prevented through effective use of CSRF tokens. Consider a simple reflected XSS vulnerability that can be trivially exploited like this:

`https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>`

Now, suppose that the vulnerable function includes a CSRF token:

`https://insecure-website.com/status?csrf-token=CIwNZNlR4XbisJF39I8yWnWX9wX4WFoz&message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>`

Assuming that the server properly validates the CSRF token, and rejects requests without a valid token, then the token does prevent exploitation of the XSS vulnerability. The clue here is in the name: "cross-site scripting", at least in its [reflected](/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) form, involves a cross-site request. By preventing an attacker from forging a cross-site request, the application prevents trivial exploitation of the XSS vulnerability.

Some important caveats arise here:

* If a reflected XSS vulnerability exists anywhere else on the site within a function that is not protected by a CSRF token, then that XSS can be exploited in the normal way.
* If an exploitable XSS vulnerability exists anywhere on a site, then the vulnerability can be leveraged to make a victim user perform actions even if those actions are themselves protected by CSRF tokens. In this situation, the attacker's script can request the relevant page to obtain a valid CSRF token, and then use the token to perform the protected action.
* CSRF tokens do not protect against stored XSS vulnerabilities. If a page that is protected by a CSRF token is also the output point for a stored XSS vulnerability, then that XSS vulnerability can be exploited in the usual way, and the XSS payload will execute when a user visits the page.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

![](/_next/image?url=%2Fauthors%2Fkirito.png&w=128&q=75)
#### Kirito

### Abstract

When it comes to Web applications, the amount of vulnerabilities that may exist is undeniable. Since OWASP Top Ten 2007, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is amongst the most common flaws, both for it's easy exploitability and for it's significant impact for vulnerable applications.

After 14 years this kind of vulnerability is still evidenced in OWASP Top Ten 2021, composing the A3-Injection category

### How does "Cross-Site Scripting" work?

In programming, a script is a series of instructions that tell a program what to do. In the Web application scenario, once it doesn't validate the information sent to the server, a malicious agent may inject custom scripts that will change the website's behaviour. It is worth mentioning that the browser can't tell between legitimate code and malicious code in this situation.

Thereby, the XSS vulnerability differs from other Web attacks, once it does not target directly the compromised app, but the users that browse to the affected solution. By using Javascript code injection on a Web page, an attacker may overcome the Same-Origin policy, which is designed to separate different websites from each other, besides the possibility of accessing cookies, session tokens and other sensitive information stored by the browser for the Website usage.

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that allows complex items implementation on Web pages, given that a regular Web page would only show static content. When a Web application shows interactive maps, 2D/3D graphs, animations, among other similar resources, JavaScript is surely involved. By using the "cupcake" analogy, it is the third cake layer in the standard Web technologies, of which HTML and CSS compose the first two layers.

* HTML is the markup language used to structure and give meaning to the Web content. By defining paragraphs, headers, content tables, or inserting images and videos on the page.
* CSS is the style rule language used to apply style to the HTML content. By defining background colors and fonts, and positioning the content into multiple columns.
* JavaScript is the programming language that allows creation of dynamically updated content, controlling multimedia, animated images, among other actions.

## XSS vulnerable code example

```
<?php
        $search = $_GET['q'];
        echo "No results were found for " . $search;
?>

```

The image bove is an example of a code snippet that is vulnerable to XSS, once there is no validation of the `*q` parameter receveid through a GET request.\*

****XSS impact****

* Redirect users to malicious websites;
* Capture keystrokes from users;
* Access browser history and clipboard content from users;
* Execute browser-based exploits (for example, crashing the browser);
* Obtain cookie information from users;
* Steal the login session token, allowing the attacker to interact with the application as the victim without having their credentials;
* Force the user to send attacker-controlled requests to a server;
* Change the contents of a webpage;
* Deceive the user for them to disclose their password to the application or other applications;
* Infect the victim with another malicious code by using a browser vulnerability, potentially taking over the victim's device.

## Types of Attack

There are three types of Cross-Site scripting attacks, and despite having similarities amongst each other, their level of scope and danger are quite different. They are:

## **Reflected** **XSS**

Reflected XSS is the most common and simple form of the three XSS types. It is the easiest to execute and the easiest to be detected. It is actually the only type that can be identified.

Also known as **non persistent attack,** it requires that the victim click on malicious links prepared with the attacker's script. The victim's browser sends the payload request to the server and it is "reflected" to the victim through an infected page.

The attacker does not need to to violate the application itself, they just need to convince the victim to click on infected links, which makes this attack a mix of social engineering and luck.

A very common example of this kind of attack is in search fields on websites, where a user inputs some information for the search, which will be displayed on the page. If the application doesn't validate this data correctly, an attacker may add Javascript code to this search field, thus executing this code.

## Stored **XSS**

The Stored XSS overcomes the Reflected XSS limitation, which needs to be actively initiated every time by a malicious link. Stored XSS allows the attacker to inject scripts permanently into the application, thus infecting every user that accesses it. For this reason, it is also known as persistent XSS attack

*Imagine that a contact/comments section of an application does not validate correctly the messages sent by the users. If an attacker inserts malicious code into these comments, this code will be executed by the browser of any users that accesses the page.*

Stored XSS attacks are more complex than the reflected ones, once the attacker needs to identify a website with:

* Enough traffic to make the attack worth;
* A security vulnerability that can be leveraged by stored XSS attacks.

Once the perfect scenario is identified, a cyber criminal will be able to affect a much greater number of victims. Any person that visualizes an infected website will receive the malicious scripts on their browser, and when the script is executed, the characters that compose it are not shown in plain text on the compiled page. For that reason, the **Stored XSS attack is almost impossible to detect.** There are no alert signs that will raise suspicion.

## DOM-Based XSS

The DOM-Based (Document Object Model) consolidates when a malicious agent modifies the interaction between the browser and the websites that the user access, changing the way the victim reacts to the sent data. While reflected and stored XSS attacks affect the HTML on the server side, the DOM-Based attacks ignore that and focus exclusively on the browser activity.

Once the attacker can intercept the process in which client-side Javascript sends its data to the Web application, they can change the way the application works on their browser.

### How to protect yourself (Client)

* Disable scripts on pages where they're not needed or disable them completely;
* Avoid clicking on links from suspicious e-mails or posts in message forums;
* Access websites by directly typing their URL on your browser, instead of clicking third party links;
* Keep the software updated in order to benefit from the latest bug fixes and security patches. Regularly updating the software will significantly reduce the vulnerabilities that make Web applications prone to XSS attacks;
* Audit applications to determine which are needed and which are rarely used;

### How to protect yourself (Server)

Attacks related to the A03:2021-Injection happen due to a non sanitization of information sent to the server, both on the data input from user and on the retrieval of data from the server. There are countless methods to validate the input and output of information. OWASP suggests the usage of libraries that provide the sanitization for HTML code for the languages PHP <http://htmlpurifier.org/>, JavaScript <https://github.com/ecto/bleach> and Python <https://pypi.org/project/bleach/>.

Another methods for prevention:

* Never use [eval()](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval);
* Add security headers againt [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet)
  + `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` Activates protection on the browser;
  + `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` Prevents Javascript code from being inserted on images or elements attributes;
  + `Content-Security-Policy: script-src` The most important one, that avoids basically any potential XSS input;
* Add the *HttpOnly* and *Secure* flags on session cookies.

  ### Raquel L.

  “O Vini é um profissional fora da curva! Inteligente, dedicado, esforçado e muito competente. Iniciamos nossa parceria de trabalho em times diferentes, ele no Red Team, e eu no Blue Team, mas desde àquela época já pude perceber que o Vini era um colega diferenciado. Meses depois, eu assumi a gestão das vulnerabilidades, trabalhando lado a lado ele, e minhas percepções iniciais se confirmaram. Para além das habilidades técnicas, Vini é muito educado, compreensivo e acolhedor, desenvolvemos uma amizade e parceria muito saudáveis. Aprendi muito com esse cara!”](https://br.linkedin.com/in/raquel-lupion?trk=public_profile_recommendations)

# Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

In this section, we'll explain what cross-site request forgery is, describe some examples of common CSRF vulnerabilities, and explain how to prevent CSRF attacks.

## What is CSRF?

Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.

![CSRF](/web-security/images/cross-site%20request%20forgery.svg)
#### Labs

If you're already familiar with the basic concepts behind CSRF vulnerabilities and just want to practice exploiting them on some realistic, deliberately vulnerable targets, you can access all of the labs in this topic from the link below.

* [View all CSRF labs](/web-security/all-labs#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf)
## What is the impact of a CSRF attack?

In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally. For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer. Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role within the application, then the attacker might be able to take full control of all the application's data and functionality.

## How does CSRF work?

For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:

* **A relevant action.** There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).
* **Cookie-based session handling.** Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.
* **No unpredictable request parameters.** The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.

For example, suppose an application contains a function that lets the user change the email address on their account. When a user performs this action, they make an HTTP request like the following:

`POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 30
Cookie: session=yvthwsztyeQkAPzeQ5gHgTvlyxHfsAfE
email=wiener@normal-user.com`

This meets the conditions required for CSRF:

* The action of changing the email address on a user's account is of interest to an attacker. Following this action, the attacker will typically be able to trigger a password reset and take full control of the user's account.
* The application uses a session cookie to identify which user issued the request. There are no other tokens or mechanisms in place to track user sessions.
* The attacker can easily determine the values of the request parameters that are needed to perform the action.

With these conditions in place, the attacker can construct a web page containing the following HTML:

`<html>
<body>
<form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" />
</form>
<script>
document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>`

If a victim user visits the attacker's web page, the following will happen:

* The attacker's page will trigger an HTTP request to the vulnerable website.
* If the user is logged in to the vulnerable website, their browser will automatically include their session cookie in the request (assuming [SameSite cookies](/web-security/csrf#common-defences-against-csrf) are not being used).
* The vulnerable website will process the request in the normal way, treat it as having been made by the victim user, and change their email address.

#### Note

Although CSRF is normally described in relation to cookie-based session handling, it also arises in other contexts where the application automatically adds some user credentials to requests, such as HTTP Basic authentication and certificate-based authentication.

## How to construct a CSRF attack

Manually creating the HTML needed for a CSRF exploit can be cumbersome, particularly where the desired request contains a large number of parameters, or there are other quirks in the request. The easiest way to construct a CSRF exploit is using the [CSRF PoC generator](/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/engagement-tools/generate-csrf-poc) that is built in to Burp Suite Professional:

* Select a request anywhere in Burp Suite Professional that you want to test or exploit.
* From the right-click context menu, select Engagement tools / Generate CSRF PoC.
* Burp Suite will generate some HTML that will trigger the selected request (minus cookies, which will be added automatically by the victim's browser).
* You can tweak various options in the CSRF PoC generator to fine-tune aspects of the attack. You might need to do this in some unusual situations to deal with quirky features of requests.
* Copy the generated HTML into a web page, view it in a browser that is logged in to the vulnerable website, and test whether the intended request is issued successfully and the desired action occurs.

## How to deliver a CSRF exploit

The delivery mechanisms for cross-site request forgery attacks are essentially the same as for reflected XSS. Typically, the attacker will place the malicious HTML onto a website that they control, and then induce victims to visit that website. This might be done by feeding the user a link to the website, via an email or social media message. Or if the attack is placed into a popular website (for example, in a user comment), they might just wait for users to visit the website.

Note that some simple CSRF exploits employ the GET method and can be fully self-contained with a single URL on the vulnerable website. In this situation, the attacker may not need to employ an external site, and can directly feed victims a malicious URL on the vulnerable domain. In the preceding example, if the request to change email address can be performed with the GET method, then a self-contained attack would look like this:

`<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">`

## Common defences against CSRF

Nowadays, successfully finding and exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities often involves bypassing anti-CSRF measures deployed by the target website, the victim's browser, or both. The most common defenses you'll encounter are as follows:

* **CSRF tokens** - A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When attempting to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.
* **SameSite cookies** - SameSite is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. As requests to perform sensitive actions typically require an authenticated session cookie, the appropriate SameSite restrictions may prevent an attacker from triggering these actions cross-site. Since 2021, Chrome enforces `Lax` SameSite restrictions by default. As this is the proposed standard, we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in future.
* **Referer-based validation** - Some applications make use of the HTTP Referer header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. This is generally less effective than CSRF token validation.

For a more detailed description of each of these defenses, as well as how they can potentially be bypassed, check out the following materials. These include interactive labs that let you practice what you've learned on realistic, deliberately vulnerable targets.
