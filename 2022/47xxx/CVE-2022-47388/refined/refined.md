- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `CmpTraceMgr` component. Crafted communication requests can cause the component to write attacker-controlled data to the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition, memory overwriting, or remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specific crafted communication requests over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the affected CODESYS product. The attack can be performed remotely.
