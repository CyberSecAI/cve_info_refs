The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Dynamic Transaction Queuing System v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `id` parameter in the `/queuing/index.php?page=display` URL, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `id` parameter of the `/queuing/index.php?page=display` URL.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization for the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database and retrieve sensitive information. In this case, it is used to retrieve the database name.
- The vulnerability could also be used to modify or delete data.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting malicious SQL queries and injecting them via the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a manipulated `id` parameter.
