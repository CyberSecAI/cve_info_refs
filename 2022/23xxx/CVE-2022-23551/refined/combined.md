> **❗ IMPORTANT**: As mentioned in the [announcement](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2022/01/18/announcing-azure-active-directory-azure-ad-workload-identity-for-kubernetes/), we are planning to replace AAD Pod Identity with [Azure Workload Identity](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity). Going forward, we will no longer add new features to this project in favor of Azure Workload Identity. However, we will continue patching critical bugs and security vulnerabilities until further notice. Refer to [doc](/Azure/aad-pod-identity/blob/v1.8.13/docs/RELEASE.md) for release cadence.

Details about the changes which went into the v1.8.13 release can be found here: <https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/changelog/#v1813>

**Note** The images are now hosted in `mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/aad-pod-identity`

# AAD Pod Identity obtaining token with backslash

Moderate

[aramase](/aramase)
published
GHSA-p82q-rxpm-hjpc
Dec 21, 2022

## Package

AAD Pod Identity

## Affected versions

<v1.8.13

## Patched versions

v1.8.13

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

The [NMI](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/nmi/) component in AAD Pod Identity intercepts and validates token requests based on regex. In this case, a token request made with backslash in the request (example: `/metadata/identity\oauth2\token/`) would bypass the NMI validation and be sent to [IMDS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service?tabs=windows) allowing a pod in the cluster to access identities that it shouldn't have access to.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

* We analyzed this bug and determined that we needed to fix it. This fix has been included in AAD Pod Identity release [v1.8.13](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/releases/tag/v1.8.13)
* If using the [AKS pod-managed identities add-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity), no action is required. The clusters should now be running the `v1.8.13` release.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
