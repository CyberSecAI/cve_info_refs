Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23527:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `oidc_validate_redirect_url()` function within the `mod_auth_openidc` module. Specifically, the function fails to properly handle URLs that begin with a forward slash followed by a tab character (`/\t`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. By crafting a malicious URL that starts with `/\t`, an attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary external site.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code lacked proper checks to ensure the redirect URL is valid and safe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker can leverage the open redirect to create convincing phishing attacks. By redirecting users to a malicious website that mimics a legitimate one, they can steal credentials or sensitive information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly mentioned, open redirects can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to expose information or manipulate user behavior on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Logout Parameter:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted URL as the `logout` parameter within the redirect URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running `mod_auth_openidc`.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `logout` parameter in the redirect URI.
*   **Ability to craft malicious URL:** The attacker needs the ability to construct a malicious URL that starts with `/\t`.
*   **User Interaction:** The user is required to click on the malicious URL.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `mod_auth_openidc` versions `<= 2.4.12.1`.
*   The fix was implemented by adding an additional check for `/\t` in the `oidc_validate_redirect_url()` function.
*   The severity is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS v3 score of 4.7
*   A potential workaround is to configure `mod_auth_openidc` to only allow redirections to URLs matching a specific regular expression using the `OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed` configuration directive.
