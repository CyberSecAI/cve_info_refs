# (Mandatory)# Set a password for crypto purposes, this is used for:# - encryption of the (temporary) state cookie# - encryption of cache entries, that may include the session cookie, see: OIDCCacheEncrypt and OIDCSessionType# Note that an encrypted cache mechanism can be shared between servers if they use the same OIDCCryptoPassphrase# If the value begins with exec: the resulting command will be executed and the# first line returned to standard output by the program will be used as the password, e.g:# OIDCCryptoPassphrase "exec:/bin/bash -c \"head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 32\""# (notice that the above typically only works in non-clustered environments)# The command may be absolute or relative to the web server root.#OIDCCryptoPassphrase [ <passphrase> | "exec:/path/to/otherProgram arg1" ]

# Open Redirect in oidc\_validate\_redirect\_url() using tab character

Moderate

[zandbelt](/zandbelt)
published
GHSA-q6f2-285m-gr53
Dec 14, 2022

## Package

mod\_auth\_openidc

## Affected versions

<=2.4.12.1

## Patched versions

>=2.4.12.2

## Description

### Impact

When providing a `logout` parameter to the redirect URI, the existing code in `oidc_validate_redirect_url()` does not properly check for URLs that start with `/\t`, leading to an open redirect.

### Patches

This bug has been fixed by adding an additional check for `/\t` in `oidc_validate_redirect_url()`

### Workarounds

This vulnerability can mitigated by configuring mod\_auth\_openidc to only allow redirection whose destination matches a given regular expression with [OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed](https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/blob/v2.4.12.1/auth_openidc.conf#L975-L984).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : libapache2-mod-auth-openidc
Version        : 2.3.10.2-1+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-39191 CVE-2022-23527
Debian Bug     : 993648 1026444

Open Redirect vulnerabilities were found in libapache2-mod-auth-openidc,
OpenID Connect Relying Party implementation for Apache, which could lead
to information disclosure via phishing attacks.

CVE-2021-39191

    The 3rd-party init SSO functionality of mod_auth_openidc was
    reported to be vulnerable to an open redirect attack by supplying a
    crafted URL in the target_link_uri parameter.

CVE-2022-23527

    When providing a logout parameter to the redirect URI,
    mod_auth_openidc failed to properly check for URLs starting with
    "/\t", leading to an open redirect.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.3.10.2-1+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-auth-openidc packages.

For the detailed security status of libapache2-mod-auth-openidc please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
