Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ApiTestCaseService::deleteBodyFiles` method, which constructs a file path using a user-provided `testId` without proper sanitization. This allows for path injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application uses a user-controlled string (`testId`) to construct a file path without validation, enabling an attacker to traverse the file system using directory traversal sequences like `..%2F` and delete arbitrary files.
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-26):** The application fails to validate or sanitize the user-provided `testId` before using it in file path construction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An authenticated user, even with low privileges, can delete any file on the server by manipulating the `testId` parameter. This can lead to data loss, service disruption, and potential system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a GET request to the `/api/testcase/delete/{id}` endpoint, injecting directory traversal sequences (`..%2F`) in the `id` parameter to target files outside of the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the MeterSphere platform, although no specific administrative privileges are required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MeterSphere server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `ApiTestCaseService.java` file within the MeterSphere project.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.1 by adding input sanitization to prevent path traversal.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by using path traversal to delete a file outside of the intended directory.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 6.5 (Moderate) with an attack vector of Network, low complexity, low privileges required, no user interaction, no scope change, no confidentiality impact, no integrity impact, and high availability impact.
