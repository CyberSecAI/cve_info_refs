Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23628:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `groupIterable` function in the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/format` package handled the formatting of array literals.  Specifically, when an AST was created programmatically (resulting in terms with missing location data, such as wildcard variables or generated variables from partial evaluation), the pretty-printer could incorrectly reorder array literals. This reordering happened due to a change in how the elements were sorted during formatting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Sorting Logic:** The `groupIterable` function, responsible for grouping elements for formatting, previously relied on elements being passed in a specific order, which was no longer guaranteed after a change in the iteration order. It did not properly sort elements based on their location (specifically row number), leading to potential reordering.
- **Lack of Location Information:** The vulnerability is triggered by the presence of terms with missing location data, which can occur when ASTs are created programmatically or during partial evaluation and optimization, specifically when using optimized bundles (`opa build -O=1` or higher).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Logic Change:** Reordering array literals can lead to a change in the behavior of Rego policies. As illustrated in the example provided in the security advisory, a rule that relies on the order of elements within an array could be altered such that the policy evaluates differently.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** The change in policy logic can cause unexpected behavior in applications using OPA, potentially leading to security misconfigurations or incorrect authorization decisions.
- **Example:** The security advisory gives a concrete example where the reordering changes the outcome of a policy that splits an input resource by "/" and binds the result to an array.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Programmatically Created ASTs:** An attacker could construct a Rego policy, either through direct manipulation of AST or using OPA's Go API, that generates an AST containing synthetic nodes without location information
- **Optimized Bundles:** An attacker could generate a malicious Rego policy using OPA's optimized bundles (e.g., `opa build -O=1`), which creates synthetic nodes and triggers the bug during formatting.
- **Chain of Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered through a chain of operations: programmatically creating ASTs, pretty-printing them with the vulnerable formatter, parsing the result and re-evaluating the policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to create Rego policies with specific characteristics that result in terms with missing locations.
- The attacker needs the policies to be formatted with the vulnerable `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/format` package.
- The resulting formatted policy has to be parsed and evaluated by OPA.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced by a change related to sorting logic in pull request #3851 and backported for the 0.33.1 patch release.
- The fix was implemented by commit 932e4ff and 2bd8eda, and also backported to v0.33.1.
- The issue was found by Johannes Larsson.
- The severity was determined to be moderate because the conditions to trigger it are specific.

This detailed information goes beyond the basic CVE description by outlining the specific circumstances that trigger the vulnerability, its impact, how it can be exploited, and the necessary attacker position and capabilities.
