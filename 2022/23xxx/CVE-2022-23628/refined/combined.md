This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

format: don't group iterable when one has defaulted location ([#4260](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4260))

```
As mentioned in the comment, empty file names happen when the format
package's Ast() function does a sweep of its input, and adds a
"default location" to everything that has a nil location.

During PE, when generated the pairs to save in saveUnify, we'll
return Var Terms without locations. Fixing that seemed like a bigger
hurdle, so I went this route.

The new check is such that if any term has the default file in
its location, such as would happen if we're formatting code that
was created programmatically (not parsed), we'll group the terms'
elements, but print them in one line.

Before, it depended on the elements being passed in ordered by their rows.

Before [#3823](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3823), the iteration

order was the same as the row order; but with sorting the keys slice (which

determines iteration order) on creation, that was changed.

Now, we'll sort the elements within `groupIterable`.

Fixes [#3849](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3849).

---

For [#3849](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3849), this means that the ordering that matters for formatting literal objects in rego code is

the row ordering. This PR reverts the behavioural change that would make the formatter print those

with their keys sorted.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This reverts the crucial bit of [#3823](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3823) that *should* have given this bug away but that I didn't notice in its full extent.

Sorry, something went wrong.

actually measure what was intended, but rather the presence or ab-
sence of duplicate keys.

Now, we'll create a set of keys to insert before, and either shuffle
it or use it in its increasing order: to call `(Object).Insert()` in

# Formatting generated code can change ordering of array literals

Moderate

[srenatus](/srenatus)
published
GHSA-hcw3-j74m-qc58
Feb 9, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/open-policy-agent/opa
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 0.33.1

## Patched versions

0.37.2

## Description

### Impact

Under certain conditions, pretty-printing an AST that contains synthetic nodes could change the logic of some statements by reordering array literals. Example of policies impacted are those that parse and compare web paths, see the example below.

**All of these** three conditions have to be met to create an adverse effect:

1. An AST of Rego had to be **created programmatically** such that it ends up containing terms without a location (such as wildcard variables).
2. The AST had to be **pretty-printed** using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/format` package.
3. The result of the pretty-printing had to be **parsed and evaluated again** via an OPA instance using the bundles, or the Golang packages.

If any of these three conditions are not met, you are not affected.

Notably, all three would be true if using **optimized bundles**, i.e. bundles created with `opa build -O=1` or higher.

In that case, the optimizer would fulfil condition (1.), the result of that would be pretty-printed when writing the bundle to disk, fulfilling (2.). When the bundle was then used, we'd satisfy (3.).

#### Example

For example, the process outlined above could turn

this rule

```
hello {
	["foo", _] = split(input.resource, "/")
}
```

into

```
hello {
	[_, "foo"] = split(input.resource, "/")
}
```

with an input of

```
{
    "resource": "foo/bar"
}
```

the result would change from

```
{
    "hello": true
}
```

to (no default value of hello)

```
{}
```

The severity was determined to be *moderate* because the conditions are quite particular. Please note that its only the OPA bundle build process thats affected. An OPA sidecar of version 0.36.0 with an optimized bundle built by OPA 0.32.1 would not face this bug.

### Patches

Fixed in version 0.37.2.

### Workarounds

* Disabling optimization when creating bundles.

* Introduced in [#3851](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3851)
* Backported for the 0.33.1 patch release: [bfd984d](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/bfd984ddf93ef2c4963a08d4fdadae0bcf1a3717)
* Fixed by [932e4ff](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/932e4ffc37a590ace79e9b75ca4340288c220239) and [2bd8eda](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/2bd8edab9e10e2dc9cf76ae8335ced0c224f3055)

```
Before, it depended on the elements being passed in ordered by their rows.
Before [#3823](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3823), the iteration
order was the same as the row order; but with sorting the keys slice (which
determines iteration order) on creation, that was changed.

Now, we'll sort the elements within `groupIterable`.

Fixes [#3849](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3849).
