Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23604:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `issue-command` function within the Defender cog. It failed to properly check if the user issuing the command has the necessary permissions to view the target channel where the command is being executed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient permission check: The `issue-command` function did not verify if the command issuer had the `view_channel` permission for the channel where the command would be executed.
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker with admin privileges on a shared server could exploit the lack of permission checks to execute commands as other users, including bot owners.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: An attacker could bypass permission checks and execute commands with elevated privileges of other users.
- Unauthorized command execution: By masquerading as other users, the attacker can execute commands that they would normally not have the permission to use.
- Potential bot compromise: If the attacker shares a server with the bot owner, they could execute bot-owner restricted commands, potentially leading to bot compromise or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `issue-command` function within the Defender cog.
- An attacker with admin privileges on a server that the bot also resides on can use the `issue-command` functionality to execute commands as another user who shares that same server

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have admin privileges on a server where the vulnerable bot is also present.
- The attacker needs to be able to use the `issue-command` functionality provided by the Defender cog.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of the Defender cog up to and including v1.9.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version v1.10.0 by adding a check for the `view_channel` permission before executing the command.
- A GitHub Security Advisory was created for this vulnerability: [GHSA-cfh8-v56j-5757](https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/security/advisories/GHSA-cfh8-v56j-5757).
