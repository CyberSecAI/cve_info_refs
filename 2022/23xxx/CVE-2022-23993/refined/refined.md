Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and encoding of the `pkg_filter` parameter within the `pkg.php` file of the pfSense web GUI. Specifically, the code takes user-supplied input from the `pkg_filter` parameter and uses it to construct a regular expression without adequate escaping. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript through the `pkg_filter` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input is directly included in the HTML output without proper encoding, making it possible to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or properly escape the `pkg_filter` input before using it within a regular expression or including it in the HTML output.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The code does not HTML encode the output containing the `pkg_filter` value, making the XSS attack possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user accessing the affected page.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal the user's session cookie, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the pfSense system.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can gain access to other session information or sensitive data visible within the web GUI.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as changing configurations, adding new firewall rules, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Reflected XSS:** The attack vector is a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript in the `pkg_filter` parameter. When a user clicks on this malicious link, the JavaScript is executed within their browser in the context of the web GUI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL containing the malicious JavaScript code in the `pkg_filter` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a user (with access to the pfSense web GUI) into clicking the crafted URL. This can be done via email, a web page, or other methods. The attack is successful if a user of the vulnerable pfSense system clicks a link containing the payload.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in older versions of pfSense Plus and pfSense CE software prior to versions 22.01 and 2.6.0, respectively.
- The fix involves sanitizing the input in `pkg.php` to prevent JavaScript injection and encoding the output to prevent XSS.
- The provided github commit shows changes to `src/usr/local/www/pkg.php` where the input from `$_REQUEST['pkg_filter']` is now cleaned with `cleanup_regex_pattern()` before being used.
- The Netgate advisory also mentions that the problem exists due to the lack of sanitization and output encoding.
