- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An XSS vulnerability exists in Kibana index patterns.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into an index pattern, which can then execute against other users of the Kibana instance. This could lead to the attacker gaining access to sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of other users.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with permissions to create index patterns can inject malicious javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with permissions to create index patterns.
