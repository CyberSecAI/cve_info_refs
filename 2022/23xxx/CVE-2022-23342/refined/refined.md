- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OnBase application is susceptible to Active Directory username enumeration during authentication due to the system returning different error responses for valid and invalid usernames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Username enumeration vulnerability. The application returns distinct error messages based on whether a given username is valid or invalid.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can identify valid Active Directory usernames. This information can be used in further attacks, such as password guessing or credential stuffing.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker sends a login POST request to the `/mobilebroker/ServiceToBroker.svc/Json/Connect` endpoint. By analyzing the responses, the attacker can distinguish between valid and invalid usernames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the OnBase application and does not need to be authenticated.
