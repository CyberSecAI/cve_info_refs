Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-23652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `Connection` header in HTTP requests by `capsule-proxy`. Specifically, the proxy was not stripping out hop-by-hop headers such as `Impersonate-User` and `Impersonate-Group` when forwarding requests to the Kubernetes API server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Header Handling:** The `capsule-proxy` failed to remove the `Connection` header which is considered a hop-by-hop header, and any other headers listed in its value, before forwarding the request to the Kubernetes API server.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  By including `Impersonate-User` or `Impersonate-Group` within the `Connection` header, an attacker could manipulate the proxy into making requests to the Kubernetes API server with the proxy's service account permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could effectively bypass tenant restrictions and gain cluster-admin level privileges by impersonating the capsule-proxy service account.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could access and modify resources they wouldn't normally have access to.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could access or leak sensitive data managed by the Kubernetes cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTTP Request:** Attackers could craft a malicious HTTP request to the `capsule-proxy` including a `Connection` header that contains `Impersonate-User` and/or `Impersonate-Group`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `capsule-proxy`.
- **Valid Authentication:** The attacker would need a valid authentication mechanism accepted by the `capsule-proxy` to initiate the malicious request.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version v0.2.1 of `capsule-proxy` by properly removing hop-by-hop headers, including those specified in the `Connection` header, before forwarding requests to the Kubernetes API server.
- This vulnerability is similar to the one described in GHSA-pvxj-25m6-7vqr, which affected Rancher.
- The provided files include the code changes introduced to mitigate the vulnerability, specifically the function `removingHopByHopHeaders` in `internal/webserver/webserver.go` which removes all headers listed in the `Connection` header, except `upgrade`, which is handled specifically.
