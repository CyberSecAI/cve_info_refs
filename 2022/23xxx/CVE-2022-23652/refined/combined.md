| A user crafting an API request directed at `capsule-proxy` can get a privilege escalation using the Service Account of the proxy itself.  This is done by passing the `Impersonate-User` or `Impersonate-Group` header in the `Connection` header, using the same exploit described here: [GHSA-pvxj-25m6-7vqr](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-pvxj-25m6-7vqr "GHSA-pvxj-25m6-7vqr")  At this point, instead of impersonating the user and their permissions, the request will act as if it was from the ~~Rancher management server~~ Capsule Proxy and incorrectly return the information. |
