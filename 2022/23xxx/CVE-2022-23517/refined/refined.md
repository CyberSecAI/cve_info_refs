Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23517:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of an inefficient regular expression in `rails-html-sanitizer` when sanitizing certain SVG attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inefficient Regular Expression:** The regular expression used for sanitizing SVG attributes is susceptible to excessive backtracking.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** This inefficiency can lead to a DoS condition due to high CPU resource consumption when processing specially crafted SVG attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing input that triggers the inefficient regular expression, leading to excessive CPU consumption and potentially making the service unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be initiated remotely over the network.
- **Crafted SVG Attributes:** The attack requires the attacker to supply specifically crafted SVG attributes that trigger the inefficient regular expression.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be carried out without any user interaction.
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located remotely.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in `rails-html-sanitizer` versions prior to 1.4.4.
- The fix involves replacing the slow regular expression with a more efficient method (Loofah method with Crass parser)
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity.
- The severity is rated as High with a CVSS score of 7.5.
