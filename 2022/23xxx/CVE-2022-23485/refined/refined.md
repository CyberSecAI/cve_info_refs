- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate cookies associated with organization invite links, allowing the same invite link to be reused on multiple accounts, even after the initial use.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of invite link cookies, allowing for reuse and circumventing the intended one-time use of invite links. This is related to improper access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create multiple user accounts and join an organization using a single valid invite link. This can lead to unauthorized access and potentially disrupt the organization or perform malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to be able to send requests to the Sentry instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a valid invite link to the targeted organization. They do not need to be authenticated initially. They need the ability to manipulate cookies in their browser or with a tool that can modify HTTP headers and cookies. They also need to interact with the Sentry web application.
