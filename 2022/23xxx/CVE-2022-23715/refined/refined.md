- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insertion of sensitive information, such as user passwords and Elasticsearch keystore settings, into logs within the Logging and Monitoring cluster. This occurs when using the following APIs:
    - `PATCH /api/v1/user`
    - `PATCH /deployments/{deployment_id}/elasticsearch/{ref_id}/keystore`

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the logging of sensitive data. Specifically, the application logs user passwords and Elasticsearch keystore settings in plaintext within the audit and deployment logs. This is a violation of secure logging practices, leading to sensitive information disclosure. The CWE is CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the logs could potentially gain access to user credentials and sensitive Elasticsearch keystore values. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to user accounts
    - Unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster
    - Data breaches

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves accessing the logs where sensitive information is being recorded. Specifically, the audit and deployment logs within the Logging and Monitoring cluster are vulnerable.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the following capabilities:
    - Access to the Logging and Monitoring cluster.
    - Privilege to view the audit logs or deployment logs. By default, only Platform Admin users have this access
