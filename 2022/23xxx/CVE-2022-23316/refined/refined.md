  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The path parameter is passed directly to the file_get_contents function without filtering.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [

  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the path parameter in the file management interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be logged in as an admin and have access to the file management interface."
