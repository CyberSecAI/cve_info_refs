Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `treq` library's request methods were not binding cookies to a specific domain. Instead, they were acting as "supercookies", sent to every domain regardless of origin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive cookie data could be exposed when an HTTP redirect occurs to a different domain.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   If a user makes a request to `example.com` with a cookie, and `example.com` redirects to `cloudstorageprovider.com`, the cookie meant only for `example.com` will be sent to `cloudstorageprovider.com`. This could leak sensitive information such as session IDs.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could potentially set up a malicious server or website that redirects an unsuspecting user to another domain after the user makes a request with cookies using the affected `treq` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to control a server or website that a user's application might interact with through the vulnerable `treq` library and be able to trigger a redirect to a different domain.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `treq` versions before 22.1.0.
*   The fix involves binding the cookies to the origin of the URL parameter.
*   A workaround was provided which involves using `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instances with properly domain- and scheme-scoped cookies.
*   The advisory also references a related vulnerability in Twisted 22.1 regarding HTTP basic authentication (CVE-2022-21712).
