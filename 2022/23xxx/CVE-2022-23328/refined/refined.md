    "Primary_data": {
      "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-23328",
      "CVE_Description": "The provided text describes a vulnerability in the transaction pool (txpool) of Ethereum clients, specifically Geth, Parity, Nethermind, and Besu. The vulnerability allows for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through the exploitation of transaction handling weaknesses. This is achieved through the manipulation of future and latent invalid transactions, leading to the eviction of legitimate transactions.",
      "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the optimistic transaction handling within Ethereum clients. These clients are designed to maximize miner revenue by admitting future transactions and latent invalid transactions in the hope that they will eventually become valid. This behavior allows attackers to exploit these mechanisms by injecting specially crafted, low-cost transactions that lead to txpool service denial.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Flawed transaction handling in Ethereum clients",
        "Overly optimistic admission control in txpool",
        "Acceptance of future transactions",
        "Acceptance of latent invalid transactions",
        "Lack of proper validation of transactions before admitting them to the txpool."
        ],
       "Impact": "An attacker can disable a remote Ethereum node's txpool, denying critical downstream services such as mining, transaction propagation, and Gas station functionality. By targeting centralized network services like mining pools and transaction relay services, this can lead to global disruption of the Ethereum network.",
      "Attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted future transactions to evict normal transactions (DETER-X)",
        "Sending crafted latent invalid transactions to evict normal transactions (DETER-Z)",
        "Using RPC service to send local future transactions that resize the txpool (DETER-Y)"
      ],
      "Required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to connect to the victim node as a neighbor.",
        "Ability to send specially crafted transactions to the victim node.",
        "Knowledge of the txpool's eviction behavior.",
        "For targeted attacks, knowledge of the services dependent on the txpool and their read behavior."
      ]
    },
     "Secondary_data": {
       "Additional_details": "The paper provides several concrete attack variants and discusses how they exploit specific vulnerabilities in transaction handling in the txpool. These attacks are designed to be low cost in terms of ether for the attacker. The paper also discusses techniques for discovering vulnerable nodes on the network and proposes mitigation strategies. It also provides evaluation results on various clients and testnets, showing the effectiveness of these attacks."
