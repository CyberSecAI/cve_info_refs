Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-23713:

**Root Cause:**
- A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the Vega Charts Kibana integration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in a victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the Vega Charts integration within Kibana. The attacker injects malicious Javascript through the Vega Charts feature.
- The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack requires low privileges (PR:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious code into a Vega chart. They need to have some level of access to the Kibana interface, specifically the functionality that interacts with Vega charts. The user interaction is not required for the exploitation.

**Affected Versions:**
- Versions 7.0.0 through 7.17.4
- Versions 8.0.0 through 8.2.3

**Patched Versions:**
- 8.3.0
- 7.17.5

**Mitigation:**
- Disable Vega visualizations.
    - For on-premise installations: set `vis_type_vega.enabled: false` (or `vega.enabled: false` for Kibana versions older than 7.7.0) in the `kibana.yml` file.
    - For Elastic Cloud Services deployments: reach out to Elastic Support.

**CVSSv3:**
- 6.4 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
