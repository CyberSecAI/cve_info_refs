{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the phpMyAdmin setup script, specifically the 'mode' and 'id' parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "HTML injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary malicious code, potentially leading to execution of malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser. This could be leveraged to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive information (like cookies), or redirect to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the phpMyAdmin setup script with a malicious payload injected into the 'mode' or 'id' URL parameters.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires knowledge of a vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance and the ability to send HTTP requests to it."
  },
  "other_details": {
    "affected_versions": "phpMyAdmin versions of the 5.1 branch prior to 5.1.2 are affected.",
    "mitigation": "A phpMyAdmin installation with a configuration file config.inc.php will not allow access to the setup script, which in turn mitigates this attack.",
    "fix": "Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 5.1.2 or newer or apply the provided patches."
