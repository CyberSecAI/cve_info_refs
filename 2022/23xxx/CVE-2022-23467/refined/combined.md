We're using this value for some bounds checks and we should ensure that
we don't potentially get a data_size that's bigger than the arguments
array to avoid out of bounds reads.

Moderate

[z3ntu](/z3ntu)
published
GHSA-39hg-jvc9-fg7h
Dec 4, 2022

## Package

OpenRazer

## Affected versions

<= v3.5.0

## Patched versions

v3.5.1

## Description

### Impact

Using a modified USB device an attacker can leak stack addresses of the `razer_attr_read_dpi_stages`, potentially bypassing KASLR.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in v3.5.1.

### Workarounds

Don't plug unknown USB devices into your computer.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
