- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input sanitization/validation leading to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by user interaction (UI:R) and it's network-based (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit this remotely by enticing a user to interact with crafted content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any special privileges or prior authentication (PR:N). The attacker needs to get a user to interact with malicious content.
