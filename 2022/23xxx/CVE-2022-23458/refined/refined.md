Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the `nhn/tui.grid` component handles HTML content pasted into editable cells. Specifically, the component was not sanitizing the pasted HTML content, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS issue. The component was not properly sanitizing the HTML content from the clipboard when pasting into editable cells.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code failed to sanitize the HTML input before rendering it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Pasting malicious HTML:** An attacker would need to craft malicious HTML containing JavaScript (e.g., using an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event) and copy it to the clipboard.
*   **Targeted user action:** A user of the vulnerable grid component would then paste this crafted HTML into an editable cell of the grid.
*   **JavaScript execution:** When the user exits the cell, the unsanitized HTML content is rendered, and the malicious JavaScript is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTML containing embedded JavaScript code.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker relies on a user of the vulnerable application to copy the crafted HTML content and paste it into an editable cell within the `tui.grid` component.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Toast UI Grid version 4.21.1.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the pasted HTML using `DOMPurify` library before rendering it.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by the GitHub Security Lab team using a CodeQL query.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) was provided to demonstrate the vulnerability.

This vulnerability is effectively a stored XSS that can be triggered via copy and paste.
