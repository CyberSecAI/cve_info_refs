## Details

### Issue: XSS pasting HTML in editable cell (`GHSL-2022-029`)

There is a vulnerability when specially crafted html content [is pasted](https://github.com/nhn/tui.grid/blob/9112312d2aff08f5b4ac36d02a51b83e7b7f070f/packages/toast-ui.grid/src/view/clipboard.tsx#L118) in an editable cell.

2. Paste `<img src="" onerror="alert(123)" />` into the HTML Input box and click `Copy as HTML`
3. Go to https://ui.toast.com/tui-grid
4. Double click an input cell (eg. one in the “Artist” column), and paste the HTML you copied in [2].
5. Exit the cell by clicking any other cell.
6. JavaScript: `alert(123)` is executed.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to XSS.
