- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jodit Editor 3 does not properly sanitize HTML input when pasting, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts. Specifically, the `strip-tags.ts` file (likely in the sanitization process) is bypassed by the provided payload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper sanitization of HTML input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the editor, which can then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the content is rendered. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing pages.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through pasting crafted HTML content into the Jodit Editor. The attacker needs to create specific HTML that bypasses the editor's sanitization mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTML that includes JavaScript code and have the ability to trick or encourage a user to copy that HTML and paste into the Jodit Editor.
