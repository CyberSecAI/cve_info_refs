## Summary

Jodit Editor 3 is vulnerable to XSS attacks when pasting specially constructed input.

## Product

Jodit Editor 3

## Tested Version

[3.16.5](https://github.com/xdan/jodit/releases/tag/3.16.5)

## Details

### Issue: XSS in jodit editor (`GHSL-2022-030`)

This [query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-xss/) highlights several locations, all of which I believe to be exploitable. I *believe* [this](https://github.com/xdan/jodit/blob/cedc9e763088646bb8541075552655d003c7edaf/src/core/helpers/html/strip-tags.ts#L27) is the location triggered by the PoC.

#### PoC:

1. Open https://cdn.sekurak.pl/copy-paste/playground.html in your browser, enter the text below in the HTML Input box:

```
<html>
  <body>
  <meta name=Generator content="Microsoft Word 15">
  <img src="" onerror="alert(123)" />
  </body>
</html>

```

1. Click `Copy as HTML`.
2. Go to https://xdsoft.net/jodit/
3. Paste the text you copied in [3].
4. Click `Keep`.
5. JavaScript: `alert(123)` is executed.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to XSS in any webpage that uses the editor. Users who copy-paste content from a page controlled by an attacker may be vulnerable.
