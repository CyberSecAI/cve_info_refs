                 983479 989147 990542

This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
affects character set conversion.

CVE-2016-10228

    The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
    suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
    the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2019-19126

    On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
    LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
    execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
    restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
    thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

CVE-2019-25013

    The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
    over-read.

CVE-2020-10029

    The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
    reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
    non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
    0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
    to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

CVE-2020-1752

    A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
    way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
    an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
    issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
    specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
    would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2020-27618

    The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
    and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
    lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
    service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

CVE-2020-6096

    An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
    memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
    targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
    value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
    vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
    memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
    writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
    execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
    program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
    or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
    execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
    corrupted data.

CVE-2021-27645

    The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
    processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
    double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
    Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

CVE-2021-3326

    The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
    the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-33574

    The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
    may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
    its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
    leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
    unspecified other impact.

CVE-2021-35942

    The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
    memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
    untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
    service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
    used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

CVE-2021-3999

    An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
    memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
    attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
    in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
    arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

CVE-2022-23218

    The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
    module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
    without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
    potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
    is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2022-23219

    The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
    of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
    validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
    potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
    not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.28-10+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc packages.

# [PATCH] avoid buffer overflow in sunrpc clnt\_create (BZ #22542)

* *From*: Martin Sebor <msebor at gmail dot com>
* *To*: Carlos O'Donell <carlos at redhat dot com>, GNU C Library <libc-alpha at sourceware dot org>
* *Date*: Sun, 3 Dec 2017 16:09:34 -0700

```

Annotating sockaddr_un::sun_path with attribute nonstring as
suggested by Carlos in [1] triggers a warning for call to strlen()
with the array as an argument in the clntunix_create() function.

The only caller of the function in Glibc, clnt_create(), calls
strcpy() to copy the string passed to it as the hostname argument
to the sun_path array member of a local struct sockadd_un object.
This causes a buffer overflow when the string is longer than
the size of the sun_path member array.

The attached patch tries to fix both of these problems.

It annotates the sun_path array member of struct sockaddr_un
with attribute nonstring.

It then changes clntunix_create() to use strnlen() instead of
strlen() to read as most as many characters from the sun_path
array as it has elements.

Finally, the patch changes the clnt_create() function to reject
hostnames longer than sizeof (sun_path) to avoid the overflow.

I considered changing clnt_create() to dynamically allocate
a larger object than sizeof (struct sockaddr_un) to fit the
whole hostname but decided to keep it simple.  Longer names
aren't supported now (they cause a buffer overflow) and since
no one complained, it seems good enough.  However, if it is
considered important to handle longer hostnames, it can be
changed.

Given the approach I chose in clnt_create(), using strnlen()
in clntunix_create() isn't really necessary to avoid reading
past the end of sun_path because it's nul-terminated, but it
is necessary to avoid the warning.

If it's decided that clnt_create() should handle overlong
hostnames then clntunix_create() will need to change back
to use either strlen(sun_path) and the warning will need
to be suppressed by some other means, or to use memchr().

Thanks
Martin

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=22542#c0)  Martin Sebor    2017-12-03 22:27:53 UTC  ``` The clnt_create() function calls strcpy() to copy the string pointed to by the hostname argument to the sun_addr member array of a struct sockaddr_un object allocated on the stack.  When the string is longer than fits in the array the function corrupts the calling process' stack due to the buffer overflow.  I noticed this while developing the patch suggested here: <https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2017-11/msg00932.html>.  $ cat d.c && gcc -Wall d.c && valgrind ./a.out  #include <errno.h> #include <rpc/clnt.h> #include <sys/socket.h> #include <sys/un.h> #include <string.h>  int main () {   char name [sizeof ((struct sockaddr_un*)0)->sun_path * 2];   memset (name, 'x', sizeof name - 1);   name [sizeof name - 1] = '\0';    CLIENT *clnt = clnt_create (name, 0, 0, "unix");    if (clnt)     clnt_destroy (clnt); } ==18499== Memcheck, a memory error detector ==18499== Copyright (C) 2002-2015, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al. ==18499== Using Valgrind-3.12.0 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info ==18499== Command: ./a.out ==18499==  ==18499== Source and destination overlap in strcpy(0xffefffcc2, 0xffefffd70) ==18499==    at 0x4C30E06: __GI_strcpy (vg_replace_strmem.c:507) ==18499==    by 0x4F6FE30: clnt_create (in /usr/lib64/libc-2.24.so) ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878780077: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==  ==18499== Jump to the invalid address stated on the next line ==18499==    at 0x7878787878787878: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878780077: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==  Address 0x7878787878787878 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd ==18499==  ==18499==  ==18499== Process terminating with default action of signal 11 (SIGSEGV) ==18499==  Bad permissions for mapped region at address 0x7878787878787878 ==18499==    at 0x7878787878787878: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878780077: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==    by 0x7878787878787877: ??? ==18499==  ==18499== HEAP SUMMARY: ==18499==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks ==18499==   total heap usage: 2 allocs, 2 frees, 272 bytes allocated ==18499==  ==18499== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible ==18499==  ==18499== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v ==18499== ERROR SUMMARY: 2 errors from 2 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0) Segmentation fault (core dumped) ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=22542#c1)  Martin Sebor    2017-12-03 23:10:24 UTC  ``` Patch posted for review: <https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2017-12/msg00058.html> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=22542#c2)  Florian Weimer    2022-01-17 13:06:49 UTC  ``` Fixed for glibc 2.35 via:  commit 226b46770c82899b555986583294b049c6ec9b40 Author: Florian Weimer <fweimer@redhat.com> Date:   Mon Jan 17 10:21:34 2022 +0100      CVE-2022-23219: Buffer overflow in sunrpc clnt_create for "unix" ([bug 22542](show_bug.cgi?id=22542 "RESOLVED FIXED - buffer overflow in sunrpc clnt_create (CVE-2022-23219)"))          Processing an overlong pathname in the sunrpc clnt_create function     results in a stack-based buffer overflow.
