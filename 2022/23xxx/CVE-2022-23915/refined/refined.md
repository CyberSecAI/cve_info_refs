Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23915

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when constructing commands for Git and Mercurial version control systems. Specifically, arguments passed to these systems were not adequately neutralized, which allowed malicious users to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-77, CWE-88):** The core issue is that user input is directly incorporated into system commands without proper validation or escaping. This enables attackers to manipulate the executed commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious arguments into Git or Mercurial commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Weblate application.
- **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** An attacker could gain full control of the system, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying files, and disrupting services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Through Version Control System:**  Attackers inject malicious parameters via the configuration of version control repositories (Git/Mercurial).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:**  Attackers need to be authenticated users of the Weblate application.
- **Component Creation:** Attackers need the ability to create new components (translation projects) within Weblate, or at least modify existing ones.
- **Knowledge of Git/Mercurial Parameter Injection:** Requires knowledge of how to exploit git/mercurial parameter handling.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when Weblate constructs commands for interacting with Git or Mercurial repositories. Malicious users can inject specially crafted arguments, such as `--config=alias.pull=!id>/app/cache/static/output_rce.txt`, into the repository branch setting. This particular example will execute the "id" command and save its output to `/app/cache/static/output_rce.txt`, which would then be accessible via HTTP.
- The issue was addressed in Weblate version 4.11.1 with specific commits: `35d59f1f040541c358cece0a8d4a63183ca919b8` and `d83672a3e7415da1490334e2c9431e5da1966842`. These commits implemented proper sanitization and handling of user-provided input.
- The vulnerability is related to pull requests #7337 (Mercurial) and #7338 (Git).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- Instances where untrusted users cannot create new components are not affected.
- The EPSS score is 0.298% (69th percentile), indicating moderate likelihood of exploitation in the wild.
- CVSS v4 score: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N
