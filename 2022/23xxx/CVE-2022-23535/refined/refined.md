Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how LiteDB deserializes JSON documents into POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) classes. It uses a special field `_type` within the JSON to determine the class type. If the instance of an object isn't the same as the expected class, `BsonMapper` uses the `_type` field to load a class based on its full name and assembly, which is provided as a string within the JSON.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Deserialization:** The core issue is that if an attacker can control the `_type` field in the JSON, they can potentially force the application to load and instantiate arbitrary classes.
- **Type Confusion:** The system attempts to load a type from a string which can be tampered with.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability arises because the application doesn't sanitize or validate the class names provided in the `_type` field before deserializing it.
- **Over-reliance on String Matching:** The fix implemented in the commit uses string matching (e.g. `actualType.FullName.Equals("System.Diagnostics.Process", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)`) to block `System.Diagnostics.Process` from loading but is not a robust solution for arbitrary class loading.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious class name within the `_type` field in a JSON document, an attacker can force the application to load that class, which could lead to remote code execution.
- **Arbitrary Object Instantiation:** The attacker can instantiate objects of their choosing, potentially bypassing security mechanisms or causing application instability.
- **Denial of Service:** Malicious class instantiation can cause the application to crash or consume excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JSON Injection:** An attacker can inject a crafted JSON string with a malicious `_type` value during insert or update operations if the application does not validate the input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send JSON Data:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted JSON strings to the application or endpoint where deserialization occurs with vulnerable `Object` types present in the model.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the target system's assemblies and classes to craft a successful exploit.

**Mitigation:**
- The patch included in commit `4382ff4` adds a check to prevent the loading of `System.Diagnostics.Process` class by string matching the full class name.
- The advisory suggests avoiding accepting plain JSON strings from users to be directly inserted/updated into the database and to avoid using `Object` types.
- The advisory suggests using interfaces or specific types instead of the generic `Object` type in classes.
- A more comprehensive fix, mentioned in the advisory, involves adding an allow-list of assemblies and types that are allowed to be loaded during deserialization.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content includes code diffs from the commit `4382ff4` which show the specific changes made to address the vulnerability. Specifically, checks were added to `BsonMapper.Deserialize.cs` to prevent the deserialization of `System.Diagnostics.Process` class.
- The advisory explicitly mentions that the patch added is not 100% guaranteed when using `Object` type and is a temporary fix.
- The advisory provides a concrete example illustrating bad (using `Object`) and good (using `IDictionary<string, string>`) class definitions.

This information provides a good understanding of CVE-2022-23535.
