    - FreshRSS web interface (bcrypt, cost 9, salted).
    - GReader API (bcrypt, cost 9, salted) - if API is used.
    - Fever API (MD5 salted) - if API is used.
- **Database Access:** If SQLite is used as a database, the database of the given user can also be accessed.
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker could potentially use these exposed credentials to gain access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Username Guessing:** Attackers need to guess usernames to access the corresponding configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
