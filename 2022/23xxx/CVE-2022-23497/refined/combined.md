# Insecure file access in ext.php allows exposure of user configuration

Moderate

[Alkarex](/Alkarex)
published
GHSA-hvrj-5fwj-p7v6
Dec 9, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 1.18.0, <= 1.20.1

## Patched versions

1.20.2

## Description

### Impact

User configuration files can be accessed remotely, if an attacker can guess usernames. In addition to user preferences, such configurations contain hashed passwords (brypt with cost 9, salted) of FreshRSS Web interface. If the API is used, the configuration might contain a hashed password (brypt with cost 9, salted) of the GReader API, and a hashed password (MD5 salted) of the Fever API.

If using SQLite as a database, the database of a the given user can also be accessed.

### Patches

Administrators should update to [version 1.20.2](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/releases/tag/1.20.2) or edge.

Then, users should change their FreshRSS and potentially API passwords.

### Workarounds

Besides updating (recommended), admins of older systems can apply the patch manually, or delete the file `./FreshRSS/p/ext.php` (which will break some extensions).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
