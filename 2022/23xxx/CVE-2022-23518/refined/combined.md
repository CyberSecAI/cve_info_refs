rails-html-sanitizer
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.3, < 1.4.4

## Patched versions

## Description

## Summary

rails-html-sanitizer `>= 1.0.3, < 1.4.4` is vulnerable to cross-site scripting via data URIs when used in combination with Loofah `>= 2.1.0`.

## Mitigation

Upgrade to rails-html-sanitizer `>= 1.4.4`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@goromlagche](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4189070?u=b71cc7f6c10e431ebfadbb5d8767db807d1ca986&v=4&size=48)[goromlagche](https://github.com/goromlagche)opened [on Jun 8, 2022](https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/issues/135#issue-1264633459)

Currently in the scrub\_attribute method, there is divergence between the code present in loofah

<https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/blob/main/lib/loofah/html5/scrub.rb#L38-L61>

vs how it is handle in the PermitScrubber class

<https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/blob/master/lib/rails/html/scrubbers.rb#L142-L154>

The section around safe data uri is missing

Because of this, a base64 encoded XSS script can be injected. I have attached a test for the same.

```
  def test_sanitize_data_protocol
    text = '- XSS><iframe src="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4=">- XSS><iframe src="data:application/vnd.wap.xhtml+xml;base64,PHg6c2NyaXB0IHhtbG5zOng9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzE5OTkveGh0bWwiPmFsZXJ0KGRvY3VtZW50LmRvbWFpbik8L3g6c2NyaXB0Pg=="></iframe></iframe>'

    scope_allowed_tags %w(iframe) do
      scope_allowed_attributes %w(src) do
        assert_equal %(- XSS\"&gt;<iframe>- XSS\"&gt;<iframe></iframe></iframe>), safe_list_sanitize(text)
      end
    end
  end

```

The test fails with

```
  1) Failure:
SanitizersTest#test_sanitize_data_protocol [/home/goromlagche/work/rails-html-sanitizer/test/sanitizer_test.rb:523]:
--- expected

```

Unable to scrub the base64 encoded script.

I am not well accustomed to this project or loofah, but I tried updating the corresponding code to be in sync with loofah, and that seems to solve the xss problem. Change is in PR [#134](https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/pull/134)

CVE ID         : CVE-2022-23517 CVE-2022-23518 CVE-2022-23519 CVE-2022-23520
Debian Bug     : 1027153

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Rails HTML Sanitizers, an
HTML sanitization library for Ruby on Rails applications. An attacker
could launch cross-site scripting (XSS) and denial-of-service (DoS)
attacks through crafted HTML/XML documents.

CVE-2022-23517

    Certain configurations use an inefficient regular expression that
    is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to
    sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of
    service through CPU resource consumption.

CVE-2022-23518

    Cross-site scripting via data URIs when used in combination with
    Loofah >= 2.1.0.

CVE-2022-23519

    XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
    Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if
    the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed
    tags in either of the following ways: allow both "math" and
    "style" elements, or allow both "svg" and "style" elements.

CVE-2022-23520

    XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
    Rails::Html::Sanitizer due to an incomplete fix of
    CVE-2022-32209. Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to
    inject content if the application developer has overridden the
    sanitizer's allowed tags to allow both "select" and "style"
    elements.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.4-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-rails-html-sanitizer packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-rails-html-sanitizer please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-rails-html-sanitizer>
