The provided content is related to CVE-2022-23399.

**Root Cause:**
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `confsrv set_port_fwd_rule` function within the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when using `sprintf`.
- User-controlled data from the `ipadr` and `name` fields of a protobuf message is directly used in the format string for the `sprintf` function, allowing an attacker to write past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control over the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a specially-crafted network packet to port 9003 on the device.
- This packet contains a crafted `PortFwdList` protobuf message with overly long `ipadr` and/or `name` fields to overflow the stack buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same WiFi network as the LinkHub Mesh WiFi device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send raw network packets to the device.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
