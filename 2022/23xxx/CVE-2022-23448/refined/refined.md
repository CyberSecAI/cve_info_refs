- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper permission assignment to critical directories and files used by the application processes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect permission assignment (CWE-732).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation, leading to code execution with administrator or even NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  A local unprivileged attacker needs to have some level of access to the system, potentially requiring user interaction.
