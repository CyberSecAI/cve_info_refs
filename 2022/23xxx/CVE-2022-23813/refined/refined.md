{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The software interfaces to ASP and SMU may not enforce the SNP memory security policy.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of enforcement of the Secure Nested Paging (SNP) memory security policy by the software interfaces to the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) and System Management Unit (SMU).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A potential loss of integrity of guest memory in a confidential compute environment.",
  "Attack vectors": "Software interfaces to ASP and SMU",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to interact with the software interfaces to the ASP and SMU within a confidential compute environment."
