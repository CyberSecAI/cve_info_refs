  "CVE-2022-23327": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided text describes a vulnerability in Ethereum clients' transaction handling, specifically in the txpool (mempool), which allows for low-cost denial-of-service attacks. These attacks, named DETER, exploit flawed admission control to disable a node's txpool, impacting downstream services like mining and transaction propagation.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from Ethereum clients' loose transaction admission policies, designed to maximize miners' revenue. This includes optimistically admitting future and latent invalid transactions, which attackers can exploit to evict valid transactions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "**Optimistic Admission of Future Transactions (DETER-X):** Ethereum clients admit future transactions (transactions with nonces higher than the next expected nonce) in hopes that the preceding transactions will arrive, making them valid. Attackers can exploit this by sending high-gas-price future transactions that get admitted into the txpool, evicting valid pending transactions but never becoming valid.",
        "**Optimistic Admission of Latent Invalid Transactions (DETER-Z):** Ethereum clients admit transactions that are valid at the time of arrival but become invalid later (e.g., overdraft transactions). Attackers can exploit this by sending high-gas-price sequences of such transactions from the same account to evict valid pending transactions."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of the DETER vulnerabilities can lead to denial-of-service of the Ethereum node's txpool. This has several downstream impacts:\n\t* **Disabled mining:** Miners may end up mining empty blocks or blocks with few attacker-controlled transactions, leading to low or zero revenue for miners, and lower transaction throughput for the network.\n\t* **Failed transaction propagation:** Valid transactions may not get propagated to the rest of the network, causing delays or failures in the completion of legitimate operations. The attack can prevent a victim node from propagating transactions.\n\t* **Compromised DApp services:** Services relying on txpool data, such as Gas stations, can be manipulated, leading to incorrect real-time estimates of Gas prices, and prevent dapps from seeing correct information. The attack can block or cause delays to transactions sent through RPC services, such as infura.io or blockdaemon.\n\t* **Potential for global disruption:** By targeting centralized network services like mining pools and transaction relays, a DETER attack can be amplified to cause widespread disruption.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker node connects to a victim node as a peer and propagates crafted transactions.",
          "An attacker sends crafted messages encoding future transactions to the victim node.",
           "An attacker sends crafted messages encoding latent invalid transactions to the victim node.",
             "An attacker sends transactions through a victim RPC web service that accepts JSON requests.",
           "An attacker leverages Ethereum's transaction replacement to observe whether or not the transaction was accepted"
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to establish a peer-to-peer connection with the victim node.",
          "The attacker needs to be able to craft and send future or latent invalid transactions with specific gas prices.",
          "An attacker needs to be able to perform RPC calls to the victim nodes."
