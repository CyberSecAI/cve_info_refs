- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The functionality to load a cover via URL is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability to make requests to internal resources or external services from the server hosting BookWyrm.
- **Attack vectors:** A logged-in user can provide a malicious URL when loading a cover, which is then processed by the BookWyrm server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a logged-in user of the BookWyrm instance.
