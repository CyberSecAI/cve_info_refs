Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `Rails::Html::Sanitizer` handles allowed tags when they are overridden by the application developer. Specifically, if both "math" and "style" elements, or both "svg" and "style" elements, are allowed, it creates a potential path for XSS attacks. This is because the sanitizer does not properly neutralize malicious content when these specific tag combinations are permitted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79):** The core issue is that the sanitizer fails to adequately sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious script to be injected into the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by other users. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting HTML containing specific tag combinations ("math" and "style", or "svg" and "style") when the application has overridden the default allowed tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the application that will be processed by the vulnerable `Rails::Html::Sanitizer` with the specific tag override configurations enabled.
*   The attacker does not need a privileged position on the server, but can perform the attack through regular user inputs that are sanitized.

**More Details Than CVE Description:**

The provided content offers more detail than a basic CVE description, including:

*   Specific code examples demonstrating how the vulnerable configurations are set.
*   The different ways in which application developers might override the default allowed tags (application config, sanitize helper, SafeListSanitizer class method, SafeListSanitizer instance method).
*   Workarounds are explicitly suggested: Remove either "style" or both "math" and "svg" from the overridden allowed tags.
*   The vulnerability has been reported by Dominic Breuker.
*   The provided content also lists CVE-2022-23517, CVE-2022-23518 and CVE-2022-23520, which are related vulnerabilities discovered within the same package.
