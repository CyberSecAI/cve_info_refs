# Possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer

Moderate

[flavorjones](/flavorjones)
published
GHSA-9h9g-93gc-623h
Dec 13, 2022

## Package

bundler

rails-html-sanitizer
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 1.4.4

## Patched versions

1.4.4

## Description

## Summary

There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer.

* Versions affected: ALL
* Not affected: NONE
* Fixed versions: 1.4.4

## Impact

A possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in either of the following ways:

* allow both "math" and "style" elements,
* or allow both "svg" and "style" elements

Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden. Applications may be doing this in four different ways:

1. using application configuration:

```
# In config/application.rb
config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["math", "style"]
# or
config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["svg", "style"]
```

see <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-view>

2. using a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:

```
<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["math", "style"] %>
<%# or %>
<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["svg", "style"] %>

```

see <https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize>

3. using Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer class method `allowed_tags=`:

```
# class-level option
Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["math", "style"]
# or
Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["svg", "style"]
```

4. using a `:tags` options to the Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer instance method `sanitize`:

```
# instance-level option
Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["math", "style"])
# or
Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["svg", "style"])
```

All users overriding the allowed tags by any of the above mechanisms to include (("math" or "svg") and "style") should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

## Workarounds

Remove "style" from the overridden allowed tags, or remove "math" and "svg" from the overridden allowed tags.

CVE ID         : CVE-2022-23517 CVE-2022-23518 CVE-2022-23519 CVE-2022-23520
Debian Bug     : 1027153

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Rails HTML Sanitizers, an
HTML sanitization library for Ruby on Rails applications. An attacker
could launch cross-site scripting (XSS) and denial-of-service (DoS)
attacks through crafted HTML/XML documents.

CVE-2022-23517

    Certain configurations use an inefficient regular expression that
    is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to
    sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of
    service through CPU resource consumption.

CVE-2022-23518

    Cross-site scripting via data URIs when used in combination with
    Loofah >= 2.1.0.

CVE-2022-23519

    XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
    Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if
    the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed
    tags in either of the following ways: allow both "math" and
    "style" elements, or allow both "svg" and "style" elements.

CVE-2022-23520

    XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
    Rails::Html::Sanitizer due to an incomplete fix of
    CVE-2022-32209. Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to
    inject content if the application developer has overridden the
    sanitizer's allowed tags to allow both "select" and "style"
    elements.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.4-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-rails-html-sanitizer packages.
