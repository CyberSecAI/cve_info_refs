## Description

phpIPAM **v1.4.4** allows an authenticated admin user to inject
persistent javascript code inside the "Site title" parameter while updating
the site settings. The "Site title" setting is injected in several
locations which triggers the XSS.

## Proof of Concept

Steps to reproduce:

XSS:

1. Go to `"http://192.168.1.5/phpipam/index.php?page=administration&section=settings"`.
2. Update the "Site Title" parameter with `" autofocus onfocus=alert(1)>`.
3. Click on 'Save'.
4. If a user visits the settings page the javascript code will be rendered.

Open redirect:

1. Go to `"http://192.168.1.5/phpipam/index.php?page=administration&section=settings"`.
2. Update the "Site Title" parameter with `0;url=https://google.com" http-equiv="refresh"`.
3. Click on 'Save'.
4. If a user reloads the page, they will be redirected to `https://google.com`.

System Information

* Version: phpIPAM IP address management v1.4.4.
* Operating System: Linux.
* Web Server: Apache
* PHP Version: 7.4
* Database and version: Mysql

## Exploit
