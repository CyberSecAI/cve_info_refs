This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Validate `proto.dtype()` before calling `set_dtype()`.

```
This prevents a `DCHECK`-fail when the proto contains an invalid dtype for a tensor shape with 0 elements or for an incomplete tensor shape.

# `CHECK`-fail when decoding invalid tensors from proto

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-j3mj-fhpq-qqjj
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

When decoding a tensor from protobuf, a TensorFlow process can encounter cases where a `CHECK` assertion is invalidated based on user controlled arguments, if the tensors have an invalid `dtype` and 0 elements or an invalid shape. This allows attackers to cause denial of services in TensorFlow processes.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5b491cd5e41ad63735161cec9c2a568172c8b6a3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5b491cd5e41ad63735161cec9c2a568172c8b6a3).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23571

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
