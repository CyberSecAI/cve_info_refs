Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the Cortex Alertmanager service improperly handling and parsing Alertmanager configurations provided through the "Set Alertmanager Configuration API." Specifically, the parsing process allows for the inclusion of local file paths via the `api_key_file` setting within the `opsgenie_configs` section and `opsgenie_api_key_file` in the `global` section of the configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The core vulnerability is an LFI, where an attacker can supply a malicious Alertmanager configuration that includes a path to a local file. The vulnerable code then reads and potentially exposes the contents of that file.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper validation of the input configuration, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to read local files on the server where the Cortex Alertmanager service is running. This could expose sensitive information such as configuration files, private keys, or any other files accessible by the Cortex process.
    
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is launched over the network by sending a crafted request to the Alertmanager Set Configuration API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Cortex service and the Alertmanager Set Configuration API endpoint.
*   **Cortex Alertmanager API Access:** The attacker must have the ability to submit configurations to the Alertmanager Set Configuration API. This often implies the attacker has to be an authenticated user with the right privileges to do so. It should be noted that the advisory states "Only users of the Cortex Alertmanager service using `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` or `enable_api: true` are affected."
*   **Crafted Configuration:** The attacker must be able to craft an Alertmanager configuration containing the malicious file path within the `api_key_file` or `opsgenie_api_key_file` settings.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cortex versions v1.13.0, v1.13.1, and v1.14.0.
*   Patched versions are 1.13.2 and 1.14.1
*   The vulnerability is present in the `github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pkg/alertmanager` Go package.
*   A workaround includes rejecting Alertmanager configurations containing the `api_key_file` or `opsgenie_api_key_file` settings.
*  The exploit can be triggered by using the Set Alertmanager configuration API: `POST /api/v1/alerts`
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Moderate" severity, with a CVSS score of 6.5.
*   The affected component is the Cortex Alertmanager which is enabled by using the flag  `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` or `enable_api: true`
