Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of **CVE-2022-23464**:

**CVE-2022-23464** is related to a **SpEL Injection vulnerability** in the `Nepxion/Discovery` project, specifically in the `discovery-commons` module.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `StandardEvaluationContext` to evaluate user-controlled expressions, allowing access to Java classes and methods, including those related to runtime execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SpEL Injection:** The `DiscoveryExpressionResolver.eval` method directly evaluates user-provided input (`expression`) using `StandardEvaluationContext`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SpEL expressions that can execute arbitrary Java code.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-provided expressions before evaluating them. Specifically, the `expression` parameter of the `/strategy/validate-expression` endpoint flows directly to the vulnerable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the application is running. The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to execute system commands using `java.lang.Runtime`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/strategy/validate-expression` endpoint with a malicious SpEL expression within the `expression` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the provided content, however, it might be required depending on the application's security configuration.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code path is:
    1.  `StrategyEndpoint.validateExpression` receives the `expression` parameter.
    2.  `StrategyResource.validateExpression` passes the parameter to `DiscoveryExpressionResolver.eval`.
    3.  `DiscoveryExpressionResolver.eval` evaluates the expression using `StandardEvaluationContext`.
- The proof-of-concept (POC) uses the following SpEL expression to execute system command: `T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('touch /tmp/vulnz')`

**Remediation:**
- The recommendation is to replace `StandardEvaluationContext` with `SimpleEvaluationContext`. The `SimpleEvaluationContext` restricts access to Java types, constructors and bean references, thereby preventing the SpEL injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided document also mentions **CVE-2022-23463** and a separate potential SSRF vulnerability, which are not related to the current CVE.
