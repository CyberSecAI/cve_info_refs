Exploit code has also been released for flaws that supposedly date back to 2016

![Researcher discloses alleged zero-day vulnerabilities in NUUO NVRmini2 recording device](/cms/images/6a/4e/187f-article-220114-nuuo-main.jpg "Image: ffriend studio")

A critical ‘zero-day’ vulnerability in network video recording equipment made by NUUO has been made public, as a researcher claims unpatched issues could lead to [remote code execution](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/rce) (RCE).

Discovered by [Agile Information Security founder Pedro Ribeiro](https://agileinfosec.co.uk/), the issues have allegedly been present in the NUUO NVRmini2 device since 2016.

NVRmini2 is a network video recorder (NVR) from Taiwanese vendor NUU that is able to record and store security footage in a digital format.

Ribeiro [claims he disclosed](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/NUUO/nuuo-nvr-vulns.txt) [command injection](/web-security/os-command-injection) and stack overflow vulnerabilities in NVRmini2 six years ago. At the time, Ribeiro said that the product had “terrible security” – and if his claims are true, then nothing has changed for the better.

“Both vulnerabilities disclosed were found during my 2016 audit,” Ribeiro told The Daily Swig. “However, at the time, I found so many other vulnerabilities that I actually forgot to report these – until in 2019 when I rediscovered my notes and reported it to them.”

### Unpatched issues

As [documented on GitHub](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/NUUO/nuuo_nvrmini_round2.mkd#2-busybox-%60tar%60-directory-traversal), there are apparently two unpatched vulnerabilities. The first, yet to be assigned a CVE but considered critical, is a missing authentication method on a critical function in NVRmini2 firmware.

The handle\_import\_user.php function for every firmware version up to and including the latest build lacks adequate protections to stop unauthenticated users from accessing the script, claims Ribeiro.

The second alleged vulnerability is the use of a legacy version of BusyBox, a Unix utilities package. This version is impacted by a range of bugs including [CVE-2011-5325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-5325), a [path traversal](/web-security/file-path-traversal) flaw that allows remote attackers to point to files outside of the current, working directory.

By abusing the HTTP POST mechanism and crafting malicious tar archives, it is possible to chain the vulnerabilities in order to drop a webshell and execute commands as root, says Ribeiro.

In addition to the disclosure, the researcher has released a Metasploit module which packages up the vulnerability chain described in the advisory.

The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code is said to work on most firmware versions with the exception of those older than version 2.0.0 – although alternative techniques can be used on legacy software versions.

At the time of writing, the vulnerabilities remain unpatched on the latest firmware version, v.03.11.0000.0016, despite the researcher claiming he made multiple attempts to disclose them. No official fix is available.

### Mitigating risks

The researcher recommends that NVRmini2 device owners keep their products away from untrusted [networks](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/network-security) as a way to mitigate the risk of exploitation.

Aside from that, using Ribeiro’s own exploit and deleting the handle\_import.user.php function may fix the issue, but this is not guaranteed.

“During the disclosure process, even after multiple attempts, they didn’t really seem to understand the vulnerability,” Ribeiro commented.

“We explained it to them several times, and they seemed completely clueless. They were quite nice and pleasant to deal with it in terms of manners and how they treated us, but technically clueless.”

The Daily Swig has reached out to NUUO for comment but has not heard back at the time of publication. We will update this article as and when we hear back.

### @pedrib **[pedrib](/pedrib)** commented [Jan 12, 2022](#issue-1100457820)

This module exploits two vulnerabilities in NUUO's NVRmini2 NVR device.

It allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution as root, and works on all firmwares ever released.

[More information in my advisory](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/NUUO/nuuo_nvrmini_round2.mkd)

| If this were converted over to deliver an ARCH\_PHP payload we may be able to avoid the need for the HTTP server interactions In this pattern you'd deliver the ARCH\_PHP payload and simply request it to start it's execution and a handler would pick it up. If you were to use the php/exec payload it could also take a command that would be in the results of triggering the payload  You can check out an example of this here: <https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/thinkphp_rce.rb#L223> |

This is the same as our general policy of not allowing arbitrary binaries that we can't compile ourselves into Metasploit Framework.  Once we have a way to generate this binary blob we will be happy to move this forwards. If you have more questions on this [@smcintyre-r7](https://github.com/smcintyre-r7) will likely be able to assist you, I'm just relaying on the info he gave me when we had a chat about this. |

| I wonder - if we could just document the steps for manually encrypt files ourselves - if that would be enough to unblock this PR? i.e. We don't need to verify the decryption is valid - just that we get the expected encrypted file that we're after for RCE?  Just as a sanity question - is the encryption method the same for all devices? i.e. I assume the same encrypted payload works across different devices as well? 😄 |

| [@adfoster-r7](https://github.com/adfoster-r7) you can check the exact steps in the advisory: <https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/NUUO/nuuo_nvrmini_round2.mkd> The steps are reproducible with firmware emulation if you don't have the device, but of course having it makes everything much easier.  Regarding your question about the device, it most definitely will work on any device, since there is no device dependant encryption, the encryption is done in the firmware (which is not customised per device).  I did confirm that it works across different firmware versions, but would be good to get someone else to confirm too if you have access to the device? |

| Hi all,  I'm on the verge of just atticing this PR. We will ultimately need to make the binary blob ourselves. We could go in and try `gdbserver` this but then that raises the question of how maintainable this will be in the long run. We currently don't have access to the device. I do not forsee this changing anytime in the future unfortunately unless one of our team members personally wants to acquire one of these devices.  A second concern is that the info at <https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/NUUO/nuuo_nvrmini_round2.mkd> seems to be behind a GPLv3 license which is incompatible with Metasploit and is not something we can accept. This comes from legal which mentioned that GPLv3 is not something we can legally accept for Metasploit right now. GPLv2 is acceptable and LGPL is acceptable however, as are other common licenses such as MIT, so if you wanted to relicense the research to one of these, this would be acceptable.  I was trying to download the firmware but its behind a login page and it seems their backend can't authenticate to send the emails out. Either that or it really hates temp emails 😅 I can give that another shot though later and hopefully that is fixed; just hope they haven't borked their download servers. |

| [@gwillcox-r7](https://github.com/gwillcox-r7) please don't ax it! I just need a bit of time, but I will come back to it...  You don't need the device, the firmware can be easily emulated, I can put the steps here. I can also provide you with the firmware.  Regarding the GPLv3, I don't think that's a problem... I've submitted over 50 modules to msf before, and they are all based off GPLv3 advisories... first of all the advisory is not an essential part of the module; secondly I am the creator of this module and of the advisory, so I don't see how that could be a problem. |

| [@pedrib](https://github.com/pedrib) Thanks, after speaking with the team I think so long as the binary blobs and module itself are licensed under MSF\_LICENSE we should be fine there; my concern was mainly that the binary blobs were GPLv3 licensed that you had created and included in the module itself. I'll await your updates so long 👍 Keep in mind that if we do attic this we can always reopen it once the updates are applied; atticing simply will mean that the PR is marked as closed but can be reopened once the appropriate updates are applied. |

| I'm going to attic this PR as this has been open for a year and a half now with no noticeable updates, and its been nearly 6 months since the last request. This is 3 times the normal amount of time we give people for updates. Whilst we are happy to reopen this once the work has been done, we need to keep the PR queue clean so it reflects work that is actively being worked on. Once this PR is updated appropriately we can look at reopening this PR and moving it forwards. |

| Thanks for your contribution to Metasploit Framework! We've looked at this pull request, and we agree that it seems like a good addition to Metasploit, but it looks like it is not quite ready to land. We've labeled it `attic` and closed it for now.  What does this generally mean? It could be one or more of several things:   * It doesn't look like there has been any activity on this pull request in a while * We may not have the proper access or equipment to test this pull request, or the contributor doesn't have time to work on it right now. * Sometimes the implementation isn't quite right and a different approach is necessary.   We would love to land this pull request when it's ready. If you have a chance to address all comments, we would be happy to reopen and discuss how to merge this! |

## Summary

NUUO's [NVRmini2](https://nuuo.com/ProductNode.php?node=2) is a Network Video Recorder (NVR) produced by [NUUO Inc.](https://nuuo.com)
As with most NVR, it has terrible security and has been hacked multiple times, the [very first one by me](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Aug/36) back in 2016 with [command injections and a stack overflow](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/NUUO/nuuo-nvr-vulns.txt).

Six years later, it's time to pwn it again, by abusing an insecure user update mechanism and a very old path traversal vulnerability to execute code as root! This vulnerability has been reported to NUUO *multiple times* and despite their attempted fixes, it's still an `0day` at the time of writing, so have fun!

A Metasploit module that abuses this chain of vulnerabilities has been released, and it is [available here](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/exploits/metasploit/nuuo_nvrmini_unauth_rce_r2.rb) and [here](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/16044).

### Disclosure Process

This chain of vulnerabilities was first discovered during my [original 2016 audit](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/NUUO/nuuo-nvr-vulns.txt), but I actually forgot about them (honestly, I did forget... rare but happens). I re-discovered them by reading my notes in mid 2019 and they were disclosed to NUUO.

A new firmware version was released in March 2020 (version `03.11.0000.0005`) and the bugs were not fixed, so they were reported AGAIN in April 2020. Since then, firmware [version 03.11.0000.0016](https://nuuo.com/DownloadDetail.php?id=0118) was released and the bugs are STILL not fixed.

I guess it's time to disclose them, even if there's no patch?

All binaries and binary offsets mentioned in this advisory are from version `03.11.0000.0005`.

## Vulnerability Details

### #1: Missing Authentication on `handle_import_user.php`

* [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)
* [CVE-2022-23227](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23227)
* Risk Classification: Critical
* Attack Vector: Remote
* Constraints: None
* Affected versions: every publicly released firmware version up to and including version 03.11.0000.0016

The file `/NUUO/web/handle_import_user.php` is accessible at `http://TARGET/handle_import_user.php` by an unauthenticated user.
Its contents are as follows:

```
<?php
include('utils.php');

$file_name = "user".rand().".cfg";
$file_path = "/tmp/";

if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload_file']['tmp_name'], $file_path.$file_name)) {
    echo 'user import over';
    system(constant("NUUO_BASE_FOLDER")."/bin/cgi_system importuser 'bfolder=".$file_path."&bfile=".$file_name."'");
} else{
    echo "There was an error uploading the file, please try again!";
}

unlink($file_path.$file_name);
?>
```

As it can be seen in the snippet above, it simply copies a file uploaded via an HTTP form POST to `/tmp/userRAND.cfg`, where `RAND` is a random number, and then calls `/bin/cgi_system importuser bfolder=/tmp/ bfile=userRAND.cfg`.

`cgi_system` is a complex binary, and to keep this advisory short and sweet I decided not to show any of the disassembled or decompiled code.
If you would like to have a look at it, in the latest firmware version 03.11.0000.0016 the function that performs the user import is located at offset `0x2B990` (md5sum `56e2df9ad0ea0d5b74772bc45b1c81d7`).

This function does the following:

* Reads the file
* Attempts to decrypt it
* Untars it
* Reads the untarred files (`shadow` and `passwd`)
* Attempts to add any users in the previously mentioned files to `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

Only users with `UID` 1000 or above are processed, any other users are ignored.

The encryption appears to be custom, and I avoid reversing custom encryption mechanisms unless it's absolutely necessary (it's fun, but requires lots of time).
Like all true hackers, we want to achieve success through the easiest route - the path of least resistance (however, if you want to reverse the encryption, I'd be very curious to know their algorithm).

So let's use some trickery instead to get what we want!

1. Downgrade the firmware to version 3.0.0
2. Create a new "power user" named `pwner` with the password `pwned` in the web interface
3. Use my [Metasploit module from 2016](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/http/nuuo_nvrmini_unauth_rce.rb) to get a root shell
4. Change `pwner`'s `passwd` shell to `/bin/bash`
5. Run `/NUUO/bin/cgi_system exportuser 'bfile=stuff' > /tmp/ble.cfg` in the root shell
6. Exfiltrate the `/tmp/ble.cfg` file (using `nc` for example) and remove the HTTP junk at the start
7. You can now upload this file to ANY other NVRmini2 (with any firmware version) with `http://TARGET/handle_import_user.php`
8. ... and login to TARGET as `pwner:pwned` over SSH to get a shell!

OK this is nice... but we still need to get root. Time to look for a privilege escalation?

### #2: BusyBox `tar` Directory Traversal

* [CWE-35: Path Traversal](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/35.html)
* [CVE-2011-5325](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5325)
* Risk Classification: High
* Attack Vector: Local
* Constraints: N/A
* Affected versions: every publicly released firmware version up to and including version 03.11.0000.0016

The NVRmini2 uses a very old `busybox` version, something that is common amongst IoT devices.
The latest firmware version 03.11.0000.0016 uses `BusyBox v1.16.1 (2013-11-12 15:35:46 CST) multi-call binary`.

This version is affected by many vulnerabilities, one of them being [CVE-2011-5325](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5325), a directory traversal when unpacking `tar` archives. For more details please check this [commit message](https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=a116552869db5e7793ae10968eb3c962c69b3d8c). The following section also explains how to create a malicious tar.

How can we combine these two vulnerabilities?

## Exploit Chain

By now an astute reader will remember that the user import function located at offset `0x2B990` in the `cgi_system` binary has to perform a series of steps, including untar'ing the file provided in the HTTP POST, after it is decrypted.

Let's abuse this mechanism. First we create our malicious `tar` file with our webshell `shelly.php`:

```
echo haha > owned
tar cfv sploit.tar owned
ln -s /NUUO/web/ nuuo
tar --append -f sploit.tar nuuo
rm nuuo
mkdir nuuo
cp shelly.php nuuo/
tar --append -f sploit.tar nuuo/shelly.php
gzip sploit.tar
```
> Snippet #1: Creating a malicious tar file

However, if you recall from previous sections, we have to encrypt this file (it is first decrypted before it is untar'ed), and I was too lazy to reverse the encryption. The last step (`gzip`) is necessary because the handler expects a zipped file.

This is easily solvable by following the previously described steps to obtain a root shell on the target. We then start `gdbserver` (which is helpfully included in the target) with:

`gdbserver :3333 /NUUO/bin/cgi_system exportuser 'bfile=stuff'`

We connect our remote debugger and set a breakpoint at offset `0x2AF5C`:

```
fd_w = fopen(cfg_file, "r");
```

This is the point in the `exportuser` handler that opens a file for encryption. We run the program and then when it breaks we go to the `/tmp/tmpXXXX` directory (XXXX is the program's `PID`).
In this directory there will be a `_stuff.tgz` file and we will overwrite it with the contents of the file created in Snippet #1 above.

We then set a breakpoint at offset `0x2ADBC`:

```
remove(encrypted_file);
```

At this point, we copy `/tmp/stuff.cfg` to `/tmp/whatever` and we can then continue the program and exit the debugger.

The `/tmp/whatever` file will now be encrypted with a malicious `tar` inside that can be used to pwn any firmware version, and we exfiltrate it back to our computer.

We upload this file to `http://TARGET/handle_import_user.php` in an HTTP POST form, the file is decrypted, and then when it is untar'ed we abuse [CVE-2011-5325](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5325) to perform path traversal and drop a web shell on `/NUUO/web/shelly.php`, which will execute as root!

### Metasploit Module

I am releasing a [new Metasploit](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/exploits/metasploit/nuuo_nvrmini_unauth_rce_r2.rb) [module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/16044) that packages the whole exploit chain described in this advisory.
The exploit works in virtually all firmware versions ever released (see sub section below for caveat)!

A typical run of the exploit looks like this:

```

### Notes on Older Versions

The technique used to drop a web shell does not work on firmware versions older than 2.0.0.
For these very old versions, an alternative technique can be used, which is also provided in the [new Metasploit](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/exploits/metasploit/nuuo_nvrmini_unauth_rce_r2.rb) [module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/16044) released with this advisory.

This technique consists of replacing the `shadow` file with one that contains a user that can login via SSH to the target. Why doesn't the web shell technique work on versions older than 2.0.0? That's a good question.

I had this in my notes from 2019, but I didn't provide any details to myself and I don't want to spend any more time researching this old bug.
If you're interested, try to understand why and drop me a note, I'd be very curious to know!

In any case, for older firmware versions I recommend you use my [Metasploit module from 2016](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/http/nuuo_nvrmini_unauth_rce.rb), which works flawlessly on VERY OLD firmware versions all the way up to 3.0.0.

## Fixes / Mitigations

Unfortunately the vendor did not respond to any of the disclosure attempts, and failed to resolve this vulnerability multiple times, so there is no fix. DO NOT expose any NVRmini2 devices to untrusted networks.
