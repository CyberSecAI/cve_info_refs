- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A parsing issue in the upstream `masterminds/html5` package. This issue arises when malicious markup is used in a sequence with special HTML CDATA sections, which the sanitizer fails to filter. Additionally, `masterminds/html5` provides HTML raw text elements as DOMText nodes, which were not further processed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the bypass of the cross-site scripting (XSS) protection mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer` due to improper parsing of specific HTML structures and lack of sanitization for raw text elements.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other security compromises, typical of XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to inject malicious HTML markup. User interaction (victim clicking on a malicious link or content) is required. The attacker does not need privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
