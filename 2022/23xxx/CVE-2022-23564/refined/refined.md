Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a `CHECK` assertion failure during the decoding of resource handle tensors from a protobuf. Specifically, a tensor might contain too many elements (overflow), causing the check to fail. This occurs when the input proto contains more elements than expected by the receiving code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of the number of elements in the resource handle tensor during deserialization from a protobuf. This lack of validation can lead to an overflow condition which triggers the `CHECK` failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS). By providing a specially crafted protobuf with an oversized resource handle tensor, an attacker can trigger the `CHECK` failure, causing the TensorFlow process to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a maliciously crafted protobuf containing a resource handle tensor with an excessive number of elements.
- This protobuf is then used as input to the TensorFlow process which attempts to deserialize the tensor, which will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a malformed protobuf to a TensorFlow process that deserializes it. This implies a position where the attacker can influence the input data to the vulnerable TensorFlow instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix addresses the vulnerability by using `BuildResourceHandle` function which validates the shape before parsing resource handles from proto.
- This issue was addressed in the commit `14fea662350e7c26eb5fe1be2ac31704e5682ee6` by preventing the `CHECK`-fail.
- The vulnerability was present in TensorFlow versions before 2.8.0, and patched in 2.5.3, 2.6.3, and 2.7.1.
- The commit message for the fix states "In certain scenarios, the proto might contain tensors that have too many elements (overflow). This is a `CHECK`-fail in general, but we should prevent this, given how many CVEs caused by that we have received this year (a large fraction of 200)."
