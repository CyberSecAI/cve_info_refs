Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `check_mounted()` function in `secure_mount.py` incorrectly parses the output of the `mount` command to verify if a secure tmpfs is mounted at `/var/lib/keylime/secure`. This function can be fooled by unprivileged users creating mount entries using tools like `fusermount`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Parsing of Mount Information:** The `check_mounted()` function relies on parsing the output of the `mount` command, which is prone to errors due to variations in whitespace and formatting.
*   **Bypass of Security Feature:** By creating a fake mount entry, an attacker can trick the `check_mounted()` function into believing that the secure tmpfs is already mounted, even when it is not. This bypasses the intended security measure.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation (potential):** If the attacker can create such a mount entry before the `keylime_agent` starts, they can prevent the secure tmpfs from being created which may lead to sensitive information being exposed.
*   **Local Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause an exception and prevent `keylime_agent` from starting by claiming a different `fsname` than tmpfs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** If the secure tmpfs is not mounted correctly, sensitive data intended to be stored in memory only might be written to disk, potentially exposing it to unauthorized users.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By creating a mount with an incorrect `fsname` or by occupying the mount point, a local attacker can prevent the `keylime_agent` service from starting.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** A local user with the ability to run `fusermount` or similar mounting tools can create a malicious mount entry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the `keylime_agent` is running.
*   **Ability to Mount Filesystems:** The attacker needs to be able to use tools to create mount entries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered because the `check_mounted` function parses the output of the `mount` command, which can be manipulated by an unprivileged user. The fix involves parsing `/proc/self/mountinfo` instead, which provides more reliable mount information.
* The fix also addresses the lack of unmounting of the temporary file system when the agent exits, as well as ensuring that the secure file system is mounted before keylime uses it.
*   The advisory ([https://github.com/keylime/keylime/security/advisories/GHSA-wj36-qcfg-5j52](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/security/advisories/GHSA-wj36-qcfg-5j52)) provides more detail, stating that the mount logic could be fooled and leak sensitive data, and links to the commits that fix this issue.

This CVE is related to a flaw in how Keylime verifies the secure mount, allowing a local attacker to bypass this security measure, potentially leading to information leaks or DoS.
