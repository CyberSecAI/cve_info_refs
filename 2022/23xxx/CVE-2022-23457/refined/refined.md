        "root_cause": "The `getValidDirectoryPath` method in ESAPI's `DefaultValidator` class does not properly validate if a given directory is within a specified parent directory. The vulnerability stems from the use of `startsWith` on canonical paths where the parent directory's canonical path may not have a trailing slash and cause a bypass.",

        "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the input string representing the path, an attacker can bypass validation performed by the `getValidDirectoryPath` method and specify a directory outside of the intended scope.",
