Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-23818:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation on the model specific register: VM_HSAVE_PA.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of the model specific register.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential loss of SEV-SNP guest memory integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV-SNP) environment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have some level of access to the system such that they could manipulate the VM_HSAVE_PA register. This likely requires some level of privilege within the guest VM or potentially a compromised hypervisor.

**Additional details:**
- The document notes that this vulnerability is specific to systems using Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), indicating that not all SEV implementations are affected.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity by AMD.
- Mitigation is provided through updated AGESA firmware versions for 3rd Gen AMD EPYC Processors (MilanPI 1.0.0.9)
- It was reported internally to AMD.
