### CVE-2022-23072
**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when rendering food names in the "Add to Cart" functionality, specifically when a user adds a new food item with a malicious JavaScript payload within the 'Name' parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to improper input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation**:
A low-privileged attacker can inject malicious JavaScript, which when executed by a victim (including an administrator), can lead to session hijacking and potentially full account takeover, as the attacker can steal the victim's API key.

**Attack vectors**:
The attack vector is the "Add to Cart" functionality, where the 'Name' field of a food item allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user of the application and be able to access the food list page to add a new food item. Additionally, the attacker needs to host a separate server to receive the stolen API key.
