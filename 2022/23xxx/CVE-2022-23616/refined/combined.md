#### Description

### Issue

When resetting the password, the user document XWiki.<username> is saved as superadmin.

By creating a macro on the user document before resetting the document, it will be executed with superadmin privileges. Thus it is possible to run, for example, a groovy script as a normal user.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create an unprivileged user.
2. Add a XWiki.WikiMacroClass object with a groovy script.
3. Do a password reset request for this user.
4. Use the macro in any document.

Many variants can be used depending on how the user profile is configured.

Other types of objects can also be used to hold the script.

# Remote code execution in user profiles with reset password

High

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-mgjw-2wrp-r535
Feb 9, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-administration-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 3.1M1

## Patched versions

13.1RC1

## Description

### Impact

It's possible for an unprivileged user to perform a remote code execution by injecting a groovy script in her own profile and by calling the Reset password feature since the feature is performing a save of the user profile with programming rights in the impacted versions of XWiki.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.1RC1 with a complete refactoring of the Reset password feature.

### Workarounds

There's different possible workarounds, all consisting in modifying the XWiki/ResetPassword page.

* the Reset password feature can be entirely disabled by deleting the XWiki/ResetPassword page
* the script in XWiki/ResetPassword can also be modified or removed: an administrator can replace it with a simple email contact to ask an administrator to reset the password.
