Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23616

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way XWiki handles password resets. When a user requests a password reset, the system saves the user's document (XWiki.<username>) as a superadmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Privilege Management:** Saving the user document with superadmin privileges during a password reset is the core vulnerability.
- **Code Injection:** A malicious, unprivileged user can inject a malicious script into their user profile by creating a `XWiki.WikiMacroClass` object (or similar objects) containing a script.
- **Unintended Script Execution:**  The injected script is executed with superadmin privileges when the user's document is saved during a password reset.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A normal user can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting a malicious script, leading to full system compromise.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  An unprivileged user gains superadmin level access through the RCE vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Create an Unprivileged User:** An attacker creates a normal, non-privileged user account.
2. **Inject Malicious Script:** The attacker adds a `XWiki.WikiMacroClass` object (or similar) to their user document (XWiki.<username>) containing a malicious script (e.g., Groovy script).
3. **Password Reset Request:** The attacker initiates a password reset request for their user account. This triggers the vulnerable code path and saves the user's document as a superadmin.
4. **Execute the Payload:** The attacker can trigger the execution of the injected code by using the macro in any document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have an account on the XWiki platform with user-level privileges.
- The ability to create and modify objects (specifically the user profile object) in XWiki as an unprivileged user.
- Knowledge of how to exploit user objects to execute code, such as using `XWiki.WikiMacroClass`.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in XWiki versions 10.11.9, 11.3.3, and 11.6.1.
- It was fixed in version 13.1RC1 through a refactoring of the reset password feature.
- Workarounds include disabling the reset password functionality or modifying the `XWiki/ResetPassword` page to avoid the vulnerable code path.
- The provided Github security advisory ([https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-mgjw-2wrp-r535](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-mgjw-2wrp-r535)) confirms the vulnerability and its resolution.
