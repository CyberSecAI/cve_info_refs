  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not validate URLs used for redirection, specifically via the 'xredirect' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Open Redirect vulnerability (CWE-601). The application allows a user-controlled URL in the 'xredirect' parameter to redirect to an arbitrary external site without proper validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can redirect users to a malicious site, potentially for phishing or other malicious purposes. This could lead to users unknowingly providing sensitive information to the attacker or installing malware.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a URL with the 'xredirect' parameter pointing to a malicious domain. The user is then tricked into clicking the crafted URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to click a specially crafted URL."
