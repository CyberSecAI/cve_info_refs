Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `\App\Manage\Controller\BannerController.class.php` file of the tuzicms project.
*   The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query, specifically within the `save()` function after an id is provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code directly uses user-provided input within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration (stealing sensitive information).
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data).
    *   Complete compromise of the database server (in some cases).
*   In this specific example, the provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can use the SQL injection to obtain the database username.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker uses a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Malicious Payloads:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the request parameters (likely in an id parameter) that are used in the SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the application and intercept/modify the requests.
*   The attacker doesn't require any specific prior authentication, just the ability to reach the vulnerable endpoint.
*   Basic understanding of SQL syntax is required to construct the malicious payloads.

**Additional Details**

* The provided Github issue includes images showing the steps to reproduce the vulnerability and the vulnerable source code.
* A PoC is provided demonstrating how to extract the database user.
* The fix suggestion is to filter the id before calling the `save()` function.
