## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2022-08-24: Reported to Anton Adamansky, the lead maintainer
* 2022-08-25: Issue has been addressed with [commit](https://github.com/Softmotions/iowow/commit/a79d31e4cff1d5a08f665574b29fd885897a28fd)
* 2022-08-27: Maintainer has delayed response to requests for security advisory.
* 2022-09-06: Assigned CVE-2022-23462

## Summary

There is a stack buffer overflow present in iowow that allows for Denial of Service (DOS) when it parses scientific notation numbers present in JSON.

## Product

iowow

## Tested Version

Latest

## Details

### Issue: stack buffer overflow in `iwjson.c` (`GHSL-2022-066`)

```
void iwjson_ftoa(long double val, char buf[static IWNUMBUF_SIZE], size_t *out_len) {
             int len = snprintf(buf, 64, "%.8Lf", val);

```

`buf` has size `IWNUMBUF_SIZE` (32) but the format string assumes a size of 64 resulting in a stack buffer overflow. This allows for DOS due to a stack canary overwrite. Without a stack canary, instruction pointer can be overwritten with numerical values 0x30 to 0x39.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to Denial of Service (DOS).

## CVE

* CVE-2022-23462
