Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23612

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input (`httpRequest.getPathInfo()`) when handling requests for files under the `/images` or `/initfilter/scripts` paths in the `StartupFilter.java` file. Specifically, the application concatenates the base path with the unsanitized `httpRequest.getPathInfo()` which allows directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `httpRequest.getPathInfo()` before using it to construct the file path. An attacker can inject path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate to arbitrary files on the server.
- **Unprotected File Access:** The application directly accesses and returns the file content specified in the constructed path to the client without proper authorization checks or sanitization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Exfiltration:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the OpenMRS application user has access to. This can expose sensitive data, configuration files, or even potentially executable code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network through HTTP requests.
-  An attacker crafts a GET request with a path containing directory traversal sequences (`../`) within the `httpRequest.getPathInfo()` when requesting `/images` or `/initfilter/scripts`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OpenMRS instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `StartupFilter.java` file, specifically within the `doFilter` method.
- The fix involves normalizing the path with `fullFilePath.normalize()` to remove `../` path traversal sequences and ensure that the resulting path is still within the intended base path.
- The vulnerability is present in OpenMRS versions >= 1.6 and is patched in versions 2.1.5, 2.2.1, 2.3.5, 2.4.5, and 2.5.3.
- Tomcat's URL normalization (in Tomcat 7.0.28+) provides some mitigation for the vulnerability.

**CVSS Score:**
- A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 is provided, indicating a high severity vulnerability with a network attack vector, low attack complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction and high confidentiality impact
