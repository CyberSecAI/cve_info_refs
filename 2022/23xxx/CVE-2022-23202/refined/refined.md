- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element, which can lead to the loading of malicious DLLs or executables.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R), and the attacker does not need privileges (PR:N). The attack complexity is high (AC:H).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to place a malicious file in a location that the application searches before the legitimate file, and also needs to induce a user to trigger the vulnerable application.
