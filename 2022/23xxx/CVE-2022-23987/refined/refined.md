- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WS Form plugin (and WS Form Pro) does not sanitize and escape the Form Name, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of input sanitization and output escaping of the Form Name.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**  An authenticated user with administrator privileges can create a form with a malicious payload embedded in the Form Name. This payload will then be executed when other users view the list of forms or preview the form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least admin privileges. This is necessary to create or edit forms and inject the malicious payload.
