# Denial of service through through repository index file

Moderate

[hickeyma](/hickeyma)
published
GHSA-53c4-hhmh-vw5q
Dec 14, 2022

## Package

gomod

helm.sh/helm/v3
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=v3.10.2

## Patched versions

v3.10.3

## Description

Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the *repo* package that can cause a segmentation violation. Applications that use functions from the *repo* package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.

### Impact

The *repo* package contains a handler that processes the index file of a repository. For example, the Helm client adds references to chart repositories where charts are managed. The *repo* package parses the index file of the repository and loads it into structures Go can work with. Some index files can cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.

Applications that use the *repo* package in the Helm SDK to parse an index file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.

The Helm Client will panic with an index file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.

### Patches

This issue has been resolved in 3.10.3.

### Workarounds

SDK users can validate index files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the *repo* functions.

### For more information

Helm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.

### Credits

Disclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23525

### Weaknesses

[CWE-476](/advisories?query=cwe%3A476)
