- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hard-coded credentials for the CAMS server application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: By sending a malformed packet to the CAMS server using the hard-coded credentials, an attacker can abuse all functions of the CAMS server, including suppressing alarms.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed packet to the CAMS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment (adjacent) as the affected system. The attacker also needs to know/use the hard-coded credentials and be able to send a malformed packet to the CAMS server application. User interaction is required since it is part of the CVSS vector.
