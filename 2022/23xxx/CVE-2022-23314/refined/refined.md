Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `net.mingsoft.mdiy.action.ModelAction#importJson` function of the MCMS application.
- The function processes imported JSON data and extracts a SQL query based on the `modelType` parameter from the provided JSON input, which is then directly executed without sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-controlled data into a SQL query. This occurs because the application retrieves the sql statement from the JSON input and directly executes it without any validation or sanitization of input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `importJson.do` endpoint, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:**  As shown in the provided example, an attacker can create a new super admin user. It is also possible to perform other malicious actions such as extracting the entire database, deleting data or modifying database records.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP request to the `/ms/mdiy/model/importJson.do` endpoint.
- **JSON Payload:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the JSON payload sent in the request, specifically within the part of the JSON that corresponds to the `modelType` parameter, and ultimately the SQL statement.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/ms/mdiy/model/importJson.do`.
- The attacker needs to know how to format the JSON payload with malicious SQL code.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes screenshots showing the vulnerable code and the SQL injection in action.
- The issue was reported on January 10, 2022, and was marked as resolved in milestone 5.2.6
