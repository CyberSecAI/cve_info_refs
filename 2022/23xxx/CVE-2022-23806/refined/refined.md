Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `crypto/elliptic` package of the Go programming language, specifically in the `Curve.IsOnCurve` function. This function is designed to verify if given coordinates represent a valid point on an elliptic curve. However, it incorrectly returns `true` for `big.Int` values that do not represent valid field elements (i.e., negative or overflowing values), which should be considered as meaningless inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Input Validation:** The `IsOnCurve` function fails to properly validate the input `big.Int` coordinates, accepting values that are outside the valid range for field elements, resulting in inconsistent behavior between different implementations of elliptic curves.
*   **Inconsistent Behavior:** Different implementations of `IsOnCurve` have different behaviors when presented with invalid inputs. Some accept the invalid values as long as they reduce to a valid coordinate, some unintentionally return false due to dropping the sign or overflow, and some intentionally return false for overflowing but unintentionally drop the sign for negative values.
*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The crypto/elliptic API lacks error handling when processing invalid `big.Int` values, preventing applications from rejecting these nonsensical inputs. Operations on these invalid values (e.g., ScalarMult) can lead to panics or incorrect cryptographic results.
*   **Invalid Curve Attacks:** Processing invalid points can lead to invalid curve attacks. For example, the P-256 curve could produce off-curve output, which is a security risk that could leak bits of the scalar.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cryptographic Errors:** Invalid curve operations can lead to cryptographic computations that produce incorrect or unreliable results.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, using invalid field elements can cause a panic in the `ScalarMult` operation, causing a DoS.
*   **Information Leakage:**  Invalid curve attacks can potentially leak information related to cryptographic operations, such as bits of the scalar in scalar multiplication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Passing Invalid `big.Int`s as coordinates:** The primary attack vector is to provide crafted `big.Int` values to the `IsOnCurve` function that do not represent valid field elements. This can be achieved through various means, including direct input to crypto operations, or by crafting invalid cryptographic formats that, when parsed, result in invalid coordinates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input coordinates to the `crypto/elliptic` functions that use the vulnerable `IsOnCurve` function, such as `ScalarMult` or functions that depend on `IsOnCurve` implicitly through `Unmarshal`. No special privileges or prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was identified when a user provided a pair of `big.Int` coordinates that passed `IsOnCurve` but then caused a panic in `ScalarMult`.
*   The fix involves modifying `IsOnCurve` to always return `false` for negative and overflowing `big.Int` values.
*   The issue is considered a security vulnerability because it can lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially expose applications to attacks.
*   The fix is released as part of Go versions 1.17.7 and 1.16.14.
*   A separate issue ([#50975](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50975)) is opened to address the behavior of group operations for invalid points in a future Go release.
