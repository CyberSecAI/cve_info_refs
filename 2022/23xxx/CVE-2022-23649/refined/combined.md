* Make sure signature in Rekor bundle matches signature being verified

Signed-off-by: Priya Wadhwa <priya@chainguard.dev>

* Only print "fulcio verified" when using Fulcio

Currently we tell users that we've verified against the Fulcio root
trust when verifying but this isn't always true. This work ensures we
only say this when we actually use the Fulcio root cert for
verification.

Signed-off-by: Nathan Smith <nathan@chainguard.dev>

* Add e2e test

# Cosign can be manipulated to falsely claim an entry exists in the Rekor transparency log

Low

[priyawadhwa](/priyawadhwa)
published
GHSA-ccxc-vr6p-4858
Feb 18, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.5.1

## Patched versions

1.5.2

## Description

### Impact

Cosign can be manipulated to claim that an entry for a signature exists in the Rekor transparency log even if it doesn't. This requires the attacker to have pull and push permissions for the signature in OCI. This can happen with both standard signing with a keypair and "keyless signing" with Fulcio.

#### Signing with a keypair

To reproduce this vulnerability, create a keypair and sign an image. Don't store the signature in Rekor:

```
$ cosign generate-key-pair
$ cosign sign --key cosign.key IMAGE

```

If an attacker has access to the signature in OCI, they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor even though it wasn't. To accomplish this, the attacker needs to:

1. Pull the signature image
2. Annotate the signature image with any valid Rekor bundle under the `dev.sigstore.cosign/bundle` annotation
3. Push the signature image back to OCI

Verification then prints out the following:

```
$ cosign verify [--key]  [IMAGE]

Verification for [IMAGE] --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key
  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.

[…]

```

The claim that `Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline` is inaccurate since an entry for this image doesn't exist in the log.

The claim that `Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.` is technically correct but since there were no certificates that should be explicitly called out.

#### "Keyless signing" with an OIDC flow

To reproduce this vulnerability, sign the image with a Fulcio identity. Don't store the signature in Rekor:

```
$ COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign sign IMAGE
[...]
IMAGE appears to be a private repository, please confirm uploading to the transparency log at "https://rekor.sigstore.dev" [Y/N]: n

```

Then, create a keypair and sign the image again. Store an entry for the signature in Rekor:

```
$ cosign generate-key-pair
$ COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign sign --key cosign.key IMAGE

Enter password for private key: IMAGE appears to be a private repository, please confirm uploading to the transparency log at "https://rekor.sigstore.dev" [Y/N]: y

```

If an attacker has access to the signature in OCI, they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor even though it wasn't. To accomplish this, the attacker needs to:

1. Pull the signature image
2. Copy the rekor bundle from the second signature into the first signature under the `dev.sigstore.cosign/bundle` annotation
3. Push the signature image back to OCI

*Note: For this to work, both signatures must occur during the valid lifespan of the certificate (~20 minutes).*

Verification then prints out the following:

```
$ cosign verify [--key]  [IMAGE]

Verification for [IMAGE] --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key
  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.

[…]

```

The claim that `Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline` is inaccurate since an entry for this image doesn't exist in the log.

The claim that `Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.` is technically correct but since there were no certificates that should be explicitly called out.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in v1.5.2 of cosign.

The `signature` in the `signedEntryTimestamp` provided by Rekor is now compared to the `signature` that is being verified. If these don't match, then an error is returned. If a valid bundle is copied to a different signature, verification should fail.

Cosign output now only informs the user that certificates were verified if a certificate was in fact verified.

### Workarounds

The only workaround is upgrading.
