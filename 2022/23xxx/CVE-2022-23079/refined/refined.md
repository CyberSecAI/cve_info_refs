### CVE-2022-23079
The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-23079.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the host header in the password reset functionality. The application uses the `request.host` to generate the password reset link.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Host header injection: The application uses the host header from the incoming request without sanitization or validation when constructing the password reset link.
- Insecure password reset mechanism: By manipulating the host header an attacker can redirect password reset links to an attacker controlled domain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can send password reset emails with links pointing to an attacker-controlled domain, potentially leading to credential theft, account takeover and/or further attacks.
- By stealing the reset tokens, the attacker can reset arbitrary user passwords.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via network by sending a crafted HTTP request with a manipulated `Host` header to the password reset endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to intercept the password reset request (e.g. using a proxy like Burp Suite).
- No specific user privileges are required; any user who has the ability to initiate password reset functionality is vulnerable.
