Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient session expiration. The Shopizer application does not invalidate or delete active user sessions when a user's password is changed, either by the user or an administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Session Expiration:** Active sessions remain valid even after a password change. This allows a user with an old password to retain access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who knows a user's old password (e.g., from a previous breach) can continue to access the application and perform actions even after the password has been reset by the legitimate user or an admin.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Depending on the compromised account's privileges, this could result in unauthorized viewing of sensitive customer or business data.
- **Integrity Breach:** An attacker can modify data if the compromised account has write privileges.
- **Availability Breach:** An attacker can disrupt services if the compromised account has sufficient privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network access since it involves authentication and session management over HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must know valid, but now outdated, credentials of a user.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Shopizer application.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
