Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-23129:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plaintext storage of a password within the "export to CSV" function of the GENESIS64 and MC Works64 Workbench. Specifically, when exporting the GridWorX Server configuration, the database authentication information (password) is included in plain text within the CSV file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Plaintext Storage of a Password (CWE-256):** The core issue is the storage of sensitive password data in an unencrypted format within the exported CSV file. This exposes the credentials to anyone who can access the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the exported CSV file can obtain the database password in plaintext.
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** With the revealed password, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the linked SQL database. This could lead to further malicious activities like data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Compromise of the control system:** Gaining access to the database could allow for modification of configurations and potentially lead to further compromise of the control system

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The primary attack vector involves a local attacker who can gain access to the exported CSV file.
*  **User Interaction Required:** The export function requires a user to perform the action, but no specific privileges are required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have access to the file system where the CSV export is stored, either through direct access to the system or via some other means (e.g., stolen file, network access, etc)
*   A privileged user (High) is required to perform the export of the config to CSV, however any user with access to the generated file will be able to see the plaintext password.
* The attacker needs to be a user with the capability to export the configuration to a CSV file

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of ICONICS GENESIS64 and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 products
*   Mitigation includes applying security patches, deleting the password information from the CSV file and restricting access to the export function to administrators.
