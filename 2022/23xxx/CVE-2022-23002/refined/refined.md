Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-23002:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- When computing a shared secret or point multiplication on the NIST P-256 curve, if the result has an X coordinate of zero, the output is not properly reduced modulo the P-256 field prime. This results in an invalid output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper output reduction after elliptic curve point multiplication or shared secret computation on the NIST P-256 curve when the resulting X coordinate is zero.
- The generated output is not properly reduced modulo the P-256 field prime.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The invalid, unreduced output can cause errors when used in subsequent operations. This may lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) scenario in applications using the library.
- It can cause an incorrect session key choice in applications, also potentially leading to DoS or other security impacts.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing inputs that result in an X coordinate of zero during shared secret or point multiplication operations on the NIST P-256 curve.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the inputs to the vulnerable cryptographic functions (shared secret or point multiplication) that utilize the Sweet B library. This implies an attacker interacting with or controlling a system or component that utilizes this library and its elliptic curve cryptographic functions.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was identified during improvements to unit testing.
- The fix is available in Sweet B tag "v2" and later revisions.
- The vulnerability is related to the NIST P-256 curve.
- The same unreduced output from the faulty calculations is also involved in another related CVE: CVE-2022-23003
