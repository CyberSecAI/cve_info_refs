Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23043:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient validation of file extensions during the upload process in Zenario CMS 9.2. Specifically, an authenticated administrator can create a new "File/MIME Type" entry with the `.phar` extension, which is not properly blocked, even though the server validates against some malicious extensions. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended file upload restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper filtering or sanitization of file extensions when creating custom file types.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The ability to upload `.phar` files, which can contain PHP code, leads to a remote code execution vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious `.phar` file containing PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** RCE can potentially lead to complete compromise of the affected server and the data it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the Zenario CMS.
*   **File Upload:** The attack vector is the file upload functionality within the administrative panel of the CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Admin Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level credentials to access the CMS's configuration and upload features.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify Request:** An attacker needs to intercept the file upload request to change the file extension to `.phar` if it was not already.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Oscar Uribe from Fluid Attacks.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 9.2.55826 of Zenario CMS.
*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) that details how to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The provided content also notes that an exploit is not publicly available but can be manually exploited.
