The provided content discusses a reported CSRF vulnerability in YzmCMS V6.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of CSRF protection in the comment submission functionality of the YzmCMS V6.3 frontend.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform actions they did not intend to, such as posting comments on articles. In the reported case, a user logged in as "test02" was forced to comment on an article via a crafted request initiated by an attacker using a separate "test01" account.

**Attack vectors:**
   - An attacker needs to create a malicious webpage or link containing a crafted request.
   - The attacker then tricks a logged-in victim user into visiting the malicious page/link.
   - The victim's browser, upon visiting this page/link, sends the malicious request to the vulnerable YzmCMS server, using the victim's valid session, thereby performing the unwanted action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker must have the ability to create a malicious webpage or link.
   - The attacker does not need to be logged into the target system.
   - The attacker needs the target user to have an active authenticated session on the vulnerable YzmCMS site.

The maintainers of YzmCMS have classified the vulnerability as "not a security vulnerability" and therefore, will not be fixing the issue.
