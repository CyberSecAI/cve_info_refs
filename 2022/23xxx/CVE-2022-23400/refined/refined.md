- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `IGXMPXMLParser::parseDelimiter` function due to an off-by-one error. The function copies data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, but it doesn't properly account for a potential shift in the target buffer's starting address, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is crafted to be larger than the buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to incorrect buffer size calculation when parsing delimiters in XMP metadata within a PSD file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to denial of service (program crash) due to stack corruption. In some cases, it could potentially lead to information leaks if the stack canary is partially overwritten.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially-crafted PSD file containing malicious XMP metadata.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PSD file to a vulnerable application that uses the affected Accusoft ImageGear library.
