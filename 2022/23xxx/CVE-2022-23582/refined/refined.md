Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `TensorShape` constructor within the `TensorByteSize` function. The `TensorShape` constructor throws a `CHECK`-fail if the shape is partial or if the number of elements in the shape would cause an integer overflow. The function was designed to return -1 if the shape was not fully defined.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper error handling: The function used `TensorShape` which was not suitable to handle partial shapes. The `CHECK`-fail would cause program termination instead of gracefully returning `-1`.
- Integer overflow: The `TensorShape` constructor also fails when the number of elements overflows the maximum integer size, leading to program termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious user can create a `SavedModel` containing a tensor with a partial shape or a large number of elements, triggering the `CHECK`-fail in `TensorByteSize`, which causes a program crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Manipulating `SavedModel` files: Attackers can craft a malicious `SavedModel` with specific tensor shapes designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- Remote exploitation: As the `SavedModel` could be loaded remotely, this allows an attack vector via malicious model files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to modify or create `SavedModel` files.
- Ability to cause the vulnerable code to load and process the manipulated model.
- No specific network access or privileges required, as the vulnerability is triggered during the model loading process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix replaces `TensorShape` with `PartialTensorShape`, which can handle partial shapes without triggering a `CHECK`-fail.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.8.0, and the fix has been backported to 2.5.3, 2.6.3 and 2.7.1.
- The commit `c2426bba00a01de6913738df8fa78e0215fcce02` patches this vulnerability.
