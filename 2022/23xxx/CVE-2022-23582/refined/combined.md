This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Use `PartialTensorShape` instead of `TensorShape`.

```
`TensorShape` constructor throws a CHECK-fail if shape is partial/overflows which the other doesn't. We are only determining the number of elements in the shape and partial shape should be used as it returns negative number when needed.

# `CHECK`-failures in `TensorByteSize`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-4j82-5ccr-4r8v
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that [`TensorByteSize`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value_util.cc#L46-L50) would trigger `CHECK` failures.

```
int64_t TensorByteSize(const TensorProto& t) {
  // num_elements returns -1 if shape is not fully defined.
  int64_t num_elems = TensorShape(t.tensor_shape()).num_elements();
  return num_elems < 0 ? -1 : num_elems * DataTypeSize(t.dtype());
}
```

`TensorShape` constructor throws a `CHECK`-fail if shape is partial or has a number of elements that would overflow the size of an `int`. The `PartialTensorShape` constructor instead does not cause a `CHECK`-abort if the shape is partial, which is exactly what this function needs to be able to return `-1`.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c2426bba00a01de6913738df8fa78e0215fcce02](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c2426bba00a01de6913738df8fa78e0215fcce02).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23582

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
