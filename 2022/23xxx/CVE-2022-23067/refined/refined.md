Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23067:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the leakage of sensitive tokens (password reset/signup tokens) via the Referer header. This occurs when a user opens an invite/signup link in ToolJet and then clicks on any external link within the page. The browser sends the referrer header with the request to the external link which might contain the token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information (tokens) through the Referer header, which is not intended for such data transmission.
*   **Insecure handling of tokens:** The tokens are not being handled with adequate security measures, allowing them to be sent in the Referer header.
*   **Lack of input validation or sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or remove the token from the URL before redirecting the user or loading external links in the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker who obtains a leaked token can use it to gain unauthorized access to a user's account and change the password, effectively taking over the account.
*   **Confidentiality breach:** Sensitive user information can be exposed through the compromised account.
*   **Integrity breach:** An attacker might also modify the application data using the compromised account.
*   **Availability impact:** The attacker might also deny legitimate user access to the application by changing the password or locking the account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Referer Header Leakage:** The primary attack vector involves the exploitation of the Referer header, using external links embedded in invitation/signup pages that leak the tokens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Interception of HTTP requests:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept HTTP requests or have access to network logs to view the Referer header containing the token. This can be done using a web proxy or by monitoring network traffic.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker requires the victim to load an invite/signup page from tooljet and click an external link present in the page for the token to be sent to the attacker.

**Additional Details**
*   **Affected Versions:** ToolJet versions v0.5.0 to v1.2.2 are affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version v1.3.0 and later.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8, with a Network attack vector, Low attack complexity, no privileges required, and User Interaction required.
*   The commit `eacbfc4c9da089ff9cda9edf8a1156390ae8a101` on the ToolJet github repository is related to this fix. The commit modifies the `App.jsx` and `ConfirmationPage.jsx` files to handle the tokens correctly, and redirects the user to confirmation page instead of directly using the token from the URL.
