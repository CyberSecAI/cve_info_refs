Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23638:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of SVG files, specifically related to the handling of `font` tags with `face`, `color`, or `size` attributes and invalid nodes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `svg-sanitizer` library was not properly removing potentially malicious `font` tags with specific attributes, which can break out of foreign content.
- The library also fails to remove invalid or malformed nodes if they do not have a `tagName` property, leading to possible XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by allowing an attacker to inject malicious code through crafted SVG files. This could compromise the security of applications using the library. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on availability (A:H), likely due to the potential for denial-of-service attacks by injecting crafted SVG content.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local (AV:L) which implies the attacker needs to have local access to exploit the vulnerability and the user interaction is none(UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide or manipulate SVG files that are processed by the vulnerable `svg-sanitizer` library. This would involve either uploading a malicious SVG or crafting it directly.
- No user interaction is needed for the exploitation to occur.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix involves removing the `font` tag when `face`, `color`, or `size` attributes are present.
- The fix also addresses the handling of invalid nodes by properly removing them if they are not deemed safe.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 0.15.0.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate.
- The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2022-23638 and GHSA-fqx8-v33p-4qcc.
