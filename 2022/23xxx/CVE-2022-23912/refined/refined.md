Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape the `id` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs because user-supplied data (the `id` parameter) is included in the server's response without adequate sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of a user who clicks the malicious link.
*   This can lead to various consequences, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting the victim to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL.
*   Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is used to inject the malicious payload:
    `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=apct_testimonial_edit&id=1"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking the malicious link. This can be done through various means like phishing emails or malicious links on other websites.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.8 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerable code was present in the `apct_current_testimonial.php` file.
*   The fix involved using `esc_html()` to escape the `$_SESSION['apct_message']` variable and `wpdb->prepare` to sanitize the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the database query and  `intval()` and `esc_url()` on other vulnerable $_GET parameters.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Rafael Castilho.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The provided CVSS score is 6.1 (Medium). The vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`

**Summary of Changes in version 1.4.8 (relevant to the vulnerability):**

*   The plugin version was updated to 1.4.8 in `ap-custom-testimonial.php` and `readme.txt`.
*   In `apct_current_testimonial.php`, the code was modified to escape the message coming from session variable and sanitise the GET parameters before being used in database queries and HTML attributes.
*   The `author_name`, `author_company`, `author_position`, `author_email` and `apct_upload_image_url` fields are set to be required in the edit form.
