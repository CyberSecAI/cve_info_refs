The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in XMPie uStore, an e-commerce platform, which are relevant to CVE-2022-23321.

**Root cause of vulnerabilities:**
*   **Default Credentials:** The application ships with default "admin/admin" credentials.
*   **Unrestricted SQL Queries:** The application allows administrators to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User input is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored and executed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Use of default credentials:**  The system's initial administrative account uses default credentials, making it easily accessible to unauthorized individuals.
*   **SQL Injection:**  The ability to execute raw SQL queries without sanitization can lead to data breaches, including access to sensitive information like password hashes.
*   **Persistent XSS:**  Unsanitized user inputs allow for the injection of malicious JavaScript that can compromise user sessions and potentially lead to unauthorized actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain full administrative control of the uStore application by using default credentials.
*   **Data Breaches:** Attackers can steal sensitive data, including user information, password hashes, and decryption keys, by exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Account Takeover/Session Hijacking:** Attackers can use XSS to steal cookies, gain remote control of a user's host, redirect the browser to malicious sites, or perform unwanted actions.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The application exposes a login interface on port 80, making it accessible to anyone with network access.
*   **Web Interface:** Vulnerabilities exist within the application's web interface, including the administrative portal and user setup pages.
*   **SQL Interface:** The application allows for direct execution of SQL queries through the admin interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the target system.
*   **Basic knowledge of web security:** The attacker needs to know how to register a user, use default credentials, use tools like dirsearch, and perform basic SQL queries.
*   **Admin access to SQL feature:** For SQL injection, the attacker needs to log into the admin interface.
*   **Admin access to vulnerable input:** For XSS, the attacker needs admin access to the user setup page to insert the malicious script.
