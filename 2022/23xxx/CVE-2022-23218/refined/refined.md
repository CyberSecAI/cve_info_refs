{
  "CVE-2022-23218": {
    "Root cause": "The `svcunix_create` function in the sunrpc module copies its path argument onto the stack without validating its length.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service or arbitrary code execution (if application isn't built with a stack protector).",
    "Attack vectors": "Passing an overlong pathname argument to `svcunix_create`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the pathname argument passed to the `svcunix_create` function."
  }
}
