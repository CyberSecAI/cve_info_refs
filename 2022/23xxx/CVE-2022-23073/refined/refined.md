  "CVE-2022-23073": {
    "description": "In Recipes, versions 1.0.5 through 1.2.5 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), in copy to clipboard functionality. When a victim accesses the food list page, then adds a new Food with a malicious javascript payload in the ‘Name’ parameter and clicks on the clipboard icon, an XSS payload will trigger. A low privileged attacker will have the victim's API key and can lead to admin's account takeover.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying it in the 'copy to clipboard' functionality.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
      ],
      "impact": "A low-privileged attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that, when executed, can steal the victim's API key. This stolen API key can then be used to escalate privileges and potentially take over an administrator's account.",
      "attack_vector": "Network",
       "attacker_capabilities": "Low-privileged attacker capable of adding a new food item with a malicious payload."

Log in as an administrator and navigate to the food list page.\n4. Click the clipboard icon next to the malicious entry to trigger the XSS.\n5. The attacker's server receives the admin's API key in the listener.",
