Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23108:

**CVE-2022-23108**

*   **Root Cause:** The Badge Plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when creating custom build badges. Specifically, it doesn't escape the description and doesn't check for allowed protocols when creating a badge.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize the description field and does not check the protocols of the provided URLs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the badge description, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected builds or pages displaying the badge. This can allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of those users, steal cookies, or redirect to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can configure the badge plugin by creating custom build badges with a malicious description or URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have "Item/Configure" permission to configure builds with custom badges.

**Summary of CVE-2022-23108:**
The Badge plugin before version 1.9.1 is vulnerable to stored XSS.  By crafting a malicious description or URL an attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject and execute arbitrary javascript code in the browsers of users viewing the crafted badge.
