Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23463:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of `StandardEvaluationContext` in the `DiscoveryExpressionResolver.eval` method to evaluate user-provided expressions. This allows for the execution of arbitrary code via SpEL (Spring Expression Language) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SpEL Injection:** The application does not sanitize or restrict user input passed to the `expression` parameter. This input is then evaluated as a SpEL expression using a `StandardEvaluationContext`, which allows access to Java classes and methods.
*   **Unrestricted SpEL Context:** The use of `StandardEvaluationContext` is the primary vulnerability. It provides a wide range of capabilities, including access to Java types, constructors, and bean references, which should be restricted when handling untrusted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting a malicious SpEL expression. The provided PoC demonstrates this by executing a `touch` command on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/strategy/validate-expression` endpoint.
*   **`expression` Parameter:** The malicious SpEL expression is injected through the `expression` parameter in the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server where the vulnerable application is running.
*   **Understanding of SpEL:** The attacker needs knowledge of Spring Expression Language to craft malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the information provided, it appears that no authentication is required to access the `/strategy/validate-expression` endpoint, making exploitation easier.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `discovery-commons` module.
*   The `DiscoveryExpressionResolver` is the key component responsible for the SpEL evaluation.
*   The `StrategyEndpoint` and `StrategyResource` classes pass user-provided input to the vulnerable method.
*   The provided resources point to specific lines of code within the affected files.
*   The suggested remediation is to use `SimpleEvaluationContext` instead of `StandardEvaluationContext`.

**Summary**

CVE-2022-23463 is a critical vulnerability due to the ease of exploitation and the severe impact of RCE. An attacker can easily execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable server by sending a simple HTTP request with a crafted SpEL expression.
