Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23111:

**CVE-2022-23111**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Publish Over SSH Plugin does not enforce the use of POST requests for methods that perform connection tests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The lack of POST request enforcement for connection tests allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent.
    *   **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin does not validate user permissions before performing connection tests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials. This could potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive information if the attacker gains access to the SSH server.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, will connect to the attacker's SSH server using credentials available to the user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into triggering a crafted request.
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided text notes that at the time of publication, there was no fix available for this vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is related to another vulnerability in the same plugin, CVE-2022-23112, which is due to missing permission checks in the connection test methods.
