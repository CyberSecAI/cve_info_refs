- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize form field inputs before outputting them in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to escape user-provided data, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the plugin's form fields. When the form is displayed, the script will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A high-privilege user (Admin+) needs to create or edit a form and insert the malicious payload into a Field Name or Default Value field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have admin-level privileges within the WordPress site to create/edit forms within the plugin.
