{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The introduction of a new `/v1/sql-runner` endpoint in the Cube.js API gateway bypassed row-level security checks implemented in the modeling layer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `/v1/sql-runner` endpoint directly executes SQL queries, bypassing security checks",
        "Lack of proper authorization and access control on the new `/v1/sql-runner` endpoint."
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated users could bypass row-level security and run arbitrary SQL queries, potentially accessing data they were not authorized to view.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network access to the `/v1/sql-runner` endpoint.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs a valid Cube JWT token to access the API."
