Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in `ImmutableExecutorState::Initialize` function in TensorFlow. Specifically, when a graph node is invalid, and the kernel creation fails, the code sets the kernel pointer `item->kernel` to `nullptr` without deleting the memory allocated for the `OpKernel` object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The code does not properly release the memory allocated for the `OpKernel` object when kernel creation fails. This leads to a memory leak that can accumulate over time.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak can potentially cause resource exhaustion if numerous invalid graph nodes are encountered. This can lead to denial of service and slow down performance.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a graph with invalid nodes to TensorFlow's `ImmutableExecutorState::Initialize` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted TensorFlow graph containing invalid nodes to trigger the memory leak.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue is available in the commit [c79ccba517dbb1a0ccb9b01ee3bd2a63748b60dd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c79ccba517dbb1a0ccb9b01ee3bd2a63748b60dd).
- Patched versions are 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1 and the fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
- The vulnerability has been rated as low severity.
