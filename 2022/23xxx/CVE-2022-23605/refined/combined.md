# Expired Ephemeral Messages not reliably removed from local chat history

Moderate

[comawill](/comawill)
published
GHSA-2w3m-ppfg-hg62
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

wire-webapp
(wire)

## Affected versions

<= 2021-12-02-production.0

## Patched versions

2022-01-27-production.0

## Description

### Impact

Expired Ephemeral Messages were not reliably removed from local chat history of **Wire Webapp** and **Wire Desktop Clients**.

In versions before **2022-01-27-production.0** ephemeral messages and assets might still be accessible through the local search functionality.

Any attempt to view one of these message in the chat view will then trigger the deletion.

This issue only affects locally stored messages.

### Patches

* The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp **2022-01-27-production.0** and is already deployed on all Wire managed services.
* Users of [app.wire.com](https://app.wire.com) are already using an updated version and need no further action.
* On premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to **2022-01-27-production.0**, so that their users are no longer affected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
