Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23605:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that expired ephemeral messages were not being reliably removed from the local chat history in Wire Webapp and Wire Desktop Clients. Specifically, these expired messages and assets could still be accessible through the local search functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Failure to Delete Expired Ephemeral Messages:** The core weakness is the application's failure to consistently remove ephemeral messages from local storage after their expiration.
*   **Local Storage Access:** The vulnerability exposes expired message data through the local search functionality.
*   **Data Retention:** Expired ephemeral data remained accessible, violating the intended behavior of ephemeral messaging.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with local access to the application's data could potentially access the content of expired ephemeral messages, which were intended to be temporary. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Circumvention of Ephemeral Messaging:** The vulnerability undermines the ephemeral messaging feature, potentially leading to users mistakenly believing their messages have been deleted when they have not.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the device where the Wire application is installed.
*   **Search Functionality:** Exploitation involves using the local search feature to find and view expired ephemeral messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the machine or device where the vulnerable Wire application is installed and has access to the user's profile.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to use the search functionality.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of Wire Webapp and Wire Desktop Clients prior to `2022-01-27-production.0` are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version `2022-01-27-production.0`.
*   **Patch Details:** The patch includes changes to the `ConversationRepository.ts`, `ConversationService.ts` and `EventService.ts` to improve ephemeral message handling.
    *   The `validateMessages` method was introduced in `ConversationRepository.ts` to validate and filter messages. The `addEventsToConversation` now uses `validateMessages` to validate incoming messages.
    *   The `cleanupEphemeralMessages` method now uses `this.validateMessages` to validate messages and remove them if necessary.
    *   The `searchInConversation` method in `ConversationService.ts` was updated to filter out messages that have expired.
    *   The `loadEphemeralEvents` was added to load ephemeral messages and the `loadEventsWithCategory` in `EventService.ts` was changed to include filtering of expired messages.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.4, with a local attack vector and high confidentiality impact, but no integrity or availability impact.
*   **Severity:** The severity of the vulnerability is considered moderate.
*   **Mitigation:** Users of `app.wire.com` are automatically updated. On-premise instances must be updated to the patched version.
