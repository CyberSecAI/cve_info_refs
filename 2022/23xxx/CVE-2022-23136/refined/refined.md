Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23136:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in ZTE home gateway products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability. Specifically, the gateway name is vulnerable to modification by an attacker through the injection of special characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    -  Session hijacking.
    -  Defacement of the management page.
    -  Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    -  Potentially gaining control of the gateway depending on the context of the XSS.
    -  Accessing sensitive information displayed on the gateway's management page

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker modifies the gateway name, injecting malicious code into the relevant field.
- When the user then views the topology of the device through the management page the malicious code is executed, leading to an XSS attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) on the device to modify the gateway name.
- The attack requires the victim user to view a specific page of the management interface (User Interaction: Required).
- The attack requires the attacker to be on the same network segment or have access to the management interface. (Attack Vector: Adjacent)
