Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `AddNode` function within `tensorflow/core/graph/graph.cc`. Specifically, during node construction, a type constructor (`ctor_type`) is invoked to determine the full type of the node. The result of this constructor is a `StatusOr<FullTypeDef>`. The code was calling `ValueOrDie()` on this `StatusOr` without checking if it represents an error. If `ctor_type` results in an error status, `ValueOrDie()` would lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unchecked Error Status:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of error checking before calling `ValueOrDie()` on the `StatusOr<FullTypeDef>` object returned by `SpecializeType`. This allows an error condition to propagate and cause a crash, instead of handling it gracefully.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting a malicious `GraphDef` (likely within a `SavedModel`) that causes `SpecializeType` to return an error, an attacker could cause a TensorFlow process to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious GraphDef:** The attack vector is a maliciously crafted `GraphDef`, most likely embedded within a TensorFlow `SavedModel`. An attacker would need to create a node definition that triggers the error condition in `SpecializeType` when constructing the graph.
*   **Loading Malicious SavedModel:** By loading such a crafted `SavedModel`, the vulnerability can be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create/modify SavedModels:** The attacker must be able to create or modify a TensorFlow `SavedModel` to include the malicious `GraphDef`.
*   **Ability to load SavedModels:** The attacker needs to have the ability to have the malicious model loaded by a vulnerable TensorFlow instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in TensorFlow versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.1, but was fixed in 2.7.1 by adding a check for an error status.
*   The fix (commit `955059813cc325dc1db5e2daa6221271406d4439`) adds an explicit check using `!ctor_type.ok()` before attempting to extract the value. If an error is detected, it now returns the error status.

This vulnerability is categorized as a "Moderate" severity issue due to the potential for denial of service.
