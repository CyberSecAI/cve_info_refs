# Arbitrary file write when scanning a specially-crafted remote PyPI package

Moderate

Dec 5, 2022

## Package

pip

guarddog
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<v0.1.7

## Patched versions

v0.1.8

## Description

### Summary

Unsafe extracting using `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a remotely retrieved tarball may lead to writing the extracted file to an unintended destination.

### Details

Extracting files using `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a potentially malicious tarball without validating that the destination file path is within the intended destination directory can cause files outside the destination directory to be overwritten.

The vulnerable code snippet is between [L153..158](https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/blob/a1d064ceb09d39bb28deb6972bc0a278756ea91f/guarddog/scanners/package_scanner.py#L153..158).

```
response = requests.get(url, stream=True)

with open(zippath, "wb") as f:
      f.write(response.raw.read())

shutil.unpack_archive(zippath, unzippedpath)
```

It seems that a remotely retrieved tarball which could be with the extension `.tar.gz` happens to be unpacked using `shutil.unpack_archive()` with no destination verification/limitation of the extracted files.

### PoC

The PoC provided showcases the risk of extracting the non-harmless text file `sim4n6.txt` to a parent location rather than the current folder.

```
> tar --list -f archive.tar
tar: Removing leading `../../../' from member names
../../../sim4n6.txt

> python3
Python 3.10.6 (main, Nov  2 2022, 18:53:38) [GCC 11.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import shutil
>>> shutil.unpack_archive("archive.tar")
>>> exit()

> file ../../../sim4n6.txt
../../../sim4n6.txt: ASCII text
```
### A Potential Attack Scenario

* An attacker may craft a malicious tarball with a filename path, such as `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, and then serve the archive remotely, thus, providing a possibility to overwrite the system files.

### Mitigation

Potential mitigation could be to:

* Use a safer module, like `zipfile`.
* Validate the location of the extracted files and discard those with malicious paths such as a relative path `..` or absolute ones.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
