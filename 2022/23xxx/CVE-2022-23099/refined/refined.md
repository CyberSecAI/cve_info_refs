  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Existing sanitization and filtering mechanisms for HTML files can be bypassed by forcing block-wise read. Using this technique, the recognition procedure misses to detect tags and attributes that span multiple blocks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-80)",
       "Bypass of sanitization and filtering"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (e.g., redirecting to a third-party site).",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker creates a malicious HTML code snippet with masked tags by block boundaries, uploads it to drive, creates a sharing link, and sends that link to a victim.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to upload files to OX Drive and create sharing links. The victim needs to follow a malicious link."
