# Denial of service through schema file

Moderate

[hickeyma](/hickeyma)
published
GHSA-67fx-wx78-jx33
Dec 14, 2022

## Package

gomod

helm.sh/helm/v3
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=v3.10.2

## Patched versions

v3.10.3

## Description

Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the *chartutil* package that can cause a segmentation violation. Applications that use functions from the *chartutil* package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.

### Impact

The *chartutil* package contains a parser that loads a JSON Schema validation file. For example, the Helm client when rendering a chart will validate its values with the schema file. The *chartutil* package parses the schema file and loads it into structures Go can work with. Some schema files can cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.

Applications that use the *chartutil* package in the Helm SDK to parse a schema file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.

The Helm Client will panic with a schema file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.

### Patches

This issue has been resolved in 3.10.3.

### Workarounds

SDK users can validate schema files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the *chartutil* functions.

### For more information

Helm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.

### Credits

Disclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23526

### Weaknesses

[CWE-476](/advisories?query=cwe%3A476)
