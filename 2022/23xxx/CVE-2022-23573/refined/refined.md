Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23573

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `AssignOp` implementation in TensorFlow's core kernels was not checking if the right-hand side (rhs) tensor was initialized before copying its data. It only checked if the left-hand side (lhs) was initialized. This allowed copying of uninitialized data, which could lead to undefined behavior when used later in the graph execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of initialization check on the right-hand side of the assignment operation.
- Potential for copying uninitialized memory into a new tensor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Undefined behavior due to usage of uninitialized memory.
- The vulnerability could potentially lead to crashes, unexpected outputs, or other unpredictable issues. The copied uninitialized data might contain garbage values or even null pointer references.

**Attack Vectors:**
- This vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted TensorFlow graph that uses the `AssignOp` with an uninitialized right-hand side tensor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a TensorFlow model/graph that includes the problematic `AssignOp` with an uninitialized right-hand side.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check to ensure that the right-hand side tensor is initialized before any data is copied.
- The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1 and will be present in 2.8.0.
- The commit [ef1d027be116f25e25bb94a60da491c2cf55bd0b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ef1d027be116f25e25bb94a60da491c2cf55bd0b) contains the fix.
