## Package

composer

codeigniter4/framework
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 4.2.11

## Patched versions

4.2.11

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability may allow attackers to spoof their IP address when your server is behind a reverse proxy.

### Patches

Upgrade to v4.2.11 or later, and configure `Config\App::$proxyIPs`.

### Workarounds

Do not use `$request->getIPAddress()`.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
