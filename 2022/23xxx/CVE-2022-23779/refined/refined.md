- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server redirects certain URLs, and during these redirects, the internal hostname of the server is exposed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Internal hostname disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of the internal hostname, potentially aiding further attacks by providing information about the internal network structure.
- **Attack vectors**: By making requests that trigger specific URL redirects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to make web requests to the affected Endpoint Central server.
