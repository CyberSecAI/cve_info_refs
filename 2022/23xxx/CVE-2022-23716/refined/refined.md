**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The SAML signing private key, used for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) features, was inadvertently included in deployment logs within the Logging and Monitoring cluster.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The private key's presence in logs exposed it to unauthorized access.
-   **CWE-532:** Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **High Impact:** The vulnerability has a CVSSv3.1 score of 8.7, indicating a high severity.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
-  Exploitation requires high privileges (PR:H), suggesting that the attacker would need platform admin access to reach the Logging and Monitoring cluster logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs access to the Logging and Monitoring cluster, typically requiring a platform admin role within Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE).
-   The attacker would need to be able to view the logs where the key was exposed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Elastic Cloud Enterprise versions prior to 3.1.1.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.1.1 and later.
- The Elastic Security Advisory (ESA-2022-11) was issued to address this vulnerability.
