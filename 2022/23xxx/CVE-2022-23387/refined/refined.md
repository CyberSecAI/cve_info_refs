The provided content relates to CVE-2022-23387.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL blind injection vulnerability present in the "Comment Update" functionality of the taocms application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL blind injection. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the comment update functionality is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, or potentially modify the data. The use of `sleep(10)` in the provided example indicates that an attacker could use time-based blind SQL injection to extract information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted POST request to `/admin/admin.php` with specific parameters. The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter, which is part of the comment update functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires access to the admin panel of the taocms application. The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the `/admin/admin.php` endpoint with the specified parameters.

**Technical details:**

The vulnerable request is:
```
POST /admin/admin.php HTTP/1.1
Host: taocms.test
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 56

action=comment&id=5)and(sleep(10))--+&ctrl=update&name=a
```
The attacker injects `)and(sleep(10))--+` into the `id` parameter. This causes the database to pause for 10 seconds if the SQL injection is successful, confirming the presence of the vulnerability.
The injection point is within `include/Model/Comment.php`
The SQL queries are built within `include/Db/Mysql.php`.
