{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A compromised gateway server was used to intercept communication between users and the legitimate October CMS marketplace service.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Man-in-the-middle attack, insecure communication with the marketplace server, lack of server-side signature verification in older versions, exposure of private data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Capture of personal and business information of users and authors, including private license keys and source code files, unauthorized redistribution of plugin files, potential financial loss for authors.",
  "Attack vectors": "A forked version of October CMS v1.0 was modified to use a compromised gateway server, tricking users into providing their license keys and other information to the attacker's server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to set up a malicious server that mimics the genuine October CMS marketplace server, ability to distribute a modified version of October CMS to unsuspecting users."
