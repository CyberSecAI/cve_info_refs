- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from the possibility of embedding malicious SVG files in `com_media`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web application through SVG files, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through uploading or embedding SVG files via the `com_media` component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to upload or embed SVG files through the Joomla! media manager (`com_media`). This likely requires some level of access to the backend or a method to influence content managed by `com_media`.
