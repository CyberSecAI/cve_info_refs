- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When the Octopus Server HTTP and HTTPS bindings are configured to localhost, the server allows open redirects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially redirect users to a malicious site.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when accessed, redirects to an arbitrary external site due to the open redirect vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious URLs to users of the Octopus Server.
