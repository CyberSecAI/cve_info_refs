Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23117:

**CVE-2022-23117**

*   **Root Cause:** The Conjur Secrets Plugin allows agent processes to retrieve all username/password credentials stored on the Jenkins controller. This is due to a lack of proper access control or validation of requests from agent processes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Agent-to-controller security bypass:** The plugin implements functionality that allows agent processes to bypass intended security mechanisms.
    *   **Lack of access control:** Agent processes are able to access all username/password credentials without proper authorization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker who has control of an agent process can retrieve all username/password credentials stored in Jenkins. This allows an attacker to potentially gain full access to systems and services that use these credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to compromise a Jenkins agent process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to gain control over a Jenkins agent process.
    *   The attacker does not need any specific user privileges within the Jenkins system to exploit this, other than the ability to control an agent process.
