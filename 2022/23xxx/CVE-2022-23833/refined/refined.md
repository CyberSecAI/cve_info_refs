*   GitHub Advisory Database:
    *   `An issue was discovered in MultiPartParser in Django 2.2 before 2.2.27, 3.2 before 3.2.12, and 4.0 before 4.0.2. Passing certain inputs to multipart forms could result in an infinite loop when parsing files.`

This confirms that all the provided content relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `MultiPartParser` within Django's handling of multipart form data, specifically how it processes file uploads. Certain malformed inputs can cause the parser to enter an infinite loop.
*   **Weakness:** The `MultiPartParser` does not properly handle certain types of multipart form data, leading to a denial-of-service condition. There's a lack of input sanitization or proper handling of edge cases related to the structure of the multipart data, potentially when using base64 encoding.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. An attacker can send crafted multipart form data that triggers an infinite loop in the parser, consuming server resources and potentially causing the application to become unresponsive.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious multipart form that contains specific types of malformed data when uploading files. This is typically done via HTTP requests to a Django application endpoint that processes multipart form data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to a Django application that is vulnerable. No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned for the exploitation.

**3. Technical Details & Descriptions:**

The vulnerability specifically resides within the `parse` method of the `multipartparser.py` file. The problematic logic involves handling remaining bytes after reading a chunk of input, which can cause an infinite loop if specific malformed base64 encoded data is supplied.

The fix involves a check to ensure that the `read` method called on the field stream does not return an empty chunk to prevent the infinite loop. The fix is shown in the code diff:

```diff
@@ -240,6 +240,8 @@ def parse(self):
        remaining = len(stripped_chunk) % 4
        while remaining != 0:
            over_chunk = field_stream.read(4 - remaining)
            if not over_chunk:
                break
            stripped_chunk += b"".join(over_chunk.split())
            remaining = len(stripped_chunk) % 4

```

**4. Affected Versions & Patched Versions:**

The vulnerability affects Django versions:

*   >= 2.2, < 2.2.27
*   >= 3.2, < 3.2.12
*   >= 4.0, < 4.0.2

The patched versions are:

*   2.2.27
*   3.2.12
*   4.0.2

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as a "medium" severity issue according to Django's security policy.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Alan Ryan.
*   Patches were backported from the main branch to the 2.2, 3.2 and 4.0 release branches.
*   The issue is related to parsing of multipart data with the `MultiPartParser` class.

In summary, CVE-2022-23833 is a DoS vulnerability in Django's multipart form handling that can be triggered by specific types of crafted data in file uploads. The fix involves adding a check to prevent an infinite loop when reading from the field stream during the parsing process.
