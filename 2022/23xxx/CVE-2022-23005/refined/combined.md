## Host Boot ROM Code Vulnerability in Systems Implementing UFS Boot Feature

---

**WDC Tracking Number:** WDC-23001

**Published:** January 12, 2023

**Last Updated:**  January 12, 2023

#### Description

Western Digital has identified a weakness in systems using the UFS standard that could result in a security vulnerability. This vulnerability may exist in systems where the host boot ROM code implements the UFS Boot feature to boot from UFS-compliant storage devices. UFS devices are only affected when connected to a vulnerable UFS Host and are not independently impacted by this vulnerability. When present, the vulnerability is in the UFS Host implementation and is not a vulnerability in Western Digital UFS Devices.

The UFS Boot feature, as specified in the UFS standard, is provided by UFS devices to support platforms that need to download the system boot loader from external non-volatile storage locations.

Several scenarios have been identified in which adversaries may disable the boot capability or revert to an old boot loader code if the host boot ROM code is improperly implemented. UFS Host Boot ROM implementers may be impacted by this vulnerability.

Western Digital has provided details of the vulnerability to the JEDEC standards body, multiple host processor vendors, and software solutions providers. Western Digital is publishing this bulletin as part of a multi-party coordinated vulnerability disclosure process to promote security in embedded storage applications.

#### Update Availability/Remediation

Updates should be provided by vendors of host systems which rely on the UFS boot feature as part of their architecture. Affected product vendors should reach out to the provider of their host processor or for details on remediation status.

#### Advisory Summary

This vulnerability may be present in any system using the UFS Boot feature, regardless of manufacturer. The UFS boot feature is provided by UFS devices to support platforms that need to download the system boot loader from an external non-volatile source. To accomplish this, the host reads the Boot Well Known Logical Unit (BOOT WKLU) data at system startup. This step is required for the platform to access the host SoC boot code.

The attack scenarios allow an attacker to completely disable the boot capability of the host platform, rendering the platform useless, or in some cases, it allows the attacker to revert to an old boot loader code. These scenarios may arise due to improper validation of UFS attributes in the host boot ROM code. The attack scenarios typically require elevated permissions on the UFS host, which may be obtained through a separate chain of vulnerabilities involving escalation of privileges. Physical access to the host platform or device is not required.

**Disabling platform boot capability scenario:**

An attacker which has the requisite permissions to access the bBootLunEn attribute may disable the UFS Boot feature by setting the bBootLunEn attribute to 0x0 in the UFS device. After platform power-up or reset, host Boot ROM code tries to read the Boot Well Known Logical Unit data from the UFS device, however, since the UFS Boot feature was disabled, the operation fails and the host is no longer able to boot.

**Downgrade attack scenario:**

In the downgrade attack scenario, the adversary sets bBootLunEn to the alternate Boot LU, causing the host platform to boot with a potentially old version of the boot code.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2022-23005](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23005)

WHITE PAPERHost boot ROM code vulnerability

Introduction

1.
Boot Well Known Logical Unit (Boot WKLU) is a UFS
feature, first introduced to UFS standard in UFSv1.1. The
feature still exists and is still widely used in the industry
through UFS v4.0 standard supporting products.

Depicted in Figure a-2 is a ROM code boot flow to access
the UFS device Boot WKLU to read the platform boot
code. In this diagram, before the ROM code access the
Boot WKLU, it does not check that the boot feature is
enabled.

2.   Relevant use cases for UFS Boot

feature
a.

 Platform Booting from Boot WKLU

The feature allows the host platform to download the
system boot loader from an external non-volatile device
by reading the Boot WKLU data at the system startup to
access the host SoC boot code.

The Boot Well Known Logical Unit has a pre-defined, fixed
by the standard number, W-LUN (30h) through which
the host may read the boot code. Boot Well Known
Logical Unit is a virtual reference to the actual logical unit
containing the boot code, as designated by the host
through bBootLunEn attribute.

Depicted in Figure a-1 is a platform with ROM code
accessing the UFS device Boot WKLU to read the platform
boot code. In this diagram, as the host is reading from
the virtual reference W-LUN (30h), the device provides
the data stored in LU A as the bBootLunEn attribute
references LU A. In case the attribute would reference LU
B, the device would provide data stored in Boot LU B.

Figure a-1: UFS System Diagram

Figure a-2: Naïve Boot flow

b.  Boot LUN Data Protection –

Data stored in the boot LUN (LUN A or LUN B) may be
configured by the host to be protected by the UFS device
in different ways: Permanent Write Protected, Power-on
Write Protected or Secure Write Protected.

When the boot LU data has a write Protection mechanism
enabled, normal-world applications cannot modify the
data in the Boot LU.

For example, depicted in Figure b-1 are boot LUNs which
are write protected by the device through permanent WP
mechanism, which prevents any change to the content of
the boot LU.

Figure b-1: Device Permanent Write Protection boot LUNs

Other types of Write Protection of the Boot LUN also
exist, which would protect the LUN from being changed
only by entities authorized by the TEE (through RPMB,
secure WP) or by entities after the boot code is read
(through Power-on WP).

Depicted in Figure b-2 are boot LUNs which are protected
using the Power-on WP mechanism. In case the host
platform is not initiating a BOOT LU update, it sets the
fPowerOnWPEn flag to block any update to the Boot
LUNs (which are configured with bLUWriteProtect = 1).

3.  Description of vulnerability

The vulnerability identified may take advantage of a naïve
ROM boot code implementation to allow an adversary to
make a host platform unusable by failing to complete its
boot process.

The adversary may disable the UFS Boot feature by
setting  bBootLunEn attribute to 0x0.

Depicted in Figure 3-1 is an event flow which describes
how an adversary can disable the normal boot flow. As a
result, the host boot ROM code is not able to handle the
unexpected situation and does not complete the platform
boot process.

*Another variant of the vulnerability is that the adversary
sets bBootLunEn to the alternate Boot LU causing the
host platform to boot with a potentially old version of the
boot code (Downgrade attack).

Depicted in Figure b-3 are boot LUNs which are protected
using the Secure WP mechanism. When the host is
updating the Boot LU from a secure environment, it sets
the RPMB Configuration block to allow writing to the Boot
LUNs and when finish updating the LUNs it close back the
Boot LUN for Write using the Secure WP mechanism.

b.  Option #2

a.  Option #1

If the ROM code is not able to complete the boot process
and enter the Error handling procedure as described in
Figure 3-1, it should enable the bBootLunEn to either LUN
A or LUN B and try to read the Boot WKLU

Before the ROM code starts reading the Boot WKLU, it
sets bBootLunEn to a valid LUN (either LUN A or LUN B)
from which the boot data is available.

feature is enabled

feature is enabled following a faliure to boot

c.  Option #3

ROM code may access the boot LU directly and not
through the WKLU mechanism. This could be achieved in
two methods:

1)

 Throughout the UFS device configuration process
the boot LUNs would be assigned to the LU Number
which the ROM code access to and by that the ROM
code would avoid using the bBootLunEn attribute.

2)   Alternatively, the ROM boot code may scan the

Unit Descriptors and identify the LU Numbers which
has bBootLunID sets to A or B, avoiding the use of
bBootLunEn attribute.

Other options also exist, depending on host
implementation.
