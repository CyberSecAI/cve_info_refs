# Path Traversal Vulnerability

High

[gem-neo4j](/gem-neo4j)
published
GHSA-5v8v-gwmw-qw97
Jan 13, 2023

## Package

maven

org.neo4j.procedure:apoc
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<4.3.0.12, <4.4.0.12

## Patched versions

4.3.0.12, 4.4.0.12

## Description

### Impact

A Path Traversal Vulnerability found in the apoc.export.\* procedures of apoc plugins in Neo4j Graph database.

The issue allows a malicious actor to potentially break out of the expected directory. The vulnerability is such that files could only be created but not overwritten.

For the vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker would need access to execute an arbitrary query, either by having access to an authenticated Neo4j client, or a Cypher injection vulnerability in an application. The procedure would need to have been allow listed in the neo4j configuration as well as having the apoc config `apoc.export.file.enabled` set to true.

On a UNIX based system the following query allows arbitrary write access to the tmp folder:

CALL apoc.export.csv.query('RETURN 1', 'file:///..//..//..//..//tmp/test.txt', {})

### Patches

The users should aim to use the latest released version compatible with their Neo4j version. The minimum versions containing patch for this vulnerability are 4.4.0.12 and 4.3.0.12.

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the [allowlist of the](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.security.procedures.allowlist) procedures that can be used in your system, and/or turn off local file access by setting apoc.export.file.enabled=false

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [neo4j-apoc-procedures](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
