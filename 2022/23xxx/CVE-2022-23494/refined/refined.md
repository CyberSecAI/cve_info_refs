  "CVE-2022-23494": {
    "Description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the alert and confirm dialogs when these dialogs were provided with malicious HTML content. This can occur in plugins that use the alert or confirm dialogs, such as in the `image` plugin, which presents these dialogs when certain errors occur. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an alert presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user.",
    "Root cause": "The alert and confirm dialogs in TinyMCE were not properly sanitizing HTML content, leading to potential XSS vulnerabilities.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the TinyMCE UI for the current user.",
    "Attack vectors": "Malicious HTML content is provided to the alert or confirm dialogs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious HTML content into dialogs triggered by TinyMCE plugins.",
    "Patched versions": "5.10.7 and 6.3.1",
    "Workaround": "Ensure that the `images_upload_handler` returns a valid value as per the documentation, to reduce the impact of the vulnerability, specifically if exploiting through the image plugin."
