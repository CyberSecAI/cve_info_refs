Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-23126:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure default configuration of TeslaMate's Docker installation, specifically the Grafana instance included with it.  By default, anonymous access was enabled and the default admin credentials were not changed, allowing unauthorized access. Additionally, the Tesla API tokens were stored unencrypted in the same database where Grafana could access them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Insecure Default Configuration:** Grafana, which is bundled with the default TeslaMate Docker image, had anonymous access enabled and also used default credentials (admin/admin). This made it trivially easy for an attacker to gain access to Grafana.
2.  **Unencrypted API Tokens:** Tesla API tokens were stored in the same database as other vehicle data, accessible via Grafana, without encryption.
3.  **Lack of Access Control:** The combination of default credentials, enabled anonymous access, and accessible storage of API tokens allowed unauthorized users to query and extract them.
4.  **Grafana API Endpoint Vulnerability:**  A Grafana API endpoint allowed for querying the tokens even without authentication (CVE-2022-23126). This was present in the default docker image before the patch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could:

1.  **Gain Full Remote Control:**  Obtain valid Tesla API tokens which grant the ability to control a wide range of vehicle functions.
2.  **Control Vehicle Features:**  Unlock doors, open windows, start "keyless driving," change climate control, honk the horn, flash lights, and even potentially open garage doors connected to the vehicle's homelink.
3. **Access Sensitive Data**: The attacker can access the vehicle's data logs, including driving history, locations, charging history, weather data, and other information.
4.  **Track Vehicle Location:** Access real-time and historical location data.
5.  **Potentially Steal the Vehicle:**  Using keyless driving and possibly the summon feature to move the car.
6.  **Annoy/Harass the Owner:** Blast music at max volume, repeatedly lock/unlock doors, or repeatedly flash lights
7. **Privacy violation**: Access the owner's personal information such as the vehicle's history and locations

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Internet Exposure:**  Deploying TeslaMate with its default Docker configuration, exposing the Grafana instance to the internet.
2.  **Publicly Accessible Grafana:** Accessing the Grafana dashboard via port 3000.
3.  **Exploiting Grafana API:**  Leveraging a Grafana API endpoint to extract the Tesla API tokens anonymously (before patch 1.25.1).
4.  **Using default admin password:** Login using admin:admin to access the Grafana dashboards and query the database for API tokens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Internet Access:**  The attacker must be able to access publicly exposed TeslaMate instances.
2.  **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of how to exploit default credentials, and the ability to use Grafana's querying capabilities.
3.  **Knowledge of Grafana's API:** The attacker can leverage the Grafana API to query the database.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by a security researcher who found multiple instances of exposed TeslaMate deployments.
*   The researcher was able to access the Tesla API tokens of over 25 Tesla vehicles.
*   Tesla revoked thousands of API tokens to mitigate the issue and notified affected users.
*   The TeslaMate maintainer released a patch (v1.25.1) which disables anonymous access to Grafana by default, and forces password changes at first login.
* The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-23126.
* A secondary, less impactful vulnerability was discovered with revoked V3 tokens still being able to retrieve user info (email). This was also fixed by Tesla
* Pin-to-drive can be bypassed through the "keyless driving" API call.
