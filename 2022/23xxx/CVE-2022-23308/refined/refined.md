  "CVE-2022-23308": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free of ID and IDREF attributes in the libxml2 library, specifically when parsing documents with XML_PARSE_DTDVALID and without XML_PARSE_NOENT. The value of ID attributes was not being correctly normalized after entity expansion, potentially leading to the use of a pointer to previously freed memory during subsequent calls to xmlGetID. Empty or whitespace-only ID attributes after entity expansion were also affected. Additionally, a broken test to detect streaming mode during DTD validation could result in a use-after-free when using the xmlReader interface with validation.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "libxml2 versions prior to 2.9.13"
    ],
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free of ID and IDREF attributes",
       "Incorrect normalization of ID attributes after entity expansion",
        "Broken detection of streaming mode when validating against a DTD"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the libxml2 library's handling of ID attributes during parsing with DTD validation, specifically, the failure to normalize the values of ID attributes after entity expansion and an error in the detection of streaming mode during validation.",
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to denial of service. Specifically, using xmlReader with validation could lead to disclosure of memory via the error channel (typically stderr). The security impact of `xmlGetID` returning a pointer to freed memory depends on the application but is likely to cause crashes. The typical use case of calling `xmlGetID` on an unmodified document is not affected.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Parsing a maliciously crafted XML document with XML_PARSE_DTDVALID and without XML_PARSE_NOENT",
      "Using the xmlReader interface with DTD validation and XIncludes referencing the root document"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted XML document to be parsed or have the system parse a maliciously crafted XML document.",
     "additional_details": [
        "The fix includes changes to how ID attributes are processed. ID attributes that are empty or contain only whitespace after entity expansion are no longer stored in the ID table.",
        "Multiple vendors have been identified as having potentially vulnerable products. Affected products include Fedora, Oracle products, NetApp products and Apple products."
