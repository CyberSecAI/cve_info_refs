| Jopin Remote Code ExecutionDescription Joplin is powered by Eelectron. When the victim press `Ctrl+P` to search content, if the payload is near the content(before the content), we can remotely execute any JavaScript code on the victim's computer.

| I have a question, if the vulnerability is meant to be kept from public eye until a fix is made/distributed, doesn't that commit reveal it before this fix is distributed, especially seeing that this fix now only went to a pre-release, not a new stable release? Have I misunderstood something about this? I guess it's impossible to commit something that isn't publicly shown in github, but then vulnerability fixes should pushed straight to stable releases? |

| It depends on the vulnerability. This one is difficult to exploit and thus it was decided to make the fix available from the pre-release. |
