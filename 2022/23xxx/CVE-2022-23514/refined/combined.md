# Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in Loofah

High

[flavorjones](/flavorjones)
published
GHSA-486f-hjj9-9vhh
Dec 13, 2022

## Package

bundler

loofah
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 2.19.1

## Patched versions

2.19.1

## Description

## Summary

Loofah `< 2.19.1` contains an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.

## Mitigation

Upgrade to Loofah `>= 2.19.1`.

## Severity

The Loofah maintainers have evaluated this as [High Severity 7.5 (CVSS3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Version        : 2.2.3-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-23514 CVE-2022-23515 CVE-2022-23516
Debian Bug     : 1026083

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Loofah, a Ruby library for
HTML/XML transformation and sanitization. An attacker could launch
cross-site scripting (XSS) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through
crafted HTML/XML documents.

CVE-2022-23514

    Inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive
    backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG
    attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU
    resource consumption.

CVE-2022-23515

    Cross-site scripting via the image/svg+xml media type in data
    URIs.

CVE-2022-23516

    Loofah uses recursion for sanitizing CDATA sections, making it
    susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a SystemStackError
    exception. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU
    resource consumption.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.3-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-loofah packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-loofah please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-loofah>
