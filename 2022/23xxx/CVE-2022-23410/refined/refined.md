- **Root cause of vulnerability**: DLL hijacking vulnerability in AXIS IP Utility
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application `IPUtility.exe` attempts to load DLLs from its current working directory without proper verification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution and local privilege escalation. If a malicious DLL is placed in the same folder as the executable, the application will load it, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Placing a malicious DLL in the same working directory as `IPUtility.exe`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same folder as the vulnerable `IPUtility.exe`.
