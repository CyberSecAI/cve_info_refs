| This is the latest 3.0.2 version of taocms.  Organize and utilize steps in two steps：  **Step1：** Audit the source code E:\xxx\taocms-3.0.2\include\Model\File.php, line 96, and find that there may be arbitrary new files vulnerability: [a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668218/150085971-dd25b15b-f35d-4972-94b3-5a1989cfae8a.png)  Follow up $this->realpath and find that it comes from $this->path, and $this->path can be passed in through the get parameter (where SYS\_ROOT is the root directory of the website): [b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668218/150086006-55b4f1b4-ecb9-4553-8909-9f508d793de2.png)  Here you can construct the request package for the new `test.php` file: [c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668218/150086021-6a272165-7dda-4b21-8aef-cc6f9b005cfd.png)  New test.php is successfully created: [d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668218/150086045-1bf9ef9d-d3b0-4a92-9198-4128ac3c26b6.png)  **Step2:** It is also the E:\xxx\taocms-3.0.2\include\Model\File.php file. It is found in line 77 that there may be an arbitrary file writing vulnerability: [e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668218/150086114-0b9f2593-0fd8-4736-bf76-070879b7a3c8.png)  The written content $\_POST['filedata'] and the written target file $this->realpath (mentioned above) are all controllable, so the data packet is constructed and written to the webshell: [f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668218/150086144-ea2922db-6943-4f1e-8ce7-327aee1e057d.png)  Successful connection to webshell [g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668218/150086152-f13f5252-f42d-414d-9baf-4b4750d0f711.png) [h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668218/150086157-d12fd9bd-f585-4a7a-b64f-d447c536f4df.png) |
