Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly delete the connection password when the TeamViewer for Linux process crashes. This means that the password might remain stored in memory or a temporary location, even after a crash event.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Password Deletion:** The primary weakness is the incomplete deletion of the connection password after a process crash.
- **Password Reuse:** The stored password can be reused to establish a connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Remote Access:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to establish a remote connection to the affected system by reusing the undeleted connection password.
- **Integrity and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates high impact on integrity and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Process Crash:** The attacker needs to be aware of or trigger a TeamViewer process crash.
- **Knowledge of TeamViewer ID:** The attacker must know the TeamViewer ID of the target system.
- **Password Reuse or Local Access:** The attacker needs either the pre-crash connection password or local authenticated access to the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Crash Event:** The attacker needs to be aware that a crash occurred.
- **TeamViewer ID:** The attacker must know the ID of the target system.
- **Access to Password or Local Machine:** The attacker must have either the previous connection password or local authenticated access to the machine.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects TeamViewer for Linux versions prior to 15.28.
- The issue is not exploitable if the user leverages passwordless authentication (“Easy Access”) or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- The vendor states they have no indication of active exploitation.

**CVSS Score:**

- CVSS 3.0 Base Score: 6.3 (Medium)
- CVSS Vector String: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
