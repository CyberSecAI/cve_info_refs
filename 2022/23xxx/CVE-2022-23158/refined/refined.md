- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Wyse Device Agent allows a local authenticated user with admin privileges to connect to a valid WMS server by providing incorrect port information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive data exposure vulnerability due to improper handling of port information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local authenticated user with admin privileges can potentially connect to the WMS server using incorrect port information, leading to sensitive data exposure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. The attacker must have administrative privileges on the system running the vulnerable Wyse Device Agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local, authenticated user with administrative privileges on the target system. They also need to provide incorrect port information.
