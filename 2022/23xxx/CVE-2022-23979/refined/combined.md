How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

* Verified Buyers: Make it so that only those who have purchased a product can leave a product review
* Set a minimum and/or maximum number of days after purchase a verified buyer is able to leave a review

From simple reviews, with one overall rating score, to in-depth reviews, with multiple fields and sub-ratings, you can customize Ultimate Reviews to perfectly suit your needs. All of this with multiple layout, styling and review ordering options.

The premium version includes many useful features such as:

* WooCommerce integration, including verified buyers and min/max days after purchase to leave a review
* Allow in-depth reviews and create additional review fields, such as value, appearance, quality, etc.
* Add in custom fields to the review that don’t affect the score/rating, such as text, checkbox, radio button and drop-down fields
* Rich snippets / schema structured data for individual reviews and also for aggregate ratings in the reviews summary
* Detailed, customizable HTML emails that can automatically ask for reviews of each product in a WooCommerce order
* Reviews search shortcode using AJAX, so visitors can search reviews by keyword without reloading the page
* Option to make any review field filterable (ex. What store did you visit? What size did you buy? etc.) so visitors can find the most helpful reviews for them
* Infinite scroll for reviews
* Let visitors vote reviews up or down if they find them helpful (review karma). Sort reviews by karma.
* Require reviewers to be logged in, with available login options including WordPress and the [Front-End Only Users](//wordpress.org/plugins/front-end-only-users/%E2%80%9C) plugin
* Replace “Reviews” tab on WooCommerce product page with reviews from Ultimate Reviews

## FAQ

### How do I let visitors submit reviews for a product?

You can add the shortcode [submit-review] to your page. If you only want visitors to be able to submit a review for one particular product, add the attribute “product\_name” and set it equal to the name of the product that you would like them to be able to review.

### How do I display reviews that have been submitted?

* The shortcode [ultimate-reviews] lets you display all reviews that have been created. If you only want to display reviews for one particular product, add the attribute “product\_name” and set it equal to the name of the product whose reviews you’d like to display.

### Can I redirect visitors to a thank you page after they submit a review?

* Yes, you’d just need to add the “redirect\_page” attribute to your shortcode. It would look something like: [submit-review redirect\_page=’http://www.example.com’]

### How do I manage reviews or submit my own?

* In the WordPress admin area, click on the “Reviews” menu item in the navigation bar. You can add, edit and delete reviews from there.

### How do I replace WooCommerce reviews with those from Ultimate Reviews?

* You need to set to “Yes” the “Replace WooCommerce Reviews” option, which is found in the “WooCommerce” area of the “Options” tab.

### How do I make it so that only people who have bought a product in WooCommerce can leave a review?

* You need to set to “Yes” the “Verified Buyers” option in the “WooCommerce” area of the “Options” tab. There you can also set the minimum number of days a verified buyer has to wait after making a purchase before they can review as well as the maximum number of days after a purchase that a verified buyer can leave a review.

### What are in-depth reviews?

* In-depth reviews allow you to divide your reviews into multiple sections by adding new review fields in the ‘Fields’ area of the ‘Options’ tab. Each ‘Review Line’ field has its own score input as well as the ability to turn on an explanation, which allows reviewers to elaborate on their score.

### Can I add custom fields to a review that do not affect the score?

* This is definitely possible and can also be done in the ‘Fields’ area of the ‘Options’ tab by choosing any option other than ‘Review Line’ for the ‘Type’ of field (e.g. checkbox, radio button, etc.).

### Can I restrict what visitors are allowed to review (e.g. only specific products)?

* Yes, by setting the “Restrict Product Names” option to “Yes” and/or the “Product Name Input Type” option to “Dropdown,” you can then use the “Products List” section to define the products (or anything else) that you’d like visitors to be able to review.

### How do I integrate the Ultimate Product Catalog plugin?

* You need to set the “UPCP Integration” to “Yes” and then set the “Restrict Product Names” option to “Yes” and/or the “Product Name Input Type” option to “Dropdown.” You can then also set the “Autocomplete Product Names” option to “Yes” and the name field in your review form will be automatically completed with product names from your product catalog as the user types.

### Is it possible to re-order my reviews?

* Currently you can choose between ascending or descending ordering by either Submitted Date, Rating or Review Title. You can also group your reviews by product with the ability to order them (ascending or descending) by product name.

### How do I customize the styling and layout of my reviews?

* You can customize the plugin by adding code to the “Custom CSS” box in the “Basic” area of the “Options” tab. For example to change the font of the review title, you might want to add something like:

.ewd-urp-review-title { font-family:”Palatino Linotype”, “Book Antiqua”, Palatino, serif; }

In the premium version you can choose between Standard, Thumbnail and Expandable review layouts as well as use the “Styling” area of the “Options” tab, which has a built-in color picker for color fields and more!

### What are summary statistics?

* When you choose to group your reviews by product, you can enable either full or limited summary statistics. These display at the top of the product grouping and show the average score as well as a breakdown (bar graphic and numbers) of how many ratings each score has.

### Is it possible to attach an image or video to a review.

* This is possible. Just go to the “Basic” area of the “Options” tab and set “Review Image” or “Review Video” to “Yes”.

Nothing interesting in free version. Developers trying to sell expensive premium version using this useless free version.

I can’t even try the features. He asks for money for almost everything. An add-on to avoid. This type of developers aim to create problems and find solutions.

### [crash Site](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/crash-site-5/)

[patrizio61](https://profiles.wordpress.org/patrizio61/ "Posts by patrizio61")
May 14, 2021

The site is updated with WP 5.7.2
I have two pending Ultimate Reviews updates (3.0.1 to 3.0.8) and (2.1.35 to 3.0.8). If I try to update one of the two it crashes the site (www.artnuances.com).
I tried to uninstall one of the two versions, but the result is still the same.
In the plugin section, version 2.1.35 is active, while version 3.0.1 is currently suspended.
What do you recommend?
