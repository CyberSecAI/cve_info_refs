- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a user resets their password using the password recovery functionality, existing sessions for that user account are not revoked. This applies to both frontend and backend sessions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient session expiration after password reset (CWE-613).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially maintain access to a user account even after the user has reset their password, leading to unauthorized access to data or system functionality with privileges of compromised account.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, requiring no user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to exploit the vulnerability, which might require the attacker to already have compromised the account prior to the password reset or steal the active session. The attacker could also gain access by obtaining the session token from the user before the password reset.
