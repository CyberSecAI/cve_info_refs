## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

This vulnerability is a data vulnerability, as it allows somewhere within code for users to submit paths to have the deletion of any file. Any user running commit [3fa8bbf](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/3fa8bbf237e3378090f660079eb42ab4629b4d13), [1bda8d1](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/1bda8d191652c901613378e938775ca4717b9077), [12a9590](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/12a95900d7e2b84f834fc9de8f5d3a9955261bc9), [428b361](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/428b36116139adea3b379b9a88de590e4c6b33fc), [34fb194](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/34fb194a6899181aade719ca5d81278019fbbf69), [b521636](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/b5216361f5bd6df92dd85030f9136ff424fcc5ce), [ef3583e](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/ef3583e98d728a984aadc8d3cae57c38ec0329e1), or [f5efa6a](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/f5efa6a967fbf6971c321fcc574cf431b3b4ad9f) are vulnerable.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

~~The problem has not been patched as of yet. A fix is expected in the next commit.~~ As of commit [1eb1e54](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/1eb1e5428f0926b2829a0bbbb65b0d946e608593), the issue has been patched. Any downloads of iTunesRPC-Remastered source before this commit should download the latest source ASAP.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Manual modification of source code can be efficient in remedying this issue. To fix this, you must:

1. import secure\_filename from werkzeug.utils
2. Wrap line(s) 129 `remove(filename)` in secure\_filename to change the line to `remove(secure_filename(filename))`

### CWEs

CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal

CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal

CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path

CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
