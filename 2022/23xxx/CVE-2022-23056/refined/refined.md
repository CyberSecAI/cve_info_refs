  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2022-23056": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the 'surgical history' field within the Patient History page of ERPNext. It fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "A low-privileged user can conduct an account takeover attack by injecting malicious JavaScript code that, when viewed by an administrator, steals the administrator's session cookie.",
       "attack_vector": "Network",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A low-privilege user (e.g., physician) can create a new patient record and inject the malicious script into the 'surgical history' field. An administrator must then view the patient history to trigger the exploit.",
       "required_attacker_position": "The attacker needs access to the ERPNext application to create a new patient entry with the malicious payload. They also require a separate server to host the malicious script."
