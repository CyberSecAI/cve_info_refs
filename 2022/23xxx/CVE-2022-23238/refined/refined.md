Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a firewall issue in Linux deployments of StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) when running on a Linux kernel version less than 4.7.0. This suggests that the affected versions of StorageGRID do not properly restrict access to specific services or ports when running on older kernels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue is a lack of proper access control, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities on TCP ports 3000, 9090 and 9093.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can view limited metrics information.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker can add or modify alert email recipients and content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attack vector is remote, as an attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to be on the local network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is required for the attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable StorageGRID instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any specific credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) versions 11.6.0 through 11.6.0.2, when deployed on Linux with a kernel version less than 4.7.0.
*   Specifically affected Linux platforms are: Canonical Ubuntu Server 16.04, CentOS 7.9 64-bit, and RHEL Server 7.9 64-bit.

**Unaffected Products:**
* StorageGRID Appliance Nodes and VMware images are not affected.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade the Linux kernel to 4.7.0 or higher.
*   Use an external firewall to block TCP ports 3000, 9090 and 9093.
*   Apply the patch provided by NetApp, available in version 11.6.0.3 of StorageGRID.
