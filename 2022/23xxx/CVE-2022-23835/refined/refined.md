The provided content is related to CVE-2022-23835.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Visual Voice Mail (VVM) services transmit unencrypted IMAP credentials via SMS messages. This occurs when a client sends a STATUS SMS (activate, deactivate, status) request to the carrier. The carrier responds with all credentials needed to log into the IMAP server (username, password, server hostname) in an unencrypted SMS message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unencrypted transmission of sensitive VVM IMAP credentials (username and password) over SMS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who can intercept the SMS message containing the VVM IMAP credentials can gain unauthorized access to the victim's VVM data stored on the IMAP server. The attacker can access all VVMs until the user deletes it.

**Attack vectors:**
- Interception of SMS messages by:
    - Gaining temporary physical access to the SIM card
    - Operating a spoofed base station (cell tower)
    - Convincing a user to install a malicious application with SMS access

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept SMS messages. This can be achieved through various means like physical access to SIM, setting up rogue base stations, or malicious apps with SMS access.
