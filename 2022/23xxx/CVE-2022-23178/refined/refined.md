- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unauthenticated access to the web interface of the Crestron device reveals user credentials within an HTTP response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure, specifically credential disclosure. The web interface returns a username and password in plain text within a JSON response to an AJAX request made without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrative access to the device's web interface. This enables the attacker to modify input and output settings, as well as to upload and install new firmware.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the web interface of the affected device using a web browser triggers the vulnerable HTTP request. This can be done by any network user who can reach the device's web interface, without any authentication required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the Crestron device's web interface. No special privileges or authentication are needed.
