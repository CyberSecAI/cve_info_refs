We are cleaning up the memory in `decode` and then we are using an `OP_REQUIRES` to check an invariant on the `decode` data.

# Use after free in `DecodePng` kernel

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-24x4-6qmh-88qg
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

A malicious user can cause a use after free behavior when [decoding PNG images](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/decode_image_op.cc#L339-L346):

```
if (/* ... error conditions ... */) {
  png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode);
  OP_REQUIRES(context, false,
              errors::InvalidArgument("PNG size too large for int: ",
                                      decode.width, " by ", decode.height));
}
```

After `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)` gets called, the values of `decode.width` and `decode.height` are in an unspecified state.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e746adbfcfee15e9cfdb391ff746c765b99bdf9b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e746adbfcfee15e9cfdb391ff746c765b99bdf9b).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23584
