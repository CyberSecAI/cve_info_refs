# DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) in teler dashboard

Low

[dwisiswant0](/dwisiswant0)
published
GHSA-xr7p-8q82-878q
Dec 6, 2022

## Package

gomod

teler.app
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= v2.0.0-rc, <= v2.0.0-rc.3
v2.0.0-dev

## Patched versions

v2.0.0-rc.4
v2.0.0-dev.2

## Description

### Description

teler prior to version <= 2.0.0-rc.4 is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) in the teler dashboard. When teler requests messages from the event stream on the `/events` endpoint, the log data displayed on the dashboard are not sanitized.

### Impact

This only affects authenticated users and can only be exploited based on detected threats if the log contains a DOM scripting payload. This indicates a low severity and there is no significant impact on the users.

### Affected Version

This issue was introduced from version `v2.0.0-rc` to `v2.0.0-rc.3` & `v2.0.0-dev`.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been fixed on version `v2.0.0-rc.4` & `v2.0.0-dev.2`.

### Workarounds

Here are some workarounds to handle this case:

* Deactivate the live event dashboard from the configuration file, or
* Upgrade teler version to `v2.0.0-rc.4` or `v2.0.0-dev.2` & above.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
