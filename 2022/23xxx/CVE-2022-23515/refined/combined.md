Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3565-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : ruby-loofah
Version        : 2.2.3-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-23514 CVE-2022-23515 CVE-2022-23516
Debian Bug     : 1026083

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Loofah, a Ruby library for
HTML/XML transformation and sanitization. An attacker could launch
cross-site scripting (XSS) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through
crafted HTML/XML documents.

CVE-2022-23514

    Inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive
    backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG
    attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU
    resource consumption.

CVE-2022-23515

    Cross-site scripting via the image/svg+xml media type in data
    URIs.

CVE-2022-23516

    Loofah uses recursion for sanitizing CDATA sections, making it
    susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a SystemStackError
    exception. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU
    resource consumption.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.3-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-loofah packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-loofah please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-loofah>

| I just posted [this issue at the Rails HTML Sanitizer repo](https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/issues/51), but after testing I realized that it goes wrong inside Loofah itself.   ---   This is the problem: When I sanitize a HTML string with an image whose src points to a data URI, its src attribute is removed (even when src is whitelisted):  ``` unclean_html = "A test <img src=\"http://placehold.it/400x300\"> <img src='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=='/>"  clean_html = Loofah.fragment(unclean_html).scrub!(:strip).to_s clean_html # => "A test\n    <img src=\"http://placehold.it/400x300\">\n    <img>"  ```  I presume that this happens because of too strict JS-prevention measures (or the data-URI is just discarded because the sanitizer does not understand the `data:` protocol?).  I hope this can be fixed. |

| [@Qqwy](https://github.com/Qqwy) can you help me understand why `data` URLs are safe and shouldn't be sanitized?  There's a workaround available, which is to wrap the URL in `url(...)`:  ``` #! /usr/bin/env ruby  require 'nokogiri' require 'loofah'  unclean_html = <<-EOHTML A test <img src=\"http://placehold.it/400x300\"> <img src='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=='/>" <img src='url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)'/>" EOHTML  clean_html = Loofah.fragment(unclean_html).scrub!(:strip).to_s puts clean_html  ```  emits  ``` A test <img src="http://placehold.it/400x300"> <img>" <img src="url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)">"  ``` |

| [@flavorjones](https://github.com/flavorjones) I had presumed that `data:` URI's were only ever able to link to 'downloadable' resources, but you made me doubt my knowledge, so I did some research. And it turns out that I am wrong, to some extent:   * IE only allows downloadable resources (images, stylesheets) anywhere. * Webkit allows `text/script` and `text/html` sources, but these are sandboxed. * If I understand it correctly, Gecko explicitly does not sandbox data URI's, although only iframes and script tags seem to be able to execute text/html and application/script resources.   (Sources: [this question on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11228771/are-data-uris-on-imgs-xss-exploitable), [RFC2397](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397), [Can I Use Data URIs](http://caniuse.com/#feat=datauri) ).  So, it seems that it indeed is *unsafe* to allow all data URIs. What seems like a better option to me, is to allow data URIs that specify one of the following media types, as script execution is impossible in them:   * `text/plain` (This is also the default, when specifying '' as content type) * `text/css` * `image/png` * `image/gif` * `image/jpeg` * `image/svg+xml` (This is safe as in-SVG JS is only executed when the SVG is included inline as part of the document.)   *(Did I miss any important ones in above list?)*  What do you think of this proposal?  Using an `<img src="url(...)"/>` tag does not seem to work here: Webkit and Gecko both show a broken image.  [Also see my example CodePen where I tested out various variations of above stuff.](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/RaWXKz) |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
