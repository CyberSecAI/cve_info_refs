```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to execute unwanted actions by tricking authenticated users.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Impact of exploitation: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions available in the plugin.
- Attack vectors: The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into submitting it. The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the target system
