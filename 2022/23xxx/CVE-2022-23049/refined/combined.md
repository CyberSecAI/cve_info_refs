| As stated on our obsolete bug reporting site (Lighthouse), the XSS Settings and RCE issues only apply to Super-Admin or Admin users and users with that level of permission can do quite a bit to hack a site...However, the User-Agent issue should be addressed. |

## Exponent CMS 2.6.0 patch2 Stored Cross-Site Scripting (User-Agent)

Reported by [Oscar](/users/1060058) |
January 25th, 2022 @ 03:42 PM

### Bug description

Exponent CMS **2.6.0 patch2** allows an
authenticated user to inject Javascript code on the User-Agent when
logging in.

When an administrator user visits the 'User Sessions' tab, the
Javascript will be triggered allowing an attacker to compromise the
administrator session.

### CVSSv3 Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.4

### Steps to reproduce

1. Use a Web proxy or a tool to modify the browser User-agent with
   the following PoC.
   ```

   User-Agent: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

   ```
2. Try to login with a non-admin user.
3. If an admin user visits 'User Management' > 'User Sessions'
   page, the XSS will be triggered.

### Impact

A non-admin user may compromise an admin session by exploiting
this vulnerability.

disclosure policy.
