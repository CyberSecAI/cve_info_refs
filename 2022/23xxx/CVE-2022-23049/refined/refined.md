**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-controlled input within the User-Agent HTTP header before storing and displaying it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A non-admin user can inject malicious JavaScript code into the User-Agent field when logging in.

- The attacker uses a web proxy or similar tool to inject the malicious User-Agent when logging in as a non-admin user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (non-admin) of the application.
