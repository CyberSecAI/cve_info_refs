Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-23105:

**Root Cause:**
The Active Directory Plugin versions 2.25 and earlier do not encrypt the transmission of data between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers by default. It only encrypts the transmission if configured to use the OS-agnostic LDAP mode with the system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` set to `true`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Plaintext Credential Transmission:**  User credentials and potentially other sensitive credentials (manager DN for LDAP mode, Windows/AD user for ADSI mode) are transmitted in plaintext over the network if TLS/SSL is not explicitly configured or enforced.
- **Lack of Default Encryption:** The plugin does not enforce encryption by default for communication with Active Directory servers, leaving it vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** Attackers who can capture network traffic between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers can obtain the credentials of users logging into Jenkins, as well as credentials of the manager DN (LDAP mode) or the Windows/Active Directory user Jenkins is running as (ADSI mode). This can lead to unauthorized access to Jenkins and potentially the wider network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Traffic Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the network between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers can intercept and read the plaintext credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to monitor or intercept network traffic between the Jenkins controller and the Active Directory server.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack can occur passively by observing network traffic, no user interaction or specific permissions are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory highlights that the fix introduces an option to only connect to Active Directory via TLS/SSL in both ADSI and LDAP modes, which is enabled by default for new installations.
-  Upgrading administrators are warned to update plugin configuration.
-  The plugin provides configuration options to enforce TLS/SSL via system properties `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationProvider.ADSI_FLAGS_OVERRIDE` and `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationProvider.ADSI_PASSWORDLESS_FLAGS_OVERRIDE`.
