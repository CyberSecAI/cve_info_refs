### CVE-2022-23078
The provided content relates to CVE-2022-23078.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `redirectTo` parameter in the login page of Habitica.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to an open redirect. Specifically, the application does not properly validate or sanitize the `redirectTo` parameter, allowing an attacker to control the redirect URL after a successful login.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to redirect a user to an arbitrary, potentially malicious website after the user logs into Habitica. This can be leveraged for phishing attacks, or to deliver malware, among other things.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing a `redirectTo` parameter. This URL can be disseminated through various means, such as phishing emails, or via social media.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a `redirectTo` parameter. The attacker does not need access to the application, just the ability to trick a user into clicking on the crafted link and logging into the application.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Habitica versions v4.119.0 through v4.232.2.
*   The fix is to upgrade to version v4.233.0.
