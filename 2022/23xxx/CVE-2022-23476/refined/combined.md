# Unchecked return value from xmlTextReaderExpand

High

[flavorjones](/flavorjones)
published
GHSA-qv4q-mr5r-qprj
Dec 8, 2022

## Package

bundler

nokogiri
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

1.13.8, 1.13.9

## Patched versions

1.13.10

## Description

## Summary

Nokogiri `1.13.8, 1.13.9` fails to check the return value from `xmlTextReaderExpand` in the method `Nokogiri::XML::Reader#attribute_hash`. This can lead to a null pointer exception when invalid markup is being parsed.

For applications using `XML::Reader` to parse untrusted inputs, this may potentially be a vector for a denial of service attack.

## Mitigation

Upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.10`.

Users may be able to search their code for calls to either `XML::Reader#attributes` or `XML::Reader#attribute_hash` to determine if they are affected.

## Severity

The Nokogiri maintainers have evaluated this as [High Severity 7.5 (CVSS3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).

## References

* [CWE - CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value (4.9)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/252.html)
* [CWE - CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (4.9)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

```
Note that on JRuby, the namespaces are still returned because the
parse error would raised on the subsequent node expansion.

This restores the behavior from v1.13.7
