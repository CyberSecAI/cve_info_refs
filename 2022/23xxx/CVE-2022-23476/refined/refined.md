{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the return value of `xmlTextReaderExpand` within the `Nokogiri::XML::Reader#attribute_hash` method.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value",
      "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Failure to check the return value of `xmlTextReaderExpand` can result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker could exploit this by providing crafted or invalid XML markup, forcing the `xmlTextReaderExpand` to return NULL, ultimately leading to the crash of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker can send malicious XML input to an application that is using `Nokogiri::XML::Reader` to parse XML data from untrusted sources.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send a request containing the malicious XML.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs specifically when parsing invalid XML markup. The fix involves explicitly checking if the `xmlTextReaderExpand` returns `NULL` and, if so, returning `nil` to avoid the null pointer dereference. The vulnerability is present in Nokogiri versions 1.13.8 and 1.13.9, and fixed in 1.13.10. The vulnerability affects CRuby, JRuby is not vulnerable because the parse error is raised on the subsequent node expansion."
