Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-23080:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied URLs in the media upload functionality of Directus. This insufficient validation allows an attacker to manipulate the URL used for importing media, leading to server-side request forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the provided URL before making a request to it. This allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Internal Network Port Scans:** A low-privileged user can exploit this SSRF vulnerability to perform internal network port scans. This means an attacker can determine which services are running on internal network hosts by observing the response times of requests to various ports, if any. This could expose the internal network infrastructure and services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the media upload functionality, specifically when importing a file from a URL. An attacker provides a malicious URL via the "import file from URL" feature, causing the server to make requests to the specified destination.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low Privileged User:** The attacker only needs a low-privileged user account to exploit this vulnerability. This makes it easier for an attacker to gain the necessary access.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application. This usually means being able to send HTTP requests to the application's web server.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected versions:** Directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are affected.
- **Patch:** Upgrading to Directus version 9.7.0 or later will remediate this vulnerability.
- **Technical Details:** The Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can use this vulnerability to probe internal network ports. By observing the server response time when sending requests to a given port, they can determine if that port is open or closed, revealing active internal services.
- The fix introduced an `IMPORT_IP_DENY_LIST` to block importing files from denied IP addresses including local ones.
