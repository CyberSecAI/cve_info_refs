Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23632:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-23632. The GitHub security advisory (GHSA-hrhx-6h34-j5hc) explicitly mentions this CVE ID. Additionally, the description in the advisory aligns with the fix described in the pull request #8764, which is about a flaw in how TLS configurations were selected.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stemmed from an issue in Traefik's TLS configuration choice logic. When a request used a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that was handled by a router with a dedicated TLS configuration, the TLS selection logic could fall back to the default configuration, which might not be the intended one. If CNAME flattening was enabled, the SNI TLS configuration was used while routing used CNAME value which skipped the expected configuration.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect TLS configuration selection:** The logic for choosing the correct TLS configuration based on the hostname was flawed.
    *   **Bypass of router-specific TLS settings:**  Requests using FQDNs could bypass the dedicated TLS configurations set on routers.
    *   **Impact of CNAME Flattening:** CNAME flattening resulted in TLS configurations being skipped.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** This vulnerability could lead to the use of an incorrect TLS configuration, potentially resulting in:
    *   Exposure of sensitive data if the default TLS configuration is less secure or incompatible with the client requirements.
    *   Disruption of mTLS setup, which requires specific TLS settings.
    *   Bypassing the intended mTLS configuration and allowing connections to be established without proper authentication or encryption as intended.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network requests with FQDN:** Sending a request to Traefik using an FQDN that is handled by a router that was set with specific TLS configurations.
    *   **Requests with CNAME Flattening:** If CNAME flattening is enabled, the vulnerability is easily triggerable by sending the request to the CNAME record.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker would need to send requests to a Traefik instance.
    *   The attacker needs to know or guess FQDNs that are configured in the Traefik routing system with dedicated TLS configurations.
    *   The attacker could also send requests using a CNAME if CNAME flattening was enabled.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The issue was fixed in Traefik v2.6.1.
*   The vulnerability is labeled as "High" severity.
*   A workaround was available for cases without CNAME flattening enabled which is adding the FDQN to the host rule.
*   The pull request ([#8764](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/8764)) that fixed this vulnerability was merged on Feb 10, 2022. The fix was to apply the same approach as the rules system on the TLS configuration choice.
*   The vulnerability was reported by bawolff.

**4. Oracle CPU:**

The Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022 mentions CVE-2022-23632 as affecting Oracle Communications Unified Inventory Management, indicating it's a vulnerability not just in the standalone Traefik project. The provided text from the Oracle document does not offer specific details about this vulnerability other than the products affected which is Oracle Communications Unified Inventory Management version 7.5.0.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-23632 is a high-severity vulnerability in Traefik (and also impacts Oracle Communications Unified Inventory Management) that can cause incorrect TLS configurations to be used, potentially compromising security and availability. The vulnerability is triggered by specific request patterns involving FQDNs and can bypass intended mTLS setups. The fix in Traefik v2.6.1 addresses this flaw by ensuring consistent TLS configuration choices based on the rules system.
