## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `Range` suffers from integer overflows. These can trigger undefined behavior or, in some scenarios, extremely large allocations.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f0147751fd5d2ff23251149ebad9af9f03010732](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f0147751fd5d2ff23251149ebad9af9f03010732) (merging [#51733](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51733)).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# Integer overflow in Range resulting in undefined behavior and OOM

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-qx3f-p745-w4hr
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `Range` suffers from integer overflows. These can trigger undefined behavior or, in some scenarios, extremely large allocations.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f0147751fd5d2ff23251149ebad9af9f03010732](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f0147751fd5d2ff23251149ebad9af9f03010732) (merging [#51733](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51733)).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported externally via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/52676).

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23562

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

## Description

![@elfringham](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10442001?v=4&size=48)[elfringham](https://github.com/elfringham)opened [on Oct 26, 2021](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/52676#issue-1036189142)

*Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our

[GitHub Policy](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/ISSUES.md),

we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and

build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug\_template*

**System information**

* Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
* OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): all
* Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: n/a
* TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
* TensorFlow version (use command below): git HEAD
* Python version: 3.6.8
* Bazel version (if compiling from source): 3.7.2
* GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 10.3.0
* CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
* GPU model and memory: n/a

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture

[script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh)

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

1. TF 1.0: `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"`
2. TF 2.0: `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"`

**Describe the current behavior**

[tensorflow/tensorflow/core/ops/math\_ops.cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0b67dee3f02e2e055230ca6dd6cc7d090af72baa/tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc#L1484)

[0b67dee](/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0b67dee3f02e2e055230ca6dd6cc7d090af72baa)

|  | c->set\_output(0, c->Vector(static\_cast<int64\_t>(size))); |
| --- | --- |

has undefined behaviour when size is greater than std::numeric\_limits<int64\_t>::max()

This leads to the unit test RangeTest.testLargeStarts failing on AARCH64 where the g++ implements different behaviour from x86. On x86 the result of the cast is large and -ve, on AARCH64 it is large and +ve. Neither is incorrect as the behaviour of casting into a type that cannot hold the value is undefined.

**Describe the expected behavior**

The code should be written to avoid relying on undefined behaviour of the source.

**[Contributing](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute)**

* Do you want to contribute a PR? (yes/no): yes
* Briefly describe your candidate solution(if contributing):

Test the variable 'size' for exceeding the greatest possible value that can be safely cast to int64\_t and throw an error if found.

**Standalone code to reproduce the issue**

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate

the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.

$ bazel test --flaky\_test\_attempts=3 --test\_output=all --cache\_test\_results=no --remote\_http\_cache="" --remote\_cache\_proxy="" --noremote\_accept\_cached --config=nonccl --verbose\_failures -- //tensorflow/python/kernel\_tests:init\_ops\_test

**Other info / logs** Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to

diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full

traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
