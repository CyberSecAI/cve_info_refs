  "CVE-2022-23066": {
    "Description": "In Solana rBPF versions 0.2.26 and 0.2.27 are affected by Incorrect Calculation which is caused by improper implementation of sdiv instruction. This can lead to the wrong execution path, resulting in huge loss in specific cases. For example, the result of a sdiv instruction may decide whether to transfer tokens or not. The vulnerability affects both integrity and may cause serious availability problems.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `sdiv32` instruction, intended for signed 32-bit division, does not correctly sign-extend the 32-bit result to 64-bit when JIT compiled, leading to incorrect results.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect Calculation",
      "Improper implementation of sdiv instruction",
      "The sdiv instruction does not consider the signed bit while extending from 32 bit to 64 bit in JIT mode."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The incorrect calculation can lead to the wrong execution path of a smart contract, potentially causing:\n\n*   Incorrect transfer of tokens or assets.\n*   Serious availability problems.\n*   Integrity issues with data and program execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Executing a smart contract that contains the sdiv32 instruction",
       "The vulnerability is triggered during the JIT compilation of the smart contract code, which is used by most validators on the Solana network."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to deploy a smart contract containing the vulnerable `sdiv32` instruction to exploit this flaw."
