  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The jsonwebtoken library versions <=8.5.1 could be misconfigured to use legacy, insecure key types for signature verification. For example, DSA keys could be used with the RS256 algorithm.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted key type usage."
    ],
    "impact": "The use of insecure key types could lead to signature verification bypass.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a JWT with an insecure key type that would be incorrectly validated by a vulnerable system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to generate a JWT and have the target system process it. No particular privileges are mentioned, other than being able to provide a JWT for verification."

  "affected_versions": "<=8.5.1",
  "patched_versions": "9.0.0",
    "fix": "The fix is to update to version 9.0.0. This version validates for asymmetric key type and algorithm combinations. Please refer to the above mentioned algorithm / key type combinations for the valid secure configuration. After updating to version 9.0.0, If you still intend to continue with signing or verifying tokens using invalid key type/algorithm value combinations, youâ€™ll need to set the `allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option to `true` in the `sign()` and/or `verify()` functions."
