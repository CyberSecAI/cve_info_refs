The provided content describes a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability in CMS Made Simple version 2.2.15, related to the upload avatar function. However, the CVE ID provided, CVE-2022-23906, is a placeholder, so the content likely does not relate to that specific CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the combination of insecure file upload handling and a copy function within the file manager. Specifically, the system allows a user to upload an image file containing malicious PHP code, and then use a 'copy' function to change the file extension to .php, thereby allowing execution of the embedded PHP code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system does not properly sanitize or validate uploaded files, allowing a user to upload a file containing malicious PHP code disguised as an image.
*   **Insecure Copy Function:** The 'copy' function allows an attacker to arbitrarily rename an uploaded image file to a PHP file, bypassing the intended restrictions on executable files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the CMS Made Simple admin interface, specifically the file manager module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have administrative access to the CMS Made Simple installation.
*   The attacker needs the ability to upload files via the file manager and have the ability to use the 'copy' functionality within the file manager.
