Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-23947:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `DCodeNumber` function of the KiCad EDA software. This function is used when parsing Gerber and Excellon files, specifically when processing D-code numbers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `DCodeNumber` function allocates a 1024-byte buffer (`line`) on the stack. It then reads characters from the input text into this buffer without checking if the buffer's bounds are exceeded.
- **Unbounded Input:** The `DCodeNumber` function reads from input controlled by the attacker. The input data that is read into the `line` buffer consists of characters considered to be numbers according to `IsNumber` definition (`0-9`, `-`, `+`, `.`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** By providing a specially crafted Gerber or Excellon file with a long sequence of characters, an attacker can overwrite stack memory, which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Gerber/Excellon files:** An attacker can craft a malicious Gerber or Excellon file that, when opened by a user in KiCad's Gerber Viewer, will trigger the overflow.
- The `DCodeNumber` function can be reached via both Gerber and Excellon parsing routines. Specifically, `GERBER_FILE_IMAGE::LoadGerberFile` calls `DCodeNumber` when a line starts with a `D` character. Also, `EXCELLON_IMAGE::LoadFile` will call the `DCodeNumber` function when parsing the T-code in the Excellon file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation:** Attackers need to be able to create or modify Gerber or Excellon files.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file in the KiCad Gerber Viewer (`gerbview`).

**Additional Details:**
- The `GCodeNumber` function has a similar vulnerability (CVE-2022-23946) that exists due to the same lack of bounds checking when parsing G-code numbers.
- The vulnerability exists in KiCad EDA version 6.0.1 and prior, as well as master commit de006fc010.
- The vulnerable function `DCodeNumber` is also used by the `TCodeNumber` function in Excellon parsing.
- The overflow occurs because the `line` buffer is smaller than the input `Text` buffer and the loop that writes to `line` does not check if it is within the `line` buffer's bounds.
