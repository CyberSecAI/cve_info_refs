- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in Kibana that exposes sensitive information related to Elastic Stack monitoring in the Kibana page source. This occurs when Kibana is configured as a remote UI for Elastic Stack Monitoring using the `monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.*` settings. The same vulnerability also exposes other non-sensitive application-internal information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure, specifically sensitive information related to Elastic Stack monitoring and other non-sensitive application-internal data.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Exposure of sensitive information regarding Elastic Stack monitoring. This includes information about the health and performance of the Elasticsearch cluster.
    - Exposure of other non-sensitive application-internal information.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing the page source of a vulnerable Kibana instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, the attacker only needs to be able to view the page source of the Kibana instance.
