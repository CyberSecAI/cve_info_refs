Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from direct string concatenation of user-supplied parameter names into SQL queries within the `net/mingsoft/cms/action/web/MCmsAction.java` file. Specifically, the application does not filter or sanitize the `filed` parameter, leading to injection.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input, specifically parameter names.
- **Direct String Concatenation:** The vulnerable code directly concatenates user-controlled input with SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to extract sensitive information, modify or delete data, and potentially gain control of the database server.
- **Remote code execution:** While the primary issue is SQL injection, there is a comment "好家伙，远程执行代码漏洞" which translates to "Good guy, remote code execution vulnerability". This suggests a potential for further exploitation beyond SQL injection, although the specific details of the RCE are not provided.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts malicious HTTP GET requests to the `/mcms/search.do` endpoint, injecting SQL code into the `filed` parameter. For example `GET /mcms/search.do?1'=0000 HTTP/1.1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's web server.
- Knowledge of the target application's endpoint (`/mcms/search.do`) and the vulnerable parameter (`filed`) is necessary for successful exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes an example of a time-based blind SQL injection using `sleep()`, demonstrating how an attacker can exfiltrate data.
- The attacker used a Python script for automated exploitation by using a dictionary to perform the time based sql injection.
- The application version is specified as MCMS 5.2.5, which aids in identifying vulnerable versions.

This detailed breakdown goes beyond the generic CVE description and provides a clear understanding of the root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors, and required attacker capabilities of this SQL injection vulnerability.
