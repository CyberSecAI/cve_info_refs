Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-23645:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the header size indicator within the swtpm state data. The `hdrsize` field in the `blobheader` was not validated against the expected size of the header structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** A specially crafted header with an invalid `hdrsize` value could lead to an out-of-bounds read when the state data is accessed, because the code would try to read past the actual header, into the blob data.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code failed to validate the `hdrsize` field against the expected header size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The out-of-bounds access can result in a crash of the swtpm application.
- **Denial of Service:** The crash can prevent swtpm from starting, which disrupts the functionality of applications that rely on it (e.g., VMs).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted State Header:** The attack vector is a specially crafted header within the swtpm's state data. This header contains a manipulated `hdrsize` field.
- **State Loading:** When swtpm loads its state from a persistent store, it parses this header. If the header is crafted to have an invalid `hdrsize`, the vulnerability is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over State Data:** An attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate the state data that swtpm loads. This could happen if the attacker has control over the storage location of the state data, or if an application that creates the state data can be compromised.
- **No authentication needed**: The vulnerability is present during the loading of the state.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `SWTPM_NVRAM_CheckHeader` function within `src/swtpm/swtpm_nvstore.c`.
- The fix was to add a check to verify that `hdrsize` is equal to the size of the `blobheader` struct.
- The vulnerability is present in swtpm versions 0.7.0, 0.6.1, 0.5.2 and 0.4.2, and is fixed in versions 0.7.1, 0.6.2, and 0.5.3.
