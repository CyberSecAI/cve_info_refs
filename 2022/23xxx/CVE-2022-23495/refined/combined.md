### @rvagg **[rvagg](/rvagg)** commented [Sep 28, 2022](#issue-1388950267)

Ref: [#90](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/issues/90)

When using `SetCidBuilder` you can set up for a hasher that will not be found when a `Sum()` is eventually called in `EncodeProtobuf()`, and the error from this doesn't bubble up through `RawData()`, it just panics.

So this change adds an error return to `SetCidBuilder()` *and* will fail to use the builder if it's going to result in that error. If the error isn't handled then you'll get a silent default to a (presumably) working builder. If it's checked then at least you'll have an error to bubble up to the user or some place helpful.

However, the caveat here is that we are not actually testing `Sum()` will work, only the obvious path to the error. If we are given a custom `CidBuilder` that doesn't match `Prefix`, or if there is a custom `Sum()` that doesn't use `MhType` then this isn't going to work. But I'm not sure what that situation is.

This is a soft option for dealing with [#90](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/issues/90).

Sorry, something went wrong.

This is better, now all consumers are protected to what we found in Kubo.

| [@Jorropo](https://github.com/Jorropo) got an opinion on version bump for this? I'm not really sure how a non forward-breaking in a <0 semver situation would normally be handled. In >1 I'd probably just bump minor version for this so I'm tempted to say in <0 that it's a patch bump and let static analysis pick up the change for consumers. |

| Needs to be a semver-minor bump because it's a method so it impacts the type's interface.  I'm also considering further testing that if the builder isn't a cid.Prefix running a Sum() on it with a simple value (empty byte array?) to test that it actually works. |

| [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg) I don't fully understand where is the API changing here ? Because it wouldn't work either way, before it would panic later, but now it's an error earlier. AFAIT there is no way to use this code with broken hasher, before it would panic or error when getting bytes, now it's when setting a build.  I'm also considering further testing that if the builder isn't a cid.Prefix running a Sum() on it with a simple value (empty byte array?) to test that it actually works.  Yeah, this would also work in-case a custom builder is passed, I think it's fine. |

Directed graph with no directed cycles[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Tred-G.svg/220px-Tred-G.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ATred-G.svg)

Example of a directed acyclic graph

In [mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), particularly [graph theory](/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), and [computer science](/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), a **directed acyclic graph** (**DAG**) is a [directed graph](/wiki/Directed_graph "Directed graph") with no [directed cycles](/wiki/Cycle_graph#Directed_cycle_graph "Cycle graph"). That is, it consists of [vertices](/wiki/Vertex_%28graph_theory%29 "Vertex (graph theory)") and [edges](/wiki/Edge_%28graph_theory%29 "Edge (graph theory)") (also called *arcs*), with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop. A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be [topologically ordered](/wiki/Topological_ordering "Topological ordering"), by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions. DAGs have numerous scientific and computational applications, ranging from biology (evolution, family trees, epidemiology) to information science (citation networks) to computation (scheduling).

Directed acyclic graphs are also called **acyclic directed graphs**[[1]](#cite_note-thul-1) or **acyclic digraphs**.[[2]](#cite_note-bang-2)

## Definitions

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Definitions")]

A [graph](/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29 "Graph (discrete mathematics)") is formed by [vertices](/wiki/Vertex_%28graph_theory%29 "Vertex (graph theory)") and by [edges](/wiki/Edge_%28graph_theory%29 "Edge (graph theory)") connecting pairs of vertices, where the vertices can be any kind of object that is connected in pairs by edges. In the case of a [directed graph](/wiki/Directed_graph "Directed graph"), each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex. A [path](/wiki/Path_%28graph_theory%29 "Path (graph theory)") in a directed graph is a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence is the same as the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph that has no cycles.[[1]](#cite_note-thul-1)[[2]](#cite_note-bang-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3)

A vertex v of a directed graph is said to be [reachable](/wiki/Reachability "Reachability") from another vertex u when there exists a path that starts at u and ends at v. As a special case, every vertex is considered to be reachable from itself (by a path with zero edges). If a vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path (a path with one or more edges), then that path is a cycle, so another way to define directed acyclic graphs is that they are the graphs in which no vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

## Mathematical properties

### Reachability relation, transitive closure, and transitive reduction

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Reachability relation, transitive closure, and transitive reduction")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Tred-G.svg/175px-Tred-G.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ATred-G.svg)A DAG[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Tred-Gprime.svg/124px-Tred-Gprime.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ATred-Gprime.svg)Its transitive reduction

The [reachability relation](/wiki/Reachability "Reachability") of a DAG can be formalized as a [partial order](/wiki/Partial_order "Partial order") ≤ on the vertices of the DAG. In this partial order, two vertices u and v are ordered as *u* ≤ *v* exactly when there exists a directed path from u to v in the DAG; that is, when u can reach v (or v is reachable from u).[[5]](#cite_note-5) However, different DAGs may give rise to the same reachability relation and the same partial order.[[6]](#cite_note-6) For example, a DAG with two edges *u* → *v* and *v* → *w* has the same reachability relation as the DAG with three edges *u* → *v*, *v* → *w*, and *u* → *w*. Both of these DAGs produce the same partial order, in which the vertices are ordered as *u* ≤ *v* ≤ *w*.

The [transitive closure](/wiki/Transitive_closure "Transitive closure") of a DAG is the graph with the most edges that has the same reachability relation as the DAG. It has an edge *u* → *v* for every pair of vertices (u, v) in the reachability relation ≤ of the DAG, and may therefore be thought of as a direct translation of the reachability relation ≤ into graph-theoretic terms. The same method of translating partial orders into DAGs works more generally: for every finite partially ordered set (*S*, ≤), the graph that has a vertex for every element of S and an edge for every pair of elements in ≤ is automatically a transitively closed DAG, and has (*S*, ≤) as its reachability relation. In this way, every finite partially ordered set can be represented as a DAG.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg/300px-Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3AHasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg)

A [Hasse diagram](/wiki/Hasse_diagram "Hasse diagram") representing the partial order of set inclusion (⊆) among the subsets of a three-element set

The [transitive reduction](/wiki/Transitive_reduction "Transitive reduction") of a DAG is the graph with the fewest edges that has the same reachability relation as the DAG. It has an edge *u* → *v* for every pair of vertices (u, v) in the [covering relation](/wiki/Covering_relation "Covering relation") of the reachability relation ≤ of the DAG. It is a subgraph of the DAG, formed by discarding the edges *u* → *v* for which the DAG also contains a longer directed path from u to v.
Like the transitive closure, the transitive reduction is uniquely defined for DAGs. In contrast, for a directed graph that is not acyclic, there can be more than one minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation.[[7]](#cite_note-7) Transitive reductions are useful in visualizing the partial orders they represent, because they have fewer edges than other graphs representing the same orders and therefore lead to simpler [graph drawings](/wiki/Graph_drawing "Graph drawing"). A [Hasse diagram](/wiki/Hasse_diagram "Hasse diagram") of a partial order is a drawing of the transitive reduction in which the orientation of every edge is shown by placing the starting vertex of the edge in a lower position than its ending vertex.[[8]](#cite_note-8)

### Topological ordering

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Topological ordering")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Topological_Ordering.svg/200px-Topological_Ordering.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ATopological_Ordering.svg)A [topological ordering](/wiki/Topological_sorting "Topological sorting") of a directed acyclic graph: every [edge](/wiki/Edge_%28graph_theory%29 "Edge (graph theory)") goes from earlier in the ordering (upper left) to later in the ordering (lower right). A directed graph is acyclic if and only if it has a topological ordering.[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Transitive_Closure.svg/200px-Transitive_Closure.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ATransitive_Closure.svg)Adding the red edges to the blue directed acyclic graph produces another DAG, the [transitive closure](/wiki/Transitive_closure "Transitive closure") of the blue graph. For each red or blue edge *u* → *v*, v is [reachable](/wiki/Reachability "Reachability") from u: there exists a blue path starting at u and ending at v.

A [topological ordering](/wiki/Topological_ordering "Topological ordering") of a directed graph is an ordering of its vertices into a sequence, such that for every edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge. A graph that has a topological ordering cannot have any cycles, because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle would have to be oriented the wrong way. Therefore, every graph with a topological ordering is acyclic. Conversely, every directed acyclic graph has at least one topological ordering. The existence of a topological ordering can therefore be used as an equivalent definition of a directed acyclic graphs: they are exactly the graphs that have topological orderings.[[2]](#cite_note-bang-2)
In general, this ordering is not unique; a DAG has a unique topological ordering if and only if it has a directed path containing all the vertices, in which case the ordering is the same as the order in which the vertices appear in the path.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

The family of topological orderings of a DAG is the same as the family of [linear extensions](/wiki/Linear_extension "Linear extension") of the reachability relation for the DAG,[[10]](#cite_note-10) so any two graphs representing the same partial order have the same set of topological orders.

### Combinatorial enumeration

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Combinatorial enumeration")]

The [graph enumeration](/wiki/Graph_enumeration "Graph enumeration") problem of counting directed acyclic graphs was studied by [Robinson (1973)](#CITEREFRobinson1973).[[11]](#cite_note-enum-11)
The number of DAGs on n labeled vertices, for *n* = 0, 1, 2, 3, … (without restrictions on the order in which these numbers appear in a topological ordering of the DAG) is

1, 1, 3, 25, 543, 29281, 3781503, … (sequence [A003024](//oeis.org/A003024 "oeis:A003024") in the [OEIS](/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences")).

These numbers may be computed by the [recurrence relation](/wiki/Recurrence_relation "Recurrence relation")

[Eric W. Weisstein](/wiki/Eric_W._Weisstein "Eric W. Weisstein") conjectured,[[12]](#cite_note-12) and [McKay et al. (2004)](#CITEREFMcKayRoyleWanlessOggier2004) proved, that the same numbers count the [(0,1) matrices](/wiki/Logical_matrix "Logical matrix") for which all [eigenvalues](/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue") are positive [real numbers](/wiki/Real_number "Real number"). The proof is [bijective](/wiki/Bijective_proof "Bijective proof"): a matrix A is an [adjacency matrix](/wiki/Adjacency_matrix "Adjacency matrix") of a DAG if and only if *A* + *I* is a (0,1) matrix with all eigenvalues positive, where I denotes the [identity matrix](/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix"). Because a DAG cannot have [self-loops](/wiki/Loop_%28graph_theory%29 "Loop (graph theory)"), its adjacency matrix must have a zero diagonal, so adding I preserves the property that all matrix coefficients are 0 or 1.[[13]](#cite_note-13)

A *[polytree](/wiki/Polytree "Polytree")* (also called a *directed tree*) is a multitree formed by orienting the edges of an undirected tree.[[15]](#cite_note-15)

An *[arborescence](/wiki/Arborescence_%28graph_theory%29 "Arborescence (graph theory)")* is a polytree formed by [orienting](/wiki/Orientation_%28graph_theory%29 "Orientation (graph theory)") the edges of an undirected tree away from a particular vertex, called the *root* of the arborescence.

## Computational problems

### Topological sorting and recognition

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Topological sorting and recognition")]
Main article: [Topological sorting](/wiki/Topological_sorting "Topological sorting")

[Topological sorting](/wiki/Topological_sorting "Topological sorting") is the algorithmic problem of finding a topological ordering of a given DAG. It can be solved in [linear time](/wiki/Linear_time "Linear time").[[16]](#cite_note-clrs-16) Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex ordering directly. It maintains a list of vertices that have no incoming edges from other vertices that have not already been included in the partially constructed topological ordering; initially this list consists of the vertices with no incoming edges at all. Then, it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list to the end of the partially constructed topological ordering, and checks whether its neighbors should be added to the list. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been processed in this way.[[17]](#cite_note-j50-17) Alternatively, a topological ordering may be constructed by reversing a [postorder](/wiki/Postorder "Postorder") numbering of a [depth-first search](/wiki/Depth-first_search "Depth-first search") graph traversal.[[16]](#cite_note-clrs-16)

It is also possible to check whether a given directed graph is a DAG in linear time, either by attempting to find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid[[18]](#cite_note-18) or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.[[17]](#cite_note-j50-17)

### Construction from cyclic graphs

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Construction from cyclic graphs")]

Any undirected graph may be made into a DAG by choosing a [total order](/wiki/Total_order "Total order") for its vertices and directing every edge from the earlier endpoint in the order to the later endpoint. The resulting [orientation](/wiki/Orientation_%28graph_theory%29 "Orientation (graph theory)") of the edges is called an [acyclic orientation](/wiki/Acyclic_orientation "Acyclic orientation"). Different total orders may lead to the same acyclic orientation, so an n-vertex graph can have fewer than *n*! acyclic orientations. The number of acyclic orientations is equal to |*χ*(−1)|, where χ is the [chromatic polynomial](/wiki/Chromatic_polynomial "Chromatic polynomial") of the given graph.[[19]](#cite_note-19)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Graph_Condensation.svg/330px-Graph_Condensation.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3AGraph_Condensation.svg)

The yellow directed acyclic graph is the [condensation](/wiki/Condensation_%28graph_theory%29 "Condensation (graph theory)") of the blue directed graph. It is formed by [contracting](/wiki/Edge_contraction "Edge contraction") each [strongly connected component](/wiki/Strongly_connected_component "Strongly connected component") of the blue graph into a single yellow vertex.

Any directed graph may be made into a DAG by removing a [feedback vertex set](/wiki/Feedback_vertex_set "Feedback vertex set") or a [feedback arc set](/wiki/Feedback_arc_set "Feedback arc set"), a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is [NP-hard](/wiki/NP-hard "NP-hard") to find.[[20]](#cite_note-20) An arbitrary directed graph may also be transformed into a DAG, called its [condensation](/wiki/Condensation_%28graph_theory%29 "Condensation (graph theory)"), by [contracting](/wiki/Edge_contraction "Edge contraction") each of its [strongly connected components](/wiki/Strongly_connected_component "Strongly connected component") into a single supervertex.[[21]](#cite_note-21) When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are [empty](/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set"), and its condensation is the graph itself.

### Transitive closure and transitive reduction

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Transitive closure and transitive reduction")]

The transitive closure of a given DAG, with n vertices and m edges, may be constructed in time *O*(*mn*) by using either [breadth-first search](/wiki/Breadth-first_search "Breadth-first search") or [depth-first search](/wiki/Depth-first_search "Depth-first search") to test reachability from each vertex.[[22]](#cite_note-22) Alternatively, it can be solved in time *O*(*n**ω*) where *ω* < 2.373 is the [exponent for matrix multiplication algorithms](/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_matrix_multiplication#Matrix_multiplication_exponent "Computational complexity of matrix multiplication"); this is a theoretical improvement over the *O*(*mn*) bound for [dense graphs](/wiki/Dense_graph "Dense graph").[[23]](#cite_note-23)

In all of these transitive closure algorithms, it is possible to distinguish pairs of vertices that are reachable by at least one path of length two or more from pairs that can only be connected by a length-one path. The transitive reduction consists of the edges that form length-one paths that are the only paths connecting their endpoints. Therefore, the transitive reduction can be constructed in the same asymptotic time bounds as the transitive closure.[[24]](#cite_note-24)

### Closure problem

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Closure problem")]
Main article: [Closure problem](/wiki/Closure_problem "Closure problem")

The [closure problem](/wiki/Closure_problem "Closure problem") takes as input a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure – a set of vertices *C*, such that no edges leave *C*. The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because in this case it is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph. It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the [maximum flow problem](/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem "Maximum flow problem").[[25]](#cite_note-25)

### Path algorithms

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Path algorithms")]

Some algorithms become simpler when used on DAGs instead of general graphs, based on the principle of topological ordering. For example, it is possible to find [shortest paths](/wiki/Shortest_path "Shortest path") and [longest paths](/wiki/Longest_path_problem "Longest path problem") from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by [processing the vertices in a topological order](/wiki/Topological_sorting#Application_to_shortest_path_finding "Topological sorting"), and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via any of its incoming edges.[[26]](#cite_note-26) In contrast, for arbitrary graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as [Dijkstra's algorithm](/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm "Dijkstra's algorithm") or the [Bellman–Ford algorithm](/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm "Bellman–Ford algorithm"),[[27]](#cite_note-27) and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are [NP-hard](/wiki/NP-hard "NP-hard") to find.[[28]](#cite_note-28)

## Applications

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Applications")]
### Scheduling

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Scheduling")]

Directed acyclic graph representations of partial orderings have many applications in [scheduling](/wiki/Schedule "Schedule") for systems of tasks with ordering constraints.[[29]](#cite_note-29)
An important class of problems of this type concern collections of objects that need to be updated, such as the cells of a [spreadsheet](/wiki/Spreadsheet "Spreadsheet") after one of the cells has been changed, or the [object files](/wiki/Object_file "Object file") of a piece of computer software after its [source code](/wiki/Source_code "Source code") has been changed.
In this context, a [dependency graph](/wiki/Dependency_graph "Dependency graph") is a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. A cycle in this graph is called a [circular dependency](/wiki/Circular_dependency "Circular dependency"), and is generally not allowed, because there would be no way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle.
Dependency graphs without circular dependencies form DAGs.[[30]](#cite_note-30)

For instance, when one cell of a [spreadsheet](/wiki/Spreadsheet "Spreadsheet") changes, it is necessary to recalculate the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell.[[31]](#cite_note-hgt1181-31) Similar problems of task ordering arise in [makefiles](/wiki/Makefile "Makefile") for program compilation[[31]](#cite_note-hgt1181-31) and [instruction scheduling](/wiki/Instruction_scheduling "Instruction scheduling") for low-level computer program optimization.[[32]](#cite_note-32)

PERT chart for a project with five milestones (labeled 10–50) and six tasks (labeled A–F). There are two critical paths, ADF and BC.

A somewhat different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints is used by the [program evaluation and review technique](/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique "Program evaluation and review technique") (PERT), a method for management of large human projects that was one of the first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent [milestones](/wiki/Milestone_%28project_management%29 "Milestone (project management)") of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The [longest path](/wiki/Longest_path_problem "Longest path problem") in this DAG represents the [critical path](/wiki/Critical_path_method "Critical path method") of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.[[33]](#cite_note-33)

### Data processing networks

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Data processing networks")]

A directed acyclic graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements. In this representation, data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges.

For instance, in electronic circuit design, static [combinational logic](/wiki/Combinational_logic "Combinational logic") blocks can be represented as an acyclic system of [logic gates](/wiki/Logic_gate "Logic gate") that computes a function of an input, where the input and output of the function are represented as individual [bits](/wiki/Bit "Bit"). In general, the output of these blocks cannot be used as the input unless it is captured by a register or state element which maintains its acyclic properties.[[34]](#cite_note-34) Electronic circuit schematics either on paper or in a database are a form of directed acyclic graphs using instances or components to form a directed reference to a lower level component. Electronic circuits themselves are not necessarily acyclic or directed.

[Dataflow programming](/wiki/Dataflow_programming "Dataflow programming") languages describe systems of operations on [data streams](/wiki/Data_stream "Data stream"), and the connections between the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a [parallel algorithm](/wiki/Parallel_algorithm "Parallel algorithm") in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.[[35]](#cite_note-35)

In [compilers](/wiki/Compiler "Compiler"), straight line code (that is, sequences of statements without loops or conditional branches) may be represented by a DAG describing the inputs and outputs of each of the arithmetic operations performed within the code. This representation allows the compiler to perform [common subexpression elimination](/wiki/Common_subexpression_elimination "Common subexpression elimination") efficiently.[[36]](#cite_note-36) At a higher level of code organization, the [acyclic dependencies principle](/wiki/Acyclic_dependencies_principle "Acyclic dependencies principle") states that the dependencies between modules or components of a large software system should form a directed acyclic graph.[[37]](#cite_note-37)

[Feedforward neural networks](/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network "Feedforward neural network") are another example.

### Causal structures

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Causal structures")]
Main article: [Bayesian network](/wiki/Bayesian_network "Bayesian network")

Graphs in which vertices represent events occurring at a definite time, and where the edges always point from the early time vertex to a late time vertex of the edge, are necessarily directed and acyclic. The lack of a cycle follows because the time associated with a vertex always increases as you follow any [path](/wiki/Path_%28graph_theory%29 "Path (graph theory)") in the graph so you can never return to a vertex on a path. This reflects our natural intuition that causality means events can only affect the future, they never affect the past, and thus we have no [causal loops](/wiki/Causal_loop "Causal loop"). An example of this type of directed acyclic graph are those encountered in the [causal set approach to quantum gravity](/wiki/Causal_sets "Causal sets") though in this case the graphs considered are [transitively complete](#Transitive_closure_and_transitive_reduction). In the version history example below, each version of the software is associated with a unique time, typically the time the version was saved, committed or released. In the citation graph examples below, the documents are published at one time and can only refer to older documents.

Sometimes events are not associated with a specific physical time. Provided that pairs of events have a purely causal relationship, that is edges represent [causal relations](/wiki/Causality "Causality") between the events, we will have a directed acyclic graph.[[38]](#cite_note-38) For instance, a [Bayesian network](/wiki/Bayesian_network "Bayesian network") represents a system of probabilistic events as vertices in a directed acyclic graph, in which the likelihood of an event may be calculated from the likelihoods of its predecessors in the DAG.[[39]](#cite_note-39) In this context, the [moral graph](/wiki/Moral_graph "Moral graph") of a DAG is the undirected graph created by adding an (undirected) edge between all parents of the same vertex (sometimes called *marrying*), and then replacing all directed edges by undirected edges.[[40]](#cite_note-40) Another type of graph with a similar causal structure is an [influence diagram](/wiki/Influence_diagram "Influence diagram"), the vertices of which represent either decisions to be made or unknown information, and the edges of which represent causal influences from one vertex to another.[[41]](#cite_note-41) In [epidemiology](/wiki/Epidemiology "Epidemiology"), for instance, these diagrams are often used to estimate the expected value of different choices for intervention.[[42]](#cite_note-42)[[43]](#cite_note-pearl:95-43)

The converse is also true. That is in any application represented by a directed acyclic graph there is a causal structure, either an explicit order or time in the example or an order which can be derived from graph structure. This follows because all directed acyclic graphs have a [topological ordering](#Topological_ordering), i.e. there is at least one way to put the vertices in an order such that all edges point in the same direction along that order.

### Genealogy and version history

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Genealogy and version history")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/EgyptianPtolemies2.jpg/330px-EgyptianPtolemies2.jpg)](/wiki/File%3AEgyptianPtolemies2.jpg)

Family tree of the [Ptolemaic dynasty](/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty "Ptolemaic dynasty"), with many marriages between [close relatives](/wiki/Consanguinity "Consanguinity") causing [pedigree collapse](/wiki/Pedigree_collapse "Pedigree collapse").

[Family trees](/wiki/Family_tree "Family tree") may be seen as directed acyclic graphs, with a vertex for each family member and an edge for each parent-child relationship.[[44]](#cite_note-44) Despite the name, these graphs are not necessarily trees because of the possibility of marriages between relatives (so a child has a common ancestor on both the mother's and father's side) causing [pedigree collapse](/wiki/Pedigree_collapse "Pedigree collapse").[[45]](#cite_note-45) The graphs of [matrilineal](/wiki/Matrilineal "Matrilineal") descent (mother-daughter relationships) and [patrilineal](/wiki/Patrilineal "Patrilineal") descent (father-son relationships) are trees within this graph. Because no one can become their own ancestor, family trees are acyclic.[[46]](#cite_note-46)

The version history of a [distributed revision control](/wiki/Distributed_revision_control "Distributed revision control") system, such as [Git](/wiki/Git "Git"), generally has the structure of a directed acyclic graph, in which there is a vertex for each revision and an edge connecting pairs of revisions that were directly derived from each other. These are not trees in general due to merges.[[47]](#cite_note-47)

In many [randomized](/wiki/Randomization "Randomization") [algorithms](/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") in [computational geometry](/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry"), the algorithm maintains a *history DAG* representing the version history of a geometric structure over the course of a sequence of changes to the structure. For instance in a [randomized incremental](/wiki/Randomized_algorithm#Randomized_incremental_constructions_in_geometry "Randomized algorithm") algorithm for [Delaunay triangulation](/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation "Delaunay triangulation"), the triangulation changes by replacing one triangle by three smaller triangles when each point is added, and by "flip" operations that replace pairs of triangles by a different pair of triangles. The history DAG for this algorithm has a vertex for each triangle constructed as part of the algorithm, and edges from each triangle to the two or three other triangles that replace it. This structure allows [point location](/wiki/Point_location "Point location") queries to be answered efficiently: to find the location of a query point q in the Delaunay triangulation, follow a path in the history DAG, at each step moving to the replacement triangle that contains q. The final triangle reached in this path must be the Delaunay triangle that contains q.[[48]](#cite_note-48)

### Citation graphs

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Citation graphs")]

In a [citation graph](/wiki/Citation_graph "Citation graph") the vertices are documents with a single publication date. The edges represent the citations from the bibliography of one document to other necessarily earlier documents. The classic example comes from the citations between academic papers as pointed out in the 1965 article "Networks of Scientific Papers"[[49]](#cite_note-49) by [Derek J. de Solla Price](/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price "Derek J. de Solla Price") who went on to produce the first model of a citation network, the [Price model](/wiki/Price%27s_model "Price's model").[[50]](#cite_note-50) In this case the [citation count](/wiki/Citation_impact "Citation impact") of a paper is just the in-degree of the corresponding vertex of the citation network. This is an important measure in [citation analysis](/wiki/Citation_analysis "Citation analysis"). [Court judgements](/wiki/Judgment_%28law%29 "Judgment (law)") provide another example as judges support their conclusions in one case by recalling other earlier decisions made in previous cases. A final example is provided by patents which must refer to earlier [prior art](/wiki/Prior_art "Prior art"), earlier patents which are relevant to the current patent claim. By taking the special properties of directed acyclic graphs into account, one can analyse citation networks with techniques not available when analysing the general graphs considered in many studies using [network analysis](/wiki/Network_Science "Network Science"). For instance [transitive reduction](#Transitive_closure_and_transitive_reduction) gives new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications highlighting clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts.[[51]](#cite_note-51) Another technique is [main path analysis](/wiki/Main_path_analysis "Main path analysis"), which traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given [citation graph](/wiki/Citation_graph "Citation graph").

The [Price model](/wiki/Price%27s_model "Price's model") is too simple to be a realistic model of a [citation network](/wiki/Citation_graph "Citation graph") but it is simple enough to allow for analytic solutions for some of its properties. Many of these can be found by using results derived from the undirected version of the [Price model](/wiki/Price%27s_model "Price's model"), the [Barabási–Albert model](/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model "Barabási–Albert model"). However, since [Price's model](/wiki/Price%27s_model "Price's model") gives a directed acyclic graph, it is a useful model when looking for analytic calculations of properties unique to directed acyclic graphs. For instance,
the length of the longest path, from the n-th node added to the network to the first node in the network, scales as[[52]](#cite_note-ECV-52)

### Data compression

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Directed_acyclic_graph&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Data compression")]

Directed acyclic graphs may also be used as a [compact representation](/wiki/Data_compression "Data compression") of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the [directed acyclic word graph](/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton "Deterministic acyclic finite state automaton") is a [data structure](/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure") in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of [strings](/wiki/String_%28computer_science%29 "String (computer science)"), such as English words.[[53]](#cite_note-53) Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a [trie](/wiki/Trie "Trie"). A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.[[54]](#cite_note-54)

The same idea of using a DAG to represent a family of paths occurs in the [binary decision diagram](/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram "Binary decision diagram"),[[55]](#cite_note-55)[[56]](#cite_note-56) a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled by the name of a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any [truth assignment](/wiki/Truth_assignment "Truth assignment") to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs can be viewed as a compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of [decision trees](/wiki/Decision_tree "Decision tree") that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.[[57]](#cite_note-57)

### Description

Hello! :)

I'm experimenting a bit with more exotic hash functions and `ipfs add`.

For that, I'm adding some ~5MiB binary via `ipfs add --only-hash --cid-version 1 --hash <hash function> <file>`

It's not clear from the documentation which functions are supported, but a quick skim through the source led to [`go-multihash/Names`](https://github.com/multiformats/go-multihash/blob/v0.2.1/multihash.go#L97), and indeed these are accepted by the client (and daemon, I guess).

This all works for normal hash functions (SHA2, SHA3, ...), but behaves weirdly for more exotic ones.

* `poseidon-bls12_381-a2-fc1`, `x11`, `sha2-256-trunc254-padded`, with a running daemon causes `Error: write tcp 127.0.0.1:45460->127.0.0.1:5001: write: connection reset by peer` on the CLI, and the daemon panics:

```
Daemon is ready

goroutine 144031 [running]:

```

Trying again then panics the client:

```

```

* `murmur3-x64-64` and `md5` return `Error: potentially insecure hash functions not allowed`, which is surprising seeing how SHA1 is accepted, maybe. This is mostly fine, but it looks like I'm streaming some of the data to the daemon, it's starting to chunk, and then decides "no, I won't give you the CID".

## Expected Behavior

* Some documentation as to what functions are accepted by `ipfs add`
* Not panicking the daemon

# ProtoNode may be modified such that common method calls may panic

Moderate

[rvagg](/rvagg)
published
GHSA-x39j-h85h-3f46
Dec 8, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

> 0.4.0, < 0.8.1

## Patched versions

0.8.1

## Description

### Impact

A `ProtoNode` may be modified in such a way as to cause various encode errors which will trigger a panic on common method calls that don't allow for error returns.

A `ProtoNode` should only be able to encode to valid DAG-PB, attempting to encode invalid DAG-PB forms will result in an error from the codec. Manipulation of an existing (newly created or decoded) `ProtoNode` using the modifier methods did not account for certain states that would place the `ProtoNode` into an unencodeable form.

Due to conformance with the [`github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block) and [`github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node) interfaces, certain methods, which internally require a re-encode if state has changed, will panic due to the inability to return an error.

Additionally, use of the `ProtoNode#SetCidBuilder()` method to set a non-functioning `CidBuilder` (such as one that refers to a multihash where an implementation of that hash function is not available) may cause the same methods to panic as a new CID is required but cannot be created.

### Patches

Releases involving fixes for this issue are [v0.8.0](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/releases/tag/v0.8.0) and [v0.8.1](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/releases/tag/v0.8.1). The recommended minimum version is **v0.8.1**.

* Additional checks are performed on `ProtoNode` state changes to avoid the possibility of creating unencodeable forms, errors are returned where this is the case.
* The builder passed in to `SetCidBuilder()` is inspected to attempt to determine if it is usable to generate CIDs, otherwise an error is returned.
* The panics have been removed and replaced with default values (empty byte slice for `RawData()` and a default zero-bytes DAG-PB CID for methods involving CIDs).

### Workarounds

These workarounds are available when using impacted versions to avoid panic conditions, and may be generally appropriate in order to provide meaningful feedback to users and avoid generating bad, or unexpected encoded data:

* Sanitise inputs when allowing user-input to set a new `CidBuilder` on a `ProtoNode`.
* Sanitise `Tsize` (`Link#Size`) values such that they are a reasonable byte-size for sub-DAGs where derived from user-input.

## What's Changed

* feat: check that the CidBuilder hasher is usable by [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg) in [#91](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/pull/91)
* feat: check links on setting and sanitise on encoding by [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg) in [#92](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/pull/92)

**Breaking** API changes in this release are the addition of `error` returns which should be checked:

* `(*ProtoNode).SetCidBuilder`: changed from `func(github.com/ipfs/go-cid.Builder)` to `func(github.com/ipfs/go-cid.Builder) error`
* `(*ProtoNode).SetLinks`: changed from `func([]*github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format.Link)` to `func([]*github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format.Link) error`

Additional errors may be returned on `ProtoNode` state change operations where those changes may put the `ProtoNode` instance into an unencodable state.

**Full Changelog**: [v0.7.0...v0.8.0](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0)

## Description

![@Jorropo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24391983?u=c6a3d785eb645ac9623c6d5766209d7583762fc9&v=4&size=48)[Jorropo](https://github.com/Jorropo)opened [on Sep 27, 2022](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/issues/90#issue-1388507087)

Where this was found: [ipfs/kubo#9297](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9297)

`(*ProtoNode).RawData` use incorrectly panics, there are cases where consumers can because of bad options trigger an error.

My dumb first instict would be to make it return `([]byte, error)` but AFAIT this is trying to fit an interface so we can't do this.

I guess the alternative is to do the serialisation in the write functions (which do return errors) and save the serialised bytes instead.

### @rvagg **[rvagg](/rvagg)** commented [Oct 31, 2022](#issue-1429756128)

If you don't use something derived from a cid.Prefix then it'll test execute your hasher to make sure it doesn't error.

The reason for this is to avoid more cases where a panic could occur when encoding a ProtoNode.

Sorry, something went wrong.

In addition to the changes suggested to checking `Sum`, should we also sanity check values returned by `GetCodec` and `WithCodec`? Is there a fixed set of codecs/behaviours we expect the builder to provide when those two functions are called?

If so, let's assert those too while at it.

Sorry, something went wrong.

+1 to [@Jorropo](https://github.com/Jorropo)'s suggestion on using an array here.

Thinking out loud I also wonder if we can do better:

*Disclaimer: I am not fully familiar with how this API is used.*

We could get the digest value back, read the multihash code from the beginning and call `checkHasher` function from my earlier suggestion to see if the multi hash code fits?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@Jorropo](https://github.com/Jorropo) [@masih](https://github.com/masih) see second-to-latest commit incorporating feedback ([d910fbc](https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/commit/d910fbc23f1b9bd5e924769bc4aeaed02302accb)).  The latest commit is not essential and I'd really like feedback on this one before we go ahead with it—I've entirely removed the `panic()` possibilities in that commit, returning default values. The reason this is less than ideal is because the default values don't relate to the input data, they're just zero-blocks and zero-CIDs, so the error is hidden. The docs tell you how to do it "better" but I doubt that path will be used. But since we can't error on these APIs, perhaps default values are better than panics.   ---   Some more discussion on `SetCidBuilder` and how rigorous we should be: this is, and should remain (I think) a flexible extension point for this API. Mostly we expect to receive a straightforward factory that can generate CIDs for us; but we should allow for some flexibility in what users might plug in here. An obvious example is the `InlineBuilder` which can come in various forms—it has conditional logic internally that will return a different type of multihash depending on what it's fed—by default it looks at the length to make that decision but that length is determined by the user and we see various sizes used in practice. It's also conceivable that there are use-cases where other conditional logic may inform different outputs and I don't think we should be too restrictive here in what we expect to be used.  With that in mind, we *could* go ahead and check the output of a `Sum` to make sure it's what we expect, but as long as we're doing that then we may as well remove the ability to set a custom builder and just make them set a hasher and CID version and do it ourselves; which removes this as an extension point.  There's an additional problem here that this is set for each instance of a `ProtoNode`, so if someone's building a large DAG then we're invoking this new checking logic each time a new block is built. For a builder that's not a `cid.Prefix` type, we're going to be calling `Sum()` for each new `ProtoNode` and then again when the actual CID needs to be created, so a CID requires a double hash. Which is not terrible, but it is additional overhead that wasn't there before.  My opinion on this is something like—there's a place here where you could provide a bad `CidBuilder` that could invoke an error because it's not quite right, but you could just as easily introduce one that has a `func (panicBuilder) Sum([]byte) { panic("suckers"); }`. I think it's on upstream users to make sure that there's some reasonableness check going on before feeding a builder into this API. |

* `nil` slice length is `0` I think returning nil is practically the same as returning an empty slice.
* If this project already depends on `ipfs/go-log` maybe log the error since we can't return it?

no it doesn't depend on go-log directly which is why I didn't do that here, but there's a few indirect uses of it and considering where this library will be used it's probably not going to be a big deal to include it; I've added some log entries for it, feels a bit better.

| should we also introduce a parallel method for Cid() that allows the return of an error  we're dealing with legacy go-ipld-format etc. interfaces here so it's not going to be practical to introduce new APIs to that and work through all the uses of it, especially since we are trying to deprecate these! the `EncodeProtobuf(false)` call should be enough to check for errors and that's included in the docs for these API calls if folks want to check.  I've added log messages and returned `nil` from `RawBytes()`, although it does make me a bit nervous what potential that has for downstream users. Better than a panic hopefully. |

### @rvagg **[rvagg](/rvagg)** commented [Sep 29, 2022](#issue-1390751724)

Attempt to keep ProtoNode always in a state that can be encoded without errors to avoid cases where the panicing methods may be forced to panic on error.

go-codec-dagpb will error when encoding either of the following cases:

* The Hash field in links should always be set, cannot be cid.Undef
* The Tsize field needs to fit into an int64, otherwise it'll overflow to negative which is not allowed

Error on cases where a user may attempt to set links that will eventually error on encode. Then when we do encode, silently handle these cases if they manage to slip through (e.g. if they come in from a decoded block with a bad form).

Sorry, something went wrong.
