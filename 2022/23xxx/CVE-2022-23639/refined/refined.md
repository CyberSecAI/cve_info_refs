    "summary": "The provided content relates to CVE-2022-23639. It describes a race condition vulnerability in the `crossbeam-utils` crate due to incorrect assumptions about memory alignment of 64-bit integers on 32-bit systems which could lead to unaligned memory access and data races. The vulnerability affects versions prior to 0.8.7, with 0.8.7 containing a fix.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption within the `crossbeam-utils` crate that the memory alignment of `{i,u}64` integers is always the same as that of `Atomic{I,U}64`. This assumption is false on some 32-bit architectures, where the alignment of `{i,u}64` may be smaller than that of `Atomic{I,U}64`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect assumption about memory alignment",
        "Potential for unaligned memory access",
        "Potential for data races"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to unaligned memory accesses and data races on affected 32-bit targets. This may cause unpredictable behavior or crashes.",
       "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` on vulnerable 32-bit targets.",
      "required_capabilities": "Exploitation requires the usage of `crossbeam-utils` crate with the vulnerable code present on a 32-bit target that supports `Atomic{I,U}64` with different alignment than `{i,u}64`. The vulnerability is automatically triggered by this usage."
