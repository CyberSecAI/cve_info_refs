# Broken Access Control in queryads endpoint

Low

[PromoFaux](/PromoFaux)
published
GHSA-6qh8-6rrj-7497
Dec 21, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

v2.0 <= v5.17

## Patched versions

>=v5.18

## Description

### Summary

In case of an attack, the threat actor will obtain the ability to perform an unauthorized query for blocked domains on `queryads` endpoint

### Details

Access control, sometimes called authorization, is how a web application grants access to content and functions to some users and not others. These checks are performed after authentication and govern what ‘authorized’ users are allowed to do. Access control sounds like a simple problem but is insidiously difficult to implement correctly. A web application’s access control model is closely tied to the content and functions that the site provides. In addition, the users may fall into a number of groups or roles with different abilities or privileges.

Threat actors can craft special forged requests to obtain users’ data. This vulnerability affects the user's private blacklist of blocked domains.

In the case of application, this vulnerability exists because of a lack of validation in code on a root server path:

`/admin/scripts/pi-hole/phpqueryads.php`

### PoC

1. Open the link in the browser using this template:

   `http://<IP>/admin/scripts/pi-hole/php/queryads.php?domain=kvi1to`

   Where IP is the IP address of the pihole, and `kv1to` is a search query

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108411049/206830085-2c6d71e5-f1dc-4fae-a930-99f80c6dd3f7.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108411049/206830085-2c6d71e5-f1dc-4fae-a930-99f80c6dd3f7.png)

   In the downloaded file:

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108411049/206830104-0265b02c-0313-4f04-b67f-cd5ffc3a266a.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108411049/206830104-0265b02c-0313-4f04-b67f-cd5ffc3a266a.png)

Or with a curl request in the terminal:

`curl 'http://pi.hole/admin/scripts/pi-hole/php/queryads.php?domain=kv1to'`

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108411049/206830141-13365bfe-3eb9-44f9-b4ef-074787e1cc81.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108411049/206830141-13365bfe-3eb9-44f9-b4ef-074787e1cc81.png)

### Impact

There are companies that are selling their on-rolling updated blacklist as a service for the customers.

Threat Actor is able to perform an unauthorized query search in blocked domain lists. This could lead to the disclosure for any victims' personal blacklists.

This is one of the most valuable features of a pihole - data privacy, and this vulnerability could break it up.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23513

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
