Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23513:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control validation in the `queryads` endpoint located at `/admin/scripts/pi-hole/php/queryads.php`. Specifically, there's insufficient validation of the input when querying blocked domains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly restrict access to the `queryads` endpoint, allowing unauthorized users to query blocked domains. This is due to a lack of validation on a root server path.
- **Information Disclosure:** The lack of access control leads to the disclosure of the user's private blacklist of blocked domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform unauthorized queries to view a victim's private blacklist of blocked domains.
- This compromises the data privacy of the user, which is a key feature of Pi-hole.
- Companies that sell updated blacklists as a service could have their lists exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with a `domain` parameter.
- The attacker can use a web browser or tools like `curl` to send the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Pi-hole instance.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Pi-hole versions v2.0 up to v5.17.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version v5.18 and later.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a crafted URL or a `curl` command.

**CVE Information:**
- The CVE ID is CVE-2022-23513.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as Low.

The information extracted provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its root cause, and how it can be exploited.
