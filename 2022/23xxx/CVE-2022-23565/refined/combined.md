# `CHECK`-fail with repeated `AttrDef`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-4v5p-v5h9-6xjx
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can trigger denial of service via assertion failure by altering a `SavedModel` on disk such that `AttrDef`s of some operation are duplicated.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c2b31ff2d3151acb230edc3f5b1832d2c713a9e0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c2b31ff2d3151acb230edc3f5b1832d2c713a9e0).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23565

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Remove a `DCHECK`-fail, log an error instead.

```
`DCHECK` in debug mode results in crashes. TensorFlow has had multiple vulnerabilities due to this.

Outside of debug mode, `DCHECK` is a no-op.

A better alternative is to report an error to the log buffer and continue. This should happen both in debug mode and in prod mode.
