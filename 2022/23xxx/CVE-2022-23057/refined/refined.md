  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in ERPNext allows low privileged users to inject malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The injected scripts can extract the sid token and cookies of the victim, which can lead to full account takeover and privilege escalation. Additionally, the platform becomes unusable for the victim due to the malicious javascript payload.",
  "Attack vectors": "A low-privileged user can inject malicious code into the 'Location', 'Interests', and 'Bio' fields of their profile via the application's user interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs a low-privileged user account on the ERPNext platform. They also require a simple http listener to capture the session data."
