```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by using `strcpy` into a fixed-size buffer in the `xhtml_translate_entity` function within `src/xhtml.c`. This function does not properly handle input strings that are too large, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of `strcpy` without checking the input string length against the buffer size.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious EPUB document.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted EPUB file containing a specially crafted XHTML document with long entities that trigger the overflow when processed by `epub2txt2`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted EPUB file as an input to the `epub2txt2` utility. This could involve distributing malicious EPUB files via the internet."
