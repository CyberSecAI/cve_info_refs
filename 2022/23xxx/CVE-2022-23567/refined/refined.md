Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23567:

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in the `SparseDenseCwise*` operations within TensorFlow. Specifically, it stems from a lack of proper validation of input tensor shapes, which can lead to integer overflows. This overflow results in large memory allocations or `CHECK`-fails, leading to denial of service.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation of tensor shapes within the `SparseDenseCwise*` operations.
- Direct construction of `TensorShape` objects using user-provided dimensions without proper overflow checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflows when calculating tensor dimensions due to large user-supplied shape inputs.
- Missing validation for shapes of input tensors.
- Construction of potentially oversized `TensorShape` objects based on user inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions caused by large memory allocations.
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to `CHECK`-fails (assertion failures) when building new, very large `TensorShape` objects, causing program termination.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted input tensors with extremely large dimensions provided to `SparseDenseCwise*` operations via the TensorFlow API.
- Specifically, crafting inputs to `sp_shape` argument such that it results in large allocations or crashes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide inputs to TensorFlow operations, specifically the `SparseDenseCwise*` operations.
- No specific privileges are required; the vulnerability is exploitable through the standard TensorFlow API.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is similar to TFSA-2021-198 (CVE-2021-41197), which also involved integer overflows due to large tensor shapes.
- The fix involves adding input validation and replacing direct `TensorShape` construction with a call to `BuildTensorShape` which includes overflow checks.
- The vulnerable code is located in `tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_dense_binary_op_shared.cc`.
- Affected operations include `SparseDenseCwiseMul`, `SparseDenseCwiseDiv`, and `SparseDenseCwiseAdd`, or potentially all `Sparse*Cwise*` ops.
- This vulnerability was reported by Faysal Hossain Shezan from University of Virginia.
