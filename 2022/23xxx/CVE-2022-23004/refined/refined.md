The provided content directly addresses **CVE-2022-23004**.

**Root Cause:**
The Sweet B cryptographic library, when computing a shared secret or point multiplication on the NIST P-256 curve using a public key with an X coordinate of zero, returns an error and writes an invalid, unreduced value to the output buffer before signaling the error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The library writes an invalid, unreduced value to the output buffer when an error condition occurs.
- Inconsistent error handling: A value is written to the output buffer even when an error will be returned.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause an error scenario, potentially leading to denial of service in applications utilizing the library.
- Writing an invalid value to the output buffer before an error may affect applications that don't properly check for error returns, potentially corrupting the data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can manipulate inputs, specifically a public key with an X coordinate of zero, to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling point multiplication or shared secret computation routines of the Sweet B library, passing a maliciously crafted public key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a public key with an X coordinate of zero as input to the vulnerable library routines (point multiplication or shared secret calculation) to trigger this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to call functions of the library
