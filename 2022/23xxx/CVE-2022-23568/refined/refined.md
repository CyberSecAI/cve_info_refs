{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` operation in TensorFlow is vulnerable to an integer overflow when constructing a `TensorShape` object from user-provided dimensions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow",
    "Lack of input validation for tensor shapes",
    "Direct construction of `TensorShape` with user-provided dimensions"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering a `CHECK`-fail (assertion failure) due to the integer overflow, crashing the TensorFlow process.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing maliciously crafted input tensors with very large dimensions to the `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` operation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input tensors passed to the `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` operation."
