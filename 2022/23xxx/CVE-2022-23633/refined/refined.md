      "root_cause": "Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response is not notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request.",

        "Improper handling of response bodies",
        "Failure to reset thread local state"

        "A bug in a webserver",
        "A bug in a Rack middleware"
