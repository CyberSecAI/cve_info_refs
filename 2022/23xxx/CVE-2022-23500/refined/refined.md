- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The page error handler in TYPO3 recursively calls itself when trying to retrieve content for an error message from another page after requesting an invalid or non-existent resource, leading to a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Recursive call within the page error handler leading to excessive resource consumption. CWE-405 (Resource not Released) and CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) are listed as weaknesses.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS) by exhausting web server resources due to recursive calls, rendering the application unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack by requesting invalid or non-existent resources via HTTP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application.
