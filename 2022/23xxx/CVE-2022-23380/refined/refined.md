The provided content relates to CVE-2022-23380.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL blind injection in the "Admin Edit" functionality of the taocms application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `admin.php` file when handling the `edit` action.
- The `id` parameter in the `admin.php` is vulnerable and can be manipulated to inject SQL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database using blind SQL injection techniques.
- An attacker can potentially modify database contents.
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to data and potentially compromise the entire application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request by crafting malicious SQL payloads within the `id` parameter of `admin/admin.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`
- The specific endpoint used is `/admin/admin.php?action=admin&id=[SQL Injection Payload]&ctrl=edit`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
- The attacker needs to have some level of familiarity with SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.
