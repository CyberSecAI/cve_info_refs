{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The TFG dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. These assumptions can be invalidated by modifying the `SavedModel` format on disk.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of the `GraphDef` during conversion to MLIR, leading to incorrect assumptions about the data structure."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap out-of-bounds read/write are possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By modifying the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate the assumptions made by the TFG dialect during the conversion of `GraphDef` to MLIR-based IR."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the `SavedModel` on disk prior to the conversion process, which allows them to control the input data."
