 speculative security issues
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The content describes that "AMD have discovered that under some circumstances, the previous reported information about Branch Type Confusion (XSA-407 / CVE-2022-23825) was inaccurate. Specifically, it was previously reported that the small speculation window was not long enough to contain two dependent loads. It has turned out not to be true, and in some circumstances, the speculation window is long enough to contain two dependent loads."
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Branch Type Confusion vulnerability. Speculative execution can lead to incorrect branch predictions.
-   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker might be able to infer the contents of memory belonging to other guests. An attacker can infer the content of memory that belongs to Xen itself in some configurations where the RAS/RSB is not flushed by default.
-   **Attack vectors**: An attacker-controlled value can survive across a deliberate attempt to purge it from the RAS. A malicious guest can potentially exploit this, but due to existing mitigations, it cannot infer the content of Xen's memory in default configurations.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious guest on the system is required. The attacker needs the ability to control values that will be speculatively used.

[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: kernel-5.18.11-100.fc35
```
```
[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: kernel-5.18.11-200.fc36
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: These updates mention "x86/cpu/amd: Enumerate BTC_NO" and "x86/bugs: Add AMD retbleed= boot parameter" indicating fixes for speculative execution issues related to AMD CPUs, including Branch Type Confusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Branch Type Confusion vulnerability. These are related to the "Retbleed" vulnerability as well, which is a speculative execution attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The updates aim to mitigate information disclosure and arbitrary speculative code execution via the mentioned vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: The updates address speculative execution vulnerabilities affecting AMD CPUs, which can be exploited by crafting specific instruction sequences.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to execute code that can manipulate the branch predictor and leak data through speculative execution.

```
[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: xen-4.15.3-4.fc35
```
```
[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: xen-4.16.1-6.fc36
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The update descriptions indicate that the updates address "Retbleed - arbitrary speculative code execution with return instructions [XSA-407, CVE-2022-23816, CVE-2022-23825, CVE-2022-29900]". This includes mitigations for branch type confusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Branch Type Confusion vulnerability. These updates are specifically focused on speculative execution vulnerabilities in Xen.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The updates aim to mitigate arbitrary speculative code execution and information disclosure vulnerabilities, particularly in the context of virtualized environments.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can leverage speculative execution vulnerabilities through crafted code within the guest OS which can cause data leakage or arbitrary code execution on the host.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious guest with the ability to execute code on the virtualized environment.

[SECURITY] [DSA 5184-1] xen security update
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: This update addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Xen, including "CVE-2022-23825". This is related to speculative execution and branch type confusion on AMD processors
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Branch Type Confusion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Privilege escalation, information disclosure from other guests
-   **Attack vectors**:  The attacker can potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain access to data from other VMs or the hypervisor itself.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker would need to be in a position to influence the branch predictor, which can often be achieved from a guest VM.

```
AMD CPU Branch Type Confusion
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: "Aliases in the branch predictor may cause some AMD processors to predict the wrong branch type potentially leading to information disclosure."
-   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Branch Type Confusion vulnerability, incorrect speculative branch predictions.
-   **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure, arbitrary speculative code execution.
-  **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the branch predictor by manipulating the branch types.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the CPU to leverage this vulnerability.

Xen: Multiple Vulnerabilities â€” GLSA 202402-07
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple vulnerabilities in Xen, including "CVE-2022-23825"
-   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Branch Type Confusion vulnerability.
-   **Impact of exploitation**: The GLSA mentions that the worst case scenario is arbitrary code execution and is likely to be privilege escalation through speculative execution.
-   **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation is possible.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but potentially remote and requiring a malicious guest VM.
