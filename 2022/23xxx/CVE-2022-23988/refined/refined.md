The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WS Form and WS Form Pro WordPress plugins.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugins fail to sanitize and escape form data submitted by users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User-supplied input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of privileged users (e.g., administrators) when they view the related submission, potentially leading to:
    - Account compromise of administrative users.
    - Website defacement.
    - Data theft.
    - Further malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can submit a form containing a malicious XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the contact form and submit data. No authentication is required.
