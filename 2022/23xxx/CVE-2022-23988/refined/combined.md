## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WS Form < 1.8.176 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugins do not sanitise and escape submitted form data, allowing unauthenticated attacker to submit XSS payloads which will get executed when a privileged user will view the related submission

### Proof of Concept

- Created a basic contact form and publish it
- As an unauthenticated user, go the page/post where the form is embed and put the following payload in the "Your Inquiry" or in "Description" fields: "><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
- The XSS will be triggered when an admin will view the related submission (eg: wp-admin/admin.php?orderby&order&page=ws-form-submit&id=1&paged=1#1)
