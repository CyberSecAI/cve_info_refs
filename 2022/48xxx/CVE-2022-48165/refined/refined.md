Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a broken access control issue in the WAVLINK Aerial G - AC1200 High Power Dual Band Wireless Router (WL-WN530H4). Specifically, the `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` script does not properly check user authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication or authorization checks when accessing the `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` script. This allows unauthenticated users to bypass access restrictions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` script reveals sensitive information such as configurations and admin credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the router's configuration data and log files.
*   **Credential Exposure:** The most significant impact is the exposure of admin credentials, enabling attackers to fully control the device.
*   **Device Compromise:** With admin access, attackers can modify device settings, intercept network traffic, or use the device as a bot in a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This would typically be over the network the device is connected to (Local Area Network/LAN or Wide Area Network/WAN if the router's management interface is exposed).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** An attacker must have network connectivity to the affected WAVLINK router to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a simple HTTP request.
*  **No Authentication Needed:** No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to firmware version `M30H4.V5030.210121` of the WAVLINK WL-WN530H4 router.
*   The exploit involves requesting the `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` script without prior authentication.
*   The provided images show the affected device details, the vulnerable request, and the admin dashboard.
