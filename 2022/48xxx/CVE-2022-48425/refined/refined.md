  "cve": "CVE-2022-48425",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "affected_products": [
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A malformed $MFT (Master File Table) record with the RECORD_FLAG_DIR flag set and containing an ATTR_ROOT attribute causes the kernel to incorrectly treat it as a directory. This leads to an attempt to free resources that were never allocated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of MFT record flags",
       "Use of uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "An invalid kfree operation, leading to a kernel crash (Denial of Service), and potentially sensitive information disclosure.",
     "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted NTFS image containing a malformed $MFT record that will trigger the vulnerability during the mount operation",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to mount a specially crafted NTFS image on a system running the vulnerable kernel."
  },
    "patch": {
        "description": "The patch validates that the MFT_REC_MFT (Master File Table Record) is not treated as a directory during log replay by checking the RECORD_FLAG_DIR flag. If both conditions are true, the process is terminated to avoid the use of uninitialized memory.",
         "code_changes": "The following code was added to `fs/ntfs3/inode.c`:\n```c\n    is_dir = rec->flags & RECORD_FLAG_DIR;\n    /* MFT_REC_MFT is not a dir */\n    if (is_dir && ino == MFT_REC_MFT) {\n        err = -EINVAL;\n        goto out;\n    }\n```"

 "affected_versions": "Linux Kernel versions through 6.2.7",
  "cvss_score": "7.8 (HIGH)",
