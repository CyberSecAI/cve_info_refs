Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified XSS vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the XSS vulnerabilities lies in the improper handling of user-supplied data within the Mapos application. Specifically, the application retrieves user input (like phone numbers or search queries) and directly inserts them into HTML views without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application, by default, does not sanitize user input before storing it in the database or displaying it on web pages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Direct HTML Injection:** The application directly inserts data from the database or user input into HTML code without encoding, enabling XSS attacks.
*   **Configuration Issue:** The CodeIgniter framework used by Mapos has a global XSS filtering setting (`$config['global_xss_filtering']`) that is set to `FALSE` by default after running `composer install --no-dev`. This means that user inputs are not being sanitized unless explicitly done so within the code.
*   **Vulnerable code examples:**
    *   The 'telefone' field is saved in the database without sanitization and later rendered in HTML without encoding.
    *   The 'pesquisa' input field in `arquivos.php` takes the user's GET parameter directly into the HTML value without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application through vulnerable fields.
*   **Data theft:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
*   **Account Hijacking:**  By injecting malicious scripts, attackers could manipulate the web page to redirect users to phishing sites or steal their login credentials.
*   **Malicious actions:** Attackers could perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could change the website content displayed to users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Input Fields:** Exploiting user input fields such as phone number fields or search fields.
*   **GET parameters:** Exploiting GET parameters that are displayed on the website.
*   **Database:** An attacker can inject the payload through input fields, and because there is no sanitation before saving data to the database, the payload can be triggered when data is rendered on the views.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.**
*   **Ability to interact with the application's forms and input fields.**
*   No special privileges are required to execute the attack. A normal user can submit a malicious payload to the vulnerable fields.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The identified issues are related to both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The provided pull request ([#2015](https://github.com/RamonSilva20/mapos/pull/2015)) aims to mitigate the vulnerability by sanitizing all POST and GET inputs.
*   The discussion highlights that CodeIgniter recommends output sanitization rather than input sanitization, meaning that the fix should be applied to the views rather than the controller input processing.

In summary, the content demonstrates multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the Mapos application due to a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding. The attacker needs to be able to input data into the application using standard forms. The impact is significant, potentially leading to data theft, account hijacking, and website defacement.
