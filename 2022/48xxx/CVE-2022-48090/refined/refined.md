{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses string concatenation to build SQL queries in multiple files, instead of using parameterized queries, which leads to SQL injection vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or modifying the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the input fields of the 'update profile' functionality, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the queries.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the application."
