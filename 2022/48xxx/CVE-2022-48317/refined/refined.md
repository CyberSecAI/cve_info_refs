- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The REST API only validated the cookie signature and not the session's expiration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session cookies remained valid on the REST API after expiration if the signature was valid. This allowed actions not requiring access to the user session to be performed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who steals a session cookie could use it on the REST API, even after the session has expired. This would allow them to perform actions that do not require access to the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** Stealing a valid session cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to steal a session cookie.
