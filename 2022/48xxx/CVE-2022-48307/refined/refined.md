The content is related to CVE-2022-48307.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper validation of hostnames in TLS certificates within several Palantir services, including magritte-ftp. This was due to a misuse of the `javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory` API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper hostname verification during TLS certificate validation. This allows for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful MITM attack allows an attacker to intercept, read, and modify network communications to and from the affected services. In the specific case of magritte-ftp, this could lead to the exposure or modification of authentication tokens and raw data entering a Palantir Foundry stack.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious attacker in a privileged network position is required to perform a MITM attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be in a privileged network position to intercept network traffic between the affected service and the target host.
