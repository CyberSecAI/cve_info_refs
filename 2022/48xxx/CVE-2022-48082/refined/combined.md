## Description

The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on a database.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. A remote non-authenticated attacker can send a specially crafted request to the affected application and execute arbitrary SQL commands within the application database.
