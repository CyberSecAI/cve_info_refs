- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can read, delete, modify data in the database and gain complete control over the affected application.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted request to the affected application via the `text` parameter in a GET request to the `/Services/Misc.asmx/SearchTag` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application. No authentication is needed.
