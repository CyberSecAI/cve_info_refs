NETGEAR is aware of a pre-authentication stack overflow security vulnerability on some routers and Nighthawk WiFi Mesh Systems. This vulnerability requires an attacker to have your WiFi password or an Ethernet connection to your router to be exploited.

**To download the latest firmware for your NETGEAR product:**

2. Start typing your model number in the search box, then select your model from the drop-down menu as soon as it appears.

   If you do not see a drop-down menu, make sure that you entered your model number correctly, or select a product category to browse for your product model.
3. Click **Downloads**.
4. Under **Current Versions**, select the first download whose title begins with **Firmware Version**.
5. Click **Release Notes**.

### Best Practices for Updating Firmware

We recommend that you keep your NETGEAR devices up to date with the latest firmware. Firmware updates contain security fixes, bug fixes, and new features for your NETGEAR products.

If your product is supported by one of our apps, using the app is the easiest way to update your firmware:

* Orbi products: NETGEAR Orbi app
* NETGEAR WiFi routers: NETGEAR Nighthawk app
* Some NETGEAR Business products: NETGEAR Insight app (firmware updates through the app are available only for Insight subscribers)

If your product is not supported by one of our apps, you can always update your firmware manually by following the instructions in your product's user manual, firmware release notes, or product support page. For more information, see [Where can I find information about my NETGEAR product?](https://kb.netgear.com/000060613/).

### Contact

We appreciate and value having security concerns brought to our attention. NETGEAR constantly monitors for both known and unknown threats. Being pro-active rather than re-active to emerging security issues is fundamental for product support at NETGEAR.

It is NETGEAR's mission to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet. To achieve this mission, we strive to earn and maintain the trust of those that use NETGEAR products for their connectivity.

# NETGEAR Product Security

#####

NETGEAR’s mission is to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet. To achieve this mission, we strive to earn and maintain the trust of our customers by delivering products that are secure and that will protect the privacy and security of our customers’ data. [Learn more](/security/)

We appreciate having security concerns brought to our attention and are constantly monitoring our products to get in front of the latest threats. Being pro-active rather than re-active to emerging security issues is a fundamental belief at NETGEAR. NETGEAR strives to keep up-to-date on the latest security developments by working with both security researchers and companies. We appreciate the community's efforts in creating a more secure world.

To protect users, NETGEAR does not publicly announce security vulnerabilities until fixes are publicly available, nor are the exact details of such vulnerabilities released. Once fixes are available, NETGEAR will announce the vulnerabilities on this page.

##### NETGEAR End of Service

Since continual innovation is the core of NETGEAR’s business, NETGEAR will end service to products three years after their last manufacturing date (or longer where required by law). Once a product has entered End of Service, NETGEAR will no longer provide any new support/maintenance firmware releases, including security updates.

* 2022-07-22 Netgear contacted
* 2022-11-01 Fix integrated

## Introduction

Pre-auth remote code execution vulnerability found in the Netgear Nighthawk r7000p on the WAN interface.

Nighthawk R7000P is a popular dual-bank WiFi router advertised with gaming-focused features, smart parental controls, and internal hardware that is sufficiently powerful to accommodate the needs of home power users.

The vulnerability resides in the **/tmp/media/nand/router-analytics/aws\_json** binary, running on the Netgear router.

Due to increasing demand, we do vulnerability research on connected objects (router, camera, printer, etc.).
One of the missions entrusted to us by our client was to find vulnerabilities on a selection of embedded devices, including the aforementioned Netgear Nightawk router.
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered and will be published on the blog.

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability can be remotely exploited by an attacker on the WAN side of the router, without authentication.
The **aws\_json** daemon fetches json data from a webserver and a buffer overflow can be triggered
when parsing this content.

By placing a malicious json content in a webserver and redirecting the router to download it (either by DNS redirection or TCP redirection), an
attacker can execute arbitrary code. As aws\_json runs under the root user, the attacker gains
full privileges on the router.

aws\_json is a program that connects to the domain devicelocation.ngxcld.com when the
router starts. It sends an HTTP GET request at the address
**https://devicelocation.ngxcld.com/device-location/resolve** to fetch information about the
device location.

![](aws_json.png)

The server reponse is a json content that specifies information like city, country, etc.

We noticed that the curl request is sent using the HTTPS protocol. However, the **-k** option given to curl explicitly prevents certificate signature and CommonName veritication. In other words, it means that anybody can impersonate the remote server.
The json content will be written to file **/tmp/xCloud\_MAXmind** which is then parsed by aws\_json.

Here is the function body that parses the file:

However, the strcpy() function does not check the size of each field. Itâs possible to write a large enough content leading to a stack buffer overflow.

## Exploitation

### Overwriting function pointer

We noted the binary is not ASLR compiled and the executable addresses are in the range 0x00008000 and 0x00027000. All other mapped modules run with randomized base addresses.

```

00008000-00027000 r-xp 00000000 1f:11 315        /tmp/media/nand/router-analytics/aws_json

```

So, we needed to overwrite the PC register with an address in the binary, but also needed to put a null char at the end. This was made possible thanks to the strcpy() function.

### Finding gadget

By exploring all gadgets pointing to the system() function, we can see at offset 0x00014E20:

SP points to contents that are not immediately controllable because it is located just after the return address. It is not possible to write there because strcpy() stops at the null byte.
However, the vulnerability can be triggered twice, thanks to the multiple strcpy() calls. We can trigger in this order:- The first stack buffer overflow writes the payload to execute (here it is **utelnetd -l /bin/sh;**)
- The second stack buffer overflow controls the PC value, redirecting execution flow

So, with these two overflows, we can call system() and execute our payload written on the stack.

To perform this attack, We configured a Raspberry Pi 4 as follows:- Configuration in router mode to intercept and modify requests (dnsmaq, dhcp server).
- Edit dnsmasq.conf to hijack the DNS devicelocation.ngxcld.com: **address=/devicelocation.ngxcld.com/192.168.2.1**
- Launch a custom HTTPS server in Python on 192.168.2.1 which will send the payload to aws\_json when the GET request is handled.

To summarize, we need to:- Plug the Netgear router WAN port into the ethernet port of the Raspberry Pi
- Launch the HTTPS server.py
- Boot the Netgear router and wait for a remote shell.

## Recommendations

In general, it is important to force verification of HTTPS certificates by removing any -k (or --insecure) option from curl.
Otherwise, it will be possible to intercept and modify on the fly via MiTM the packets that pass through, which can lead to the compromise of the router.

Also, it is necessary to replace strcpy() with safer functions -- such as strncpy() -- to control the size of the processed data in order to avoid memory safety problems. Use appropriate compiler options (like -Wformat-overflow=2, -Wformat-security, -Wfortify-source, -Wformat=2, ...) to detect these issues preemptively.

## Conclusion

This vulnerability research was requested by one of our customers who wanted to know if it was possible to compromise the company's routers.

The vulnerability we found made it possible to obtain a shell on the router which could subsequently lead to access to third-party subnets.
Netgear is a major player in network devices for home and small/medium companies which makes their product a valuable target for hacker.

Note that other Netgear products were affected by the same vulnerability.
