The provided content describes a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `formSetStaticRoute` function of Tenda W20E router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` to copy user-controlled input parameters (`staticRouteNet`, `staticRouteMask`, `staticRouteGateway`, and `staticRouteWAN`) into a fixed-size stack buffer `sMibValue` without any size checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into a buffer on the stack. The size of the buffer (`sMibValue`) is 256 bytes, but the input from the parameters is not validated, allowing an attacker to provide input that exceeds this buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Overwriting the stack buffer can lead to a crash of the affected service or the entire device.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): A carefully crafted overflow can overwrite the return address on the stack, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered when the device processes a POST request to `/goform/setStaticRoute/` containing malicious values in the `staticRouteNet`, `staticRouteMask`, `staticRouteGateway`, and `staticRouteWAN` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.
- Authentication: The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows that authentication is required before sending the malicious request.
