{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the `ntfs_set_ea` function in the Linux kernel's ntfs3 file system driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have the ability to mount and interact with an affected ntfs3 filesystem."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have local access to a system with a vulnerable Linux kernel and the ability to mount an ntfs3 file system. The attacker would then need to trigger a call to `ntfs_set_ea` with crafted input which leads to the out-of-bounds read.",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs within the ntfs3 file system driver when handling extended attributes (EAs). Specifically, the `ntfs_set_ea` function performs insufficient bounds checking while processing the attributes, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can be triggered during operations that modify file attributes such as changing ownership (chown), potentially leading to information disclosure or a denial of service due to kernel crashes (KASAN reports)."

  "affected_products": [
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C",
    "NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS)"
  ],
  "remediation": "The vulnerability is fixed by commit `0e8235d28f3a` which adds additional checks for correctness while reading from the disk. NetApp provides patches for the affected products through their support website. However, some NetApp products are listed as EOA (End of Availability) and therefore do not plan to fix the issue."
