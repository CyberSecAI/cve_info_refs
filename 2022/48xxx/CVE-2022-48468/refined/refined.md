{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An unsigned integer overflow can occur in the `parse_required_member` function of the protobuf-c library when parsing protobuf messages. Specifically, when calculating the remaining length of the message after processing a prefix, the code directly subtracts the prefix length from the total length using unsigned integers, which can result in an overflow if the prefix length is larger than the total length.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsigned integer overflow in length calculation during protobuf message parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact is not explicitly stated but, based on the context of an integer overflow during length calculation for parsing, this could lead to an out-of-bounds read/write or other memory corruption issues when attempting to unpack or process the data using the incorrect length. This could potentially cause crashes, denial of service, or possibly arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption is severe enough. More specifically, it can cause `protobuf_c_message_unpack` to read past the end of the buffer.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted protobuf message is parsed. An attacker could send a malformed message with a manipulated prefix length to trigger the overflow and cause the described consequences during the parsing stage.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send or provide specially crafted protobuf messages to an application using the vulnerable protobuf-c library. No special network position is required beyond being able to deliver the malformed message to the target."
