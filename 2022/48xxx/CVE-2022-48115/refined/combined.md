## Installation

### NPM

`npm install jspreadsheet-ce`

### CDN

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jspreadsheet-ce/dist/index.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jspreadsheet-ce/dist/jspreadsheet.min.css" type="text/css" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsuites/dist/jsuites.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsuites/dist/jsuites.min.css" type="text/css" />
```

### Basic Demo

A basic example to integrate the Jspreadsheet in your website to create your first data grid with spreadsheet controls. <https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/qBRzXKK>

#### Usage

Add jexcel/jspreadsheet and Jsuites to your html file

```
<script src="https://bossanova.uk/jspreadsheet/v5/jspreadsheet.js"></script>
<script src="https://jsuites.net/v5/jsuites.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bossanova.uk/jspreadsheet/v5/jspreadsheet.css" type="text/css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://jsuites.net/v5/jsuites.css" type="text/css" />
```

You should initialize your data grid on a div container, such as:

```
<div id="spreadsheet"></div>
```

To initialize a Jspreadsheet CE table you should run JavaScript, such as:

```
jspreadsheet(document.getElementById('spreadsheet'), {
    worksheets: [{
        data: [
            ['Jazz', 'Honda', '2019-02-12', '', true, '$ 2.000,00', '#777700'],
            ['Civic', 'Honda', '2018-07-11', '', true, '$ 4.000,01', '#007777'],
        ],
        columns: [
            { type: 'text', title:'Car', width:120 },
            { type: 'dropdown', title:'Make', width:200, source:[ "Alfa Romeo", "Audi", "Bmw", "Honda" ] },
            { type: 'calendar', title:'Available', width:200 },
            { type: 'image', title:'Photo', width:120 },
            { type: 'checkbox', title:'Stock', width:80 },
            { type: 'numeric', title:'Price', width:100, mask:'$ #.##,00', decimal:',' },
            { type: 'color', width:100, render:'square', }
        ]
    }]
});
```

Serve your html file and then you will get the rendered table in your browser

| Your example is not very good since you are altering the source code and not injecting something in the source code. But, from your example we have found another point that can improve and we are going to update soon. Another point is, we have already launched jSuites Version 5 which improves some security aspects of the library. |
