Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3557-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                           Chris Lamb
September 07, 2023                            <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : memcached
Version        : 1.5.6-1.1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-48571

It was discovered that there was a potential Denial of Service (DoS)
vulnerability in memcached, a high-performance in-memory object
caching system.

A crash could have occured when handling "multi-packet" uploads in
UDP mode. Deployments of memcached that only use TCP are likely
unaffected by this issue.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.5.6-1.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.

For the detailed security status of memcached please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/memcached>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

udp: crash fix when receiving multi-packet uploads

```
multi-packet sets aren't supported in UDP. It was trying to write an
error message in response, but no mc_resp object was initialized at the
time, leading to a null reference crash.

Instead drop the packet quietly since that's a pretty fatal bug anyway
and keeps the parser simplified.

For credits see accompanying release notes.
