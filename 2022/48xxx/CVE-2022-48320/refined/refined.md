- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `add-visual` endpoint of Checkmk.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to add elements to visuals (e.g., dashboards, reports) without proper authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify visuals by adding arbitrary elements to dashboards and reports. This could lead to defacement, information disclosure or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a CSRF attack, which typically involves tricking a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to click a crafted link or visit a malicious website. The user needs to be logged into Checkmk. No other special capabilities or privileges are required, other than the ability to trick a user into performing an action while authenticated with the Checkmk system.
