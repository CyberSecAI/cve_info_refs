Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in the `drm_save_keys()` function within the Widevine Trusted Application.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** The calculation of `total_len` (which is used to validate the buffer size before copying data) is performed using a signed integer. When adding the length of a prefix string and a user-controlled length (`feature_name_len`), it can overflow, resulting in a negative value. This bypasses a size check.
*   **Unchecked Buffer Copy:** Following the bypassed check, the code uses `memcpy` to copy data into a buffer using the user-controlled length, without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow. Specifically, the `feature_name` buffer which can be specified by a client via the Request Buffer is copied to memory that exceeds the bounds of the allocated buffer due to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the Secure World context by exploiting the buffer overflow.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain control of the Trusted Application.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The attacker could read or modify sensitive information within the secure environment.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can cause the Trusted Application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Normal World to Secure World Communication:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted command from the Normal World (the Android OS) to the Widevine Trusted Application running in the Secure World (Qualcomm's QSEE).
*   **Maliciously Crafted Request:** The attacker crafts a command request with a specific `feature_name_len` value (causing the integer overflow) and content for the `feature_name` buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **High Privileges in Normal World:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges in the Normal World to be able to send commands to the Secure World.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `drm_save_keys` function, specifically at address 0x69b0
*   The vulnerable code copies data using `memcpy` into a heap buffer. The size of the copy is controlled by the client via the `feature_name_len` parameter which is not properly checked due to an integer overflow.
*   The `feature_name_len` parameter can be set to a range of values that causes an overflow, specifically between `0xfffffff2` (-14) and `0xffffffff` (-1), which are then used as the size in `memcpy`.
*   The target device mentioned is a Google Nexus 6, and affected versions of Android are listed.
*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to trigger the crash. The integer overflow is triggered by setting the `feature_name_len` to `0xffffffff`, bypassing the size check and causing a crash when `memcpy` copies out of the bounds of the heap buffer.
