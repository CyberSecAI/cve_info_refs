## **Best Practices for Updating Firmware**

We recommend that you keep your NETGEAR devices up to date with the latest firmware. Firmware updates contain security fixes, bug fixes, and new features for your NETGEAR products.

If your product is supported by one of our apps, using the app is the easiest way to update your firmware:

* Orbi products: NETGEAR Orbi app

* Some NETGEAR Business products: NETGEAR Insight app (firmware updates through the app are available only for Insight subscribers)

If your product is not supported by one of our apps, you can always update your firmware manually by following the instructions in your product’s user manual, firmware release notes, or product support page. For more information, see [Where can I find information about my NETGEAR product?](https://kb.netgear.com/000060613/Where-can-I-find-information-about-my-NETGEAR-product).

We appreciate and value having security concerns brought to our attention. NETGEAR constantly monitors for both known and unknown threats. Being pro-active rather than re-active to emerging security issues is fundamental for product support at NETGEAR.

It is NETGEAR's mission to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet. To achieve this mission, we strive to earn and maintain the trust of those that use NETGEAR products for their connectivity.

Netgear has fixed a high-severity vulnerability affecting multiple WiFi router models and advised customers to update their devices to the latest available firmware as soon as possible.

The flaw impacts multiple [Wireless AC Nighthawk](https://www.netgear.com/home/wifi/routers/r8000p/), [Wireless AX Nighthawk (WiFi 6)](https://www.netgear.com/home/wifi/routers/rax40/), and [Wireless AC](https://www.netgear.com/home/wifi/routers/r6400/) router models.

Although Netgear did not disclose any information about the component affected by this bug or its impact, it did say that it is a pre-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability.

The impact of a successful [buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html) [overflow](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html) exploitation can range from crashes following denial of service to arbitrary code execution, if code execution is achieved during the attack.

Attackers can exploit this flaw in low-complexity attacks without requiring permissions or user interaction.

In a security advisory published on Wednesday, Netgear said it "strongly recommends that you download the latest firmware as soon as possible."

The list of vulnerable routers and the patched firmware versions can be found in the table below.

| **Vulnerable Netgear router** | **Patched firmware version** |
| --- | --- |
| RAX40 | Firmware version 1.0.2.60 |
| RAX35 | Firmware version 1.0.2.60 |
| R6400v2 | Firmware version 1.0.4.122 |
| R6700v3 | Firmware version 1.0.4.122 |
| R6900P | Firmware version 1.3.3.152 |
| R7000P | Firmware version 1.3.3.152 |
| R7000P | Firmware version 1.0.11.136 |
| R7960P | Firmware version 1.4.4.94 |
| R8000P | Firmware version 1.4.4.94 |

## How to update your router's firmware

To download and install the latest firmware for your Netgear router, you have to go through the following steps:

1. Visit [NETGEAR Support](https://www.netgear.com/support/).
2. Start typing your model number in the search box, then select your model from the drop-down menu as soon as it appears.
3. If you do not see a drop-down menu, ensure you entered your model number correctly or select a product category to browse for your product model.
4. Click **Downloads**.
5. Under **Current Versions**, select the first download whose title begins with **Firmware Version**.
6. Click **Release Notes**.
7. Follow the instructions in the firmware release notes to download and install the new firmware.

"The pre-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability remains if you do not complete all recommended steps," [Netgear also warned](http://kb.netgear.com/000065495/Security-Advisory-for-Pre-Authentication-Buffer-Overflow-on-Some-Routers-PSV-2019-0208).

"NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by following the recommendations in this notification."

A Netgear spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today for more information.

On Wednesday, Netgear [urged customers](https://kb.netgear.com/000065497/Security-Advisory-for-Denial-of-Service-on-Some-Routers-PSV-2019-0104) to patch a second vulnerability that can be exploited to trigger a denial of service state in attacks targeting Wireless AC Nighthawk and Wireless AX Nighthawk (WiFi 6) routers.

Earlier this year, Netgear also [fixed a bad Orbi firmware update](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/netgear-fixes-bad-orbi-firmware-update-that-locked-admin-console/) that prevented customers from accessing their devices' admin consoles.

  Thank you for information.

  Caught an error b/c our grandmother has a router model very close to ours, and the information in the table shown has duplicated versions, and one is slightly different than what's shown.

  These were confirmed before my post by way of the Netgear support site, from which I've just DL'd FW and updated locally before I head over to Granny's to update her router.

  Interestingly and surprisingly, perhaps only to me, is that going through the router's advanced/administration/firmware version check indicated (incorrectly) that "no new firmware version is available."

  Should be:

  R7000 (no P) / Firmware version 1.0.11.136\_10.2.120

  R7000P / Firmware version 1.3.3.154\_10.1.86

  Cheers!
