    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DNS server did not properly handle self-referencing CNAME records, leading to an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of CNAME records, specifically self-referencing CNAMEs which lead to an infinite loop.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption when the server is stuck in an infinite loop processing the self-referencing CNAME record.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a DNS query that triggers the resolution of a self-referencing CNAME record.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to the vulnerable server."
