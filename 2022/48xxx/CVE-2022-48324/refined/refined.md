Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `mapos` application. Specifically, user-provided data such as phone numbers and search queries are not being sanitized before being displayed in the application's views. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts. The CodeIgniter framework's global XSS filtering is disabled by default which exacerbates the issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks in multiple locations. User-supplied data is directly inserted into HTML without sanitization. This includes:
    *   The `telefone` field, which is saved in the database and later displayed in a view.
    *   The search query parameter (`pesquisa`) in the `arquivos.php` view.
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The application relies on the CodeIgniter framework for sanitization, but the default configuration disables global XSS filtering. The application doesn't sanitize user inputs explicitly before using them in database queries or displaying them on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields.
*   **Data Theft:** The injected script can perform actions like stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can alter the content displayed on the website to trick or mislead users.
*   **Redirection:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Manipulating POST data:** By submitting a POST request with malicious JavaScript in the `telefone` field when creating or updating a client.
*   **Manipulating GET parameters:** By adding a malicious script in the `pesquisa` parameter of the URL.
*   **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability allows for stored XSS, where the injected payload persists in the database and affects all users who view the data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the application, usually by submitting forms or manipulating URL parameters.
*   The attacker does not require privileged access to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability report highlights that the CodeIgniter framework's global XSS filtering is disabled by default (`$config['global_xss_filtering'] = FALSE;`).
*   The report also mentions that sanitization should be applied at the output and not at the input, which is the recommended way to prevent XSS. However, the pull request suggests enabling input sanitization.
*   A pull request was made to add `TRUE` as a parameter to all input functions, which would enable XSS sanitization, however, it was marked as stale and closed before merging.

In summary, the `mapos` application is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to a lack of input sanitization. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts via various input fields that are not sanitized before being displayed to users.
