| Github issue tracker is used for bug only. For general questions and requests, please join the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jorani)  Don't hesitate to provide screenshots. What is the version of Jorani? v1.0 Expected behavior Acronym is just a normal form parameter, but if I modify the length of that column in database, I can input a longer XSS payload [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78632303/209642883-637c691f-7f6c-4bfb-a3cd-e32b56ea2b24.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78632303/209642534-6a958e28-550a-41b0-9ac6-06ed206a80cb.png) Actual behavior And when next time I look at the page, a XSS vulnerability is pop out. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78632303/209643122-6d50d44e-2c1f-49d8-8ce4-e0846c492dae.png) Steps to reproduce the behavior Details can be seen in the following docx.

| This "attack" is very unlikely to happen. you need to access the db and then edit db column, but who would edit the lenght of acronym ??? And then you need to have admin privileges to exploit it  I will add a limit but no panic :) |

| Jorani?  Thanks! I found it exploitable because there is already existed a SQL vuln([CVE-2022-34132](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6h75-gchv-vpxg "CVE-2022-34132")), so maybe the attacker can use it to control the db column. |
