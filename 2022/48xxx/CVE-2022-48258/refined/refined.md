  "cveId": "CVE-2022-48258",
  "description": "In Eternal Terminal 6.2.1, etserver and etclient have world-readable logfiles.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `etserver` and `etclient` applications create log files in `/tmp` with world-readable permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The log files are created with permissions that allow other users on the system to read them.",
      "The predictable nature of the filenames makes it easier for attackers to target those files."
    ],
    "impact": "Information exposure, as other users on the system can read the log files and potentially glean sensitive information, including client IDs and passkeys.",
        "attackVectors": {
            "local": "A local attacker can read the world-readable log files, or pre-create or symlink them to cause a denial of service.",
            "network": "Although not directly a network attack, the exposed log information could aid attackers in subsequent network attacks by revealing client IDs and potentially other sensitive data."
        },
     "requiredCapabilities": {
            "local": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system where `etserver` or `etclient` is running.",
            "network": "None for direct exploitation of this vulnerability but it can be used as an attack vector."
