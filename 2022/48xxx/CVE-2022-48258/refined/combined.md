Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora Linux 37 on 2023-12-05. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a 'version' of '37'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, change the 'version'  to a later Fedora Linux version. Note that the version field may be hidden. Click the "Show advanced fields" button if you do not see it.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora Linux 37 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora Linux, you are encouraged to change the 'version' to a later version prior to this bug being closed.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2161251#c5)  Aoife Moloney    2023-12-07 14:55:39 UTC  ``` Fedora Linux 37 entered end-of-life (EOL) status on 2023-12-05.  Fedora Linux 37 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora Linux please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. Note that the version field may be hidden. Click the "Show advanced fields" button if you do not see the version field.  If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against an active release.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2161251#c6)  Michel Lind    2024-04-25 23:29:13 UTC  ``` Reopening   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2161251#c7)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-01 04:18:59 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2024-94a155818c (et-6.2.8-1.fc39) has been submitted as an update to Fedora 39. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2024-94a155818c>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2161251#c8)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-01 04:19:10 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2024-b745c97f4b (et-6.2.8-1.fc40) has been submitted as an update to Fedora 40. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2024-b745c97f4b>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2161251#c9)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-01 04:19:20 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2024-90aea0505b (et-6.2.8-1.el9) has been submitted as an update to Fedora EPEL 9. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2024-90aea0505b>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2161251#c10)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-01 04:19:31 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2024-bd9e67c117 (et-6.2.8-1.fc38) has been submitted as an update to Fedora 38. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2024-bd9e67c117>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2161251#c11)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-02 00:40:05 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2024-90aea0505b (et-6.2.8-1.el9) has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 9 stable repository.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora Linux 37 on 2023-12-05. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a 'version' of '37'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, change the 'version'  to a later Fedora Linux version. Note that the version field may be hidden. Click the "Show advanced fields" button if you do not see it.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora Linux 37 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora Linux, you are encouraged to change the 'version' to a later version prior to this bug being closed.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2161247#c5)  Aoife Moloney    2023-12-07 14:55:35 UTC  ``` Fedora Linux 37 entered end-of-life (EOL) status on 2023-12-05.  Fedora Linux 37 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora Linux please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. Note that the version field may be hidden. Click the "Show advanced fields" button if you do not see the version field.  If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against an active release.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2161247#c6)  Michel Lind    2024-04-25 23:31:10 UTC  ``` reopening   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2161247#c7)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-01 04:18:56 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2024-94a155818c (et-6.2.8-1.fc39) has been submitted as an update to Fedora 39. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2024-94a155818c>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2161247#c8)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-01 04:18:58 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2024-b745c97f4b (et-6.2.8-1.fc40) has been submitted as an update to Fedora 40. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2024-b745c97f4b>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2161247#c9)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-01 04:18:59 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2024-90aea0505b (et-6.2.8-1.el9) has been submitted as an update to Fedora EPEL 9. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2024-90aea0505b>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2161247#c10)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-01 04:19:00 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2024-bd9e67c117 (et-6.2.8-1.fc38) has been submitted as an update to Fedora 38. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2024-bd9e67c117>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2161247#c11)  Fedora Update System    2024-05-02 00:40:01 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2024-90aea0505b (et-6.2.8-1.el9) has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 9 stable repository.

```

can we at least log the filename? it does not seem appropriate to use FATAL\_FAIL in anything other than tests (and even then it would produce hard-to-action failures).

Sorry, something went wrong.

Subject: EternalTerminal: Review report and findings (predictable /tmp file
 paths and file permission issues, 3 CVEs)

Hello list,

this is a report about a review of the EternalTerminal [1] codebase I
performed and three CVE assignments that happened in this context.
EternalTerminal is an SSH-like remote terminal solution that survives
connection loss and IP roaming. Following is my detailed report which is based
on the v6.2.1 upstream release.

I publish this report today, because the maximum embargo period of 90 days we
offered upstream has been exceeded. Not all issues mentioned in this report
are currently fixed upstream.

[1]: <https://github.com/MisterTea/EternalTerminal>

1) Review Motivation
====================

There have been a number of CVE assignments for EternalTerminal in August
2022:

CVE-2022-24952: DoS triggered remotely by invalid sequence numbers.
CVE-2022-24951: race condition allows local attacker to hijack IPC socket.
CVE-2022-24950: race condition allows authenticated attacker to hijack other
                user's SSH authorization socket.

In light of these issues I have been asked to have a closer look if there
might linger more issues in the project.

2) Basic Design Overview
========================

EternalTerminal initially uses a regular SSH connection to establish a 256 bit
shared secret between client and server. The client invokes the executable
`etterminal` on the remote node via SSH. This creates a random `clientid` /
`passkey` pair which is passed (still on the remote node) to the privileged
`etserver` component via a UNIX domain socket. At this point the `etserver`
component has an entry for the `clientid` and its copy of the shared key for
that client. The `clientid` / `passkey` pair is also written to stdout and
consumed via the SSH connection by the `et` client process. This way the
client gets its copy of the shared key. The `etterminal` helper program on the
server side then backgrounds and keeps running. It implements the PTY that
will later be used for running the EternalTerminal session.

In a second step the client talks to the `etserver` remote instance via IP
port 2022. A Google Protocol Buffer based protocol is used here. An initial
cleartext message is sent that just states the `clientid` and the protocol
version of the client. If the server accepts the parameters then both parties
switch over to a libsodium secretbox encryption based on the 256 bit shared
secret `passkey` and an incrementally increasing nonce value. The server now
attaches the session to the PTY provided by the instance of `etterminal` that
was started earlier via regular SSH.

If the connection is lost then the client can connect to the remote node on
port 2022 again using the same `clientid` to resume a terminal session.

3) Issues
=========

3.a) World Readable Logfiles and Predictable Logfile Names in /tmp
------------------------------------------------------------------

Both etserver and etclient create logfiles directly in the "/tmp"
directory. For reference some example files:

    $ ls -lh /tmp/etserver*
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 393 Nov 18 13:44 /tmp/etserver-2022-11-18_13-44.log
    -rw-r----- 1 root root   0 Nov 18 13:44 /tmp/etserver_stderr_2022-11-18_01-44

    $ ls -lh /tmp/etclient*
    -rw-r--r-- 1 someuser users 1.8K Nov 18 13:45 /tmp/etclient-2022-11-18_13_44_52.log
    -rw-r----- 1 someuser users   78 Nov 18 13:44 /tmp/etclient_stderr_2022-11-18_01-44

This has the following problems:

- The stdout logfile is world-readable and the stderr logfile is still group
  readable. This can pose an information leak, depending on the logger
  configuration and what is exactly output during runtime by etserver and
  etclient. Other users on the system can deduce what is happening this way,
  including the `clientid`s used.

- The filenames of these logfiles are pretty predictable, with only minute
  timestamp granularity on the server and second timestamp granularity on the
  client side. This means a local attacker can prepare symlink attacks or
  precreate these files. Luckily on most current Linux systems this is prevented
  by the Linux kernel's symlink protection in world writable directories. Even
  with the protection it still poses a denial-of-service risk, because the
  EternalTerminal processes can fail to start if these files are precreated by
  other users. Without the kernel protection, file creation in privileged
  locations and logfile spoofing would be the impact.

### Upstream Fix

Upstream addressed some of the problems (open() flags, creation mode) in this
commit which is part of release 6.2.2:

<https://github.com/MisterTea/EternalTerminal/commit/92c4c6ada445c1925a8b397f4171ca7735cbda16>

### Further Suggestions

- Ideally the logfiles should go into a dedicated directory e.g. in
  /var/log/et for the server side.
- For the client side a set of logfiles can be kept in the home
  directory, but old logs should be deleted after some time.
  Alternatively client logs can be placed into `/run/user/<uid>/et-logs`
  or a similar location.

### CVE Assignments

Mitre assigned the following CVEs:

- CVE-2022-48257 for the "predictable log filename" aspect.
- CVE-2022-48258 for the "world readable log files" aspect.

3.b) TelemetryService Uses Fixed Paths in /tmp
----------------------------------------------

The TelemetryService class is instantiated using a database path in
"/tmp/.sentry-native-et" for the client and "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver" for
the server. This is a directory within which further files and directories
will be queried and created during runtime.

Similar to issue 3.a) this allows other users on the system to pre-create this
parent directory which will be used by the `etclient` or `etserver` process.

For example in etserver the following system call sequence with regard
to this database directory can be observed during startup:

```
    mkdir("/tmp//.sentry-native-etserver", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
    readlink("/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver", 0x7ffda847e750, 1023) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
    openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run.lock", O_RDONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 5
    newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run.lock", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}, 0) = 0
    mkdir("/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
    mkdir("/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run", 0700) = 0
    openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/user-consent", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/last_crash", 0x7ffda847fdb0, 0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_CLOEXEC|O_DIRECTORY) = 6
    newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0700, st_size=40, ...}, 0) = 0
    openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run.lock", O_RDONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 7
    newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run.lock", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}, 0) = 0
    newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run/session.json", 0x7ffda847faa0, 0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    unlink("/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run/session.json") = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run/session.json", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0664) = 6
    openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver/a5323119-72df-430c-ad87-38054a86d7e1.run/session.json", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0664) = 6
```

A local attacker can create "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver" with mode 0777
before `etserver` starts. The attacker will then control the complete
directory tree. Even though the TelemetryService backend uses UUIDs, they can
be deduced by waiting for the `.run.lock` file being created, from this time
on the local attacker knows the UUID and can try to win a race condition by
pre-creating also the `<UUID>.run` directory. The information placed there
will then leak to the attacker, but the attacker can also compromise the data
integrity by changing it.

Again, without the Linux kernel's symlink protection mechanism this
issue would provide a lot of possibilities to exploit symlink attacks. And in
the more deeply nested file paths below "/tmp/.sentry-native-etserver" the
symlink protection might not even be triggered.

### Upstream Fix

I do not know of any upstream efforts to fix this.

### Suggested Fix

- The client should create this directory in "/run/user/<UID>/sentry-native-et"
  instead.
- The server should create this directory in e.g. "/run/etserver/sentry-native-etserver"
  instead.

### CVE Assignments

Mitre assigned the following CVE:

- CVE-2023-23558 for the fixed "/tmp" path usage of the TelemetryService component

3.c) Registration of Server Sessions via Local IPC Socket Allows for Simple Reverse Shells
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The socket on the `etserver` side at "/var/run/etserver.idpasskey.fifo" is
world accessible and allows any local user to register a future session with
EternalTerminal that can later be accessed remotely on port 2022. To do so
the local user only needs to get out the clientid and idpasskey registered at
the socket, which can also have static values, because the clientid and
passkey are selected by the client side, not by the privileged server side.

Usually only certain user accounts are allowed to log into a machine, based on
policies found e.g. in the SSH configuration, PAM stack configuration and so
on. Especially users without a valid account (no valid shell set, no password
assigned, locked, etc.) should not be able to log into a machine neither
locally nor remotely. These login policies can easily be circumvented by using
the `etserver` features.

A reverse shell can of course also be created in other ways as soon as a
local user account can execute arbitrary code. What makes it special
with `etserver` is that it will be very well hidden since it is using a
regular facility of the system. What makes this more problematic is that
there is no time limit, a local user account can register such a session
and access it days or event months later remotely, provided that the
`etserver` instance isn't restarted.

Since all that is needed to register a session is access to the local IPC
socket, this even has the potential to allow isolated container processes to
escape network isolation. Even if the process has a detached networking stack
(separate Linux network namespace), the mere access to `etserver`'s IPC socket
allows to create a remote connection to the container from the outside.
Depending on container configurations or other vulnerabilities in container
setups this can be a realistic threat.

### CVE Assignments

Since this is not a tangible vulnerability on its own I did not request a
dedicated CVE for it. I still believe that the topic should be addressed in
some form.

### Upstream Fix

I do not know of any upstream efforts to improve this aspect of
EternalTerminal.

## Suggested Fixes

- Ideally there would be a tighter coupling between the SSH authentication
  part and the connection to port 2022. For example a small PAM module could
  write out a kind of auth cookie during SSH login for the user account context
  that will be verified again once the connection on port 2022 is coming in.
  This should also be time limited so that the session doesn't remain valid
  forever but only for a few minutes or so, if no one actually connects to
  port 2022.

4) Other Suggestions
====================

4.a) srand(1) Calls
-------------------

Currently the following source locations (corresponding to the three main
programs) contain a call to `srand(1)`:

    terminal/TerminalServerMain.cpp:    srand(1);
    terminal/TerminalClientMain.cpp:    srand(1);
    terminal/TerminalMain.cpp:    srand(1);

Luckily the C `rand()` function is only used for non-sensitive things in the
codebase as far as I could see. Still this is bad practice, especially in a
program that is also doing cryptography. Things could get mixed up in the
future. I suggest to create a common init function that properly seeds the
random number generator using real random data e.g. obtained from libsodium.

### Upstream Fix

I do not know of any upstream efforts to improve on this.

4.b) Telemetry Enabled by Default
---------------------------------

I found it a bit irritating that the telemetry service is sending out
crash data by default without explicit user opt-in. Even though it is
anonymised I don't think an OSS program should send out data to third party
remote servers without explicit consent.

There should be at least a compile time option to influence this default
so that integrators of the package can decide which way to go here.

### Upstream Fix

Upstream made the Telemetry opt-in (changed the defaults) via this commit
which is part of release 6.2.2:

<https://github.com/MisterTea/EternalTerminal/commit/7289e04475a8418d376cbc7ecbcc580e23c42bb7>

4.c) Busy-wait Loop in TerminalServer::run()
--------------------------------------------

Currently the while loop there `select()`s with a timeout of 10.000
usec. I can see no purpose for that in the code, but it creates notable
CPU load even in idle in etserver and also makes analyzing the program
harder due to the massive load of system calls resulting from the busy loop.

### Upstream Fix

I do not know of any upstream efforts to improve on this.

4.d) TerminalUserInfo in etserver Receives User Controlled uid/gid Values
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the `etterminal` program sends the client's uid and gid values to
the privileged `etserver` via a local UNIX domain socket. This information
ends up in the TerminalUserInfo protobuf structure. Currently `etserver` uses
this information only for the jump host configuration in a non-sensitive way
as far as I can see.

For prudence I suggest to change this logic though. The uid and gid values can
be forged by the client and future code changes might miss this fact and
consider this information to be trusted. The safe way to obtain this
information would be to use the `SO_PEERCRED` socket option on the UNIX domain
socket connection on the privileged end. This way the information is obtained
from the kernel and can be trusted.

If it is intentional that clients can set this data then naming the fields
differently and documenting that this is untrusted data is recommended.

### Upstream Fix

I do not know of any upstream efforts to improve on this.

Timeline
========

2022-11-18: I shared an initial report with the upstream author(s) offering
            coordinated disclosure according to the openSUSE disclosure
            policy. Some discussions about fixing parts of the issues started
            but died down again.
            No statement about the desired duration of an embargo period (or
            any at all) was made by upstream. No confirmation of the
            individual issues or wishes regarding CVE assigments have been
            stated.
2023-01-09: I learned from upstream that information about issue 3.a) was
            already public in form of an upstream GitHub pull request. I asked
            about plans for fixes for the remaining findings and about
            upstream's desires for a prolonged embargo period and CVE
            assignments but got no answers.
2023-01-13: I requested the three CVEs mentioned in this report from Mitre for
            the issues that I deemed critical and concrete enough to assign
            CVEs.
2023-01-18: Upstream released version 6.2.2 containing fixes for issue 3.a),
            i.e. for CVE-2022-48257 and CVE-2022-48258.
2023-02-16: The maximum embargo period we offer (90 days) has been exceeded
            and lacking further details from upstream I published all
            information I have.
