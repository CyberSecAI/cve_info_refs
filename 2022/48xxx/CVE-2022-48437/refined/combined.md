Store errors that result from leaf certificate verification.

```
In the case that a verification callback is installed that tells the
verifier to continue when a certificate is invalid (e.g. expired),
any error resulting from the leaf certificate verification is not stored
and made available post verification, resulting in an incorrect error being
returned.

Also perform leaf certificate verification prior to adding the chain, which
avoids a potential memory leak (as noted by tb@).

Issue reported by Ilya Shipitsin, who encountered haproxy regress failures.

We have released LibreSSL 3.6.1, which will be arriving in the
LibreSSL directory of your local OpenBSD mirror soon.
It includes the following fixes:
- Custom verification callbacks could cause the X.509 verifier to
fail to store errors resulting from leaf certificate verification.
Reported by Ilya Shipitsin.
- Unbreak ASN.1 indefinite length encoding.
Reported by Niklas Hallqvist.
- Fix endian detection on macOS
Reported by jiegec on Github
The LibreSSL project continues improvement of the codebase to reflect modern,
safe programming practices. We welcome feedback and improvements from the
broader community. Thanks to all of the contributors who helped make this
release possible.

OpenBSD 7.2 errata 001, October 24, 2022:
Custom verification callbacks could cause the X.509 verifier to fail
to store errors resulting from leaf certificate verification.
Apply by doing:
signify -Vep /etc/signify/openbsd-72-base.pub -x 001\_x509.patch.sig \
-m - | (cd /usr/src && patch -p0)
And then rebuild and install libcrypto and unwind:
cd /usr/src/lib/libcrypto
make obj
make includes
make
make install
