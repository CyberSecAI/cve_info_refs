The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48345.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `sanitize-url` library was not properly sanitizing URLs that used HTML encoded colons (e.g., `javascript&colon;alert('xss');`) or HTML encoded tabs (e.g., `javasc&Tab;ript:alert('XSS');`) within the URL, which could be used to bypass the URL sanitization and inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
- The library did not account for HTML entities used to represent characters like colon and tab in URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code into websites via URLs, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This could allow them to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface web pages.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting malicious URLs containing HTML encoded colons or tabs and tricking users into clicking on such links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft URLs and insert them into web pages or transmit them to victims.
