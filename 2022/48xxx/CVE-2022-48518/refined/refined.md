Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-48518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the signature verification in the iaware system being initialized later than when system broadcasts are sent. This timing issue allows for a race condition to occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Signature Verification Bypass:** The delayed initialization of signature verification in the iaware system allows a window of opportunity to bypass the verification process during system startup.
- **Race Condition:** The timing difference creates a race condition where malicious apps can exploit the lack of signature verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious App Startup:** Successful exploitation enables malicious apps to start upon power-on by spoofing the package names of apps present in the startup trust list.
- **System Performance Degradation:**  The unauthorized startup of malicious apps can negatively affect overall system performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious App Installation:** The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the device.
- **System Startup:** The vulnerability is triggered during the system startup process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious application on the targeted device.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious app to spoof package names in the startup trustlist

**Affected Versions:**
- EMUI 12.0.1
- EMUI 12.0.0
