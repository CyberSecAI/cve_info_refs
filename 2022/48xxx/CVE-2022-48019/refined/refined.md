Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a privilege escalation flaw within the anti-cheat system used in the PC version of the game "Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space." This anti-cheat system is a third-party component embedded within the game.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The core issue is that a malicious program can exploit the anti-cheat system to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the user's computer.
- **Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM):** The provided github repository for CVE-2022-42046 details how the vulnerable driver (wfshbr64.sys or wfshbr32.sys) allows a user to perform bitwise operations on the `EPROCESS` structure of the process, effectively elevating the process's protection level. Specifically the `EPROCESS.Protection` and `EPROCESS.SignatureLevel` flags can be manipulated.
- **Insecure Driver Implementation:** The driver has flaws in how it handles IRP (I/O Request Packets) and context processes, with unnecessary checks, and insecure practices such as using the IRP object after it has been freed.
- **Inadequate Verification Logic:** The developer tried to fix the vulnerability by adding verification logic to the driver, but this logic was easily bypassed, demonstrating an insufficient understanding of the security implications.
- **Signed by Microsoft:** This was also concerning as the vulnerable driver was signed by Microsoft indicating it was submitted through the Microsoft Hardware Program, and should have had more scrutiny.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows a malicious program to gain the highest level of privileges on the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With SYSTEM privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code, install malware, manipulate the operating system, or steal sensitive data.
- **Information Leakage:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information can lead to data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Program:**  The vulnerability is triggered by running a specifically crafted malicious program. This malicious program interacts with the vulnerable anti-cheat component of the game.
- **Local Exploitation:** The exploit is local, meaning the attacker must have a way to run their malicious program on the target computer. This could be by tricking the user into installing it or via other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Run Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the targeted system.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Driver:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable driver's operations and the ability to craft requests to exploit it, potentially using the PoC available online.

**Additional Information from GitHub repository:**
-   The vulnerable driver (`wfshbr64.sys`, `wfshbr32.sys`) is signed by Microsoft.
-   The driver contains functionality for bitwise operations with arbitrary `EPROCESS` offset and flags, which is used for privilege escalation.
-  A initial Proof of Concept(PoC) was developed and later defeated by an additional verification. The verification was based on bit counting, which was then bypassed using a clever workaround by manipulating the offset to adjust it in the bitwise operators.
-   The repository contains PoC code in both C++ and Rust.
- The github page details how the developers of the driver made several errors in the implementation, like not using `ObRegisterCallbacks`, referencing IRP after completion, and an unnecessary null check.

**Affected Versions:**
-   Japanese PC version of "Another Eden" prior to Ver 3.0.20
-   Global (Steam) PC version of "Another Eden" prior to Ver 2.14.200

**Fix:**
-   The vulnerability is fixed in Japanese PC version Ver 3.0.50 and Global PC version Ver 2.14.300. Users are advised to update their game to these versions or later.
