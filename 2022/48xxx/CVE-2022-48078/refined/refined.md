- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The issue is caused by a stack overflow in the `BuildFromCode` function within `ASTree.cpp`. This occurs due to excessive recursion when processing a specially crafted Python bytecode file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a stack overflow. This occurs when the recursion depth exceeds the stack's capacity.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit leads to a crash of the `pycdc` application. This could potentially be leveraged for denial-of-service attacks against systems utilizing `pycdc`.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a malicious Python bytecode file specifically designed to cause excessive recursion in `pycdc`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted Python bytecode file as input to `pycdc`. This would require the attacker to either control the input source of pycdc, or to convince a user to process the crafted file.
