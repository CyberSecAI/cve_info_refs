The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48325.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input data before displaying it in the application's views. The CodeIgniter framework's default configuration has global XSS filtering disabled, and the application does not properly sanitize inputs before saving them in the database and outputting them to views.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application directly uses user-provided input from POST and GET requests without sanitizing it for potentially malicious scripts.
- **Vulnerable Input Fields:**  Specific examples include the 'telefone' field in `Clientes.php` and `Relatorios.php` controllers, and the 'pesquisa' field in `arquivos.php` view.
- **Deprecated framework configuration:** CodeIgniter's global XSS filtering is disabled by default and deprecated which can lead to vulnerabilities if developers do not sanitize input/output manually.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into input fields, which would then be stored in the database. When the application displays this data in a user's browser, the injected script would execute, potentially allowing the attacker to:
  - Steal user session cookies
  - Redirect users to malicious sites
  - Deface the application
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
-  Manipulating POST requests for fields such as 'telefone' when creating or editing data.
-  Manipulating GET requests for fields such as 'pesquisa' when displaying search results.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit input to the application. This means they need to be able to access the forms in the application where input data can be entered (e.g. through the web interface).
- They need to be able to insert malicious code into the input fields.
