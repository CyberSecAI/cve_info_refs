Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-48111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `check_login` function of the S.I.R.I. s.r.l WI400 web interface for IBM Power Systems (AS/400).
- The application does not properly sanitize the `f` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-supplied input (the `f` parameter) directly into the HTML response without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they visit a crafted URL.
- **Session Cookie Theft:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal the user's session cookie.
- **Account Impersonation:** Once an attacker has the session cookie, they can log into the system and impersonate the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URLs:** Attackers can create malicious URLs containing the XSS payload in the `f` parameter.
- **Phishing:** These crafted URLs can be distributed through phishing attacks or other means of social engineering to lure victims to click the link.
- **No Authentication Required**: Exploitation does not require authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** An attacker needs to create URLs with the malicious JavaScript payload.
- **Ability to Distribute Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs a way to get users to click the crafted URLs, such as through phishing emails or social engineering tactics.
- **No direct access required**: The attacker does not need access to the target system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects WI400 versions 8 through 11 (inclusive).
- The vendor, SIRI, was notified and worked with Yarix for a coordinated disclosure.
- The vendor recommends enabling "safe mode" or updating to the latest version as mitigations.
- A proof-of-concept was created using an XMLHttpRequest to exfiltrate the session cookie.
- The vulnerability was identified during a penetration test.
- Shodan was used to identify other vulnerable installations.
