- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An access issue within the APFS (Apple File System).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Insufficient access restrictions allowed an app to potentially access user-sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An application may be able to gain access to user-sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application may exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to execute a malicious application on the target system.
