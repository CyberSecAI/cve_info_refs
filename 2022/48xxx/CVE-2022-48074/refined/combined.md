## NoMachine 8.2.3 now available for download

Luxembourg, November 8th, 2022

NoMachine makes available updated packages for version 8 to fix some issues affecting the previous releases, including errors during the installation of Windows packages at 64bit and WebRTC sessions not working on Chrome.

This version provides also some improvements:

**Audio support on PipeWire sound-based systems**
Initial implementation for supporting audio based on PipeWire sound server in physical desktop sessions.

**Extending user groups**
The use of user groups, either system or NoMachine groups, is now available in all commercial products, including NoMachine Enterprise Desktop and NoMachine Workstation.

**Updates to cluster commands**
The 'nxserver --clusterupdate' command is renamed into 'nxserver --clusteredit' to better fit naming convention. This command is now able to synchronize also changes to nxhtd settings between the master and the slave servers.

**Unified logs for the webserver, nxhtd**
Since this version, the nxhtd-error.log and nxhtd-access.log file are unified in a unique file, nxhtd.log.

**Kerberos ticket re-delegation for password authentication and the remote nodes**
For connections by NX protocol, Kerberos tickets are now updated (redelegated) inside the session also when virtual desktops run on remote nodes. Re-delegation works also when the ticket is obtained by pam\_krb5 module during password authentication.

The complete list of fixes included in this 8.2.3 release are:

TR10T10631 - Error during installation of 64 bit packages on Windows 7
TR07T10566 - NoMachine WebRTC sessions don't work on Chrome 100.0.4896.127 or later
TR10T10627 - Screen blanking is not deactivated on macOS12 upon user's disconnection
TR10T10655 - Mouse scrolling doesn't work on macOS 13 Ventura
TR10T10630 - Upgrading from SBTS v8.0 to v8.1 doesn't work if the subscription is v.7
TR10T10648 - Wrong IP addresses broadcast despite different NXdListenAddress server configuration key values
TR10T10632 - 'Automatically check for updates' checkbox doesn't work properly
TR08T10572 - A new Kerberos ticket is not obtained when reconnecting the virtual desktop (connection by SSH)
TR10T10634 - Client doesn't allow to configure a custom application command
TR10R09868 - Copied password from KeePassX/C add additional characters
TR10T10645 - Incorrect color is chosen for the !M icon on a desktop with Black Glass theme
TR10T10654 - Incorrect command to start the desktop environment on Raspberry Pi
TR09T10619 - Misleading output while installing unnecessary license in NoMachine 8
TR11T10662 - NoMachine server stops responding after clearing statistics for file transfer
TR11T10661 - The desktop owner cannot interact with session when view-only is set
TR04Q09226 - User nx is visible in login window on macOS after upgrade from 12 Monterey to 13 Ventura
TR11T10672 - Connection files .NXS can be configured to execute arbitrary commands
TR11T10670 - The user forwarded to the node of a Cloud Server has administrator properties set
