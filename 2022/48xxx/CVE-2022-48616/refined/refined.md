  "CVE-2022-48616": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `OPS_Cfg_ScriptAssistInstall` function, where the filename of the script is used to construct a `chmod` command using `sprintf_s` without any prior validation. This allows for command injection because the filename is not properly sanitized before being included in the command.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
       "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands as root on the device.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by uploading a file with a malicious filename via FTP and then configuring a script assistant via the web portal or Telnet.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have valid credentials to access the device's management portal via web interface and/or Telnet. They also need to be able to upload files via FTP."
