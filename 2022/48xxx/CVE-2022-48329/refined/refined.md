The provided content is related to commits in the MISP project, specifically around changes to how ordering of results is handled in `GalaxyCluster`, `Workflow`, and `Attribute` models, which is likely related to CVE-2022-48329.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the 'order' parameter when fetching data from the `GalaxyCluster`, `Workflow`, and `Attribute` models. This is done through the introduction of a new `findOrder()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a potential SQL injection vulnerability. By controlling the `order` parameter, an attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input for the `order` parameter, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive data stored in the MISP database by crafting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By using computationally expensive queries or resource-intensive operations, the attacker could potentially cause a denial of service.
*   **System compromise:** In severe cases, could lead to underlying system compromise if the database user has excessive rights.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP request parameters:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests where an attacker can manipulate the `order` parameter to inject malicious SQL statements when fetching `GalaxyCluster`, `Workflow`, and `Attribute` records via the APIs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to MISP APIs:** The attacker needs to have access to the MISP APIs which allow for fetching of `GalaxyCluster`, `Workflow`, and `Attribute` records, which could be public depending on configurations.
*   **Knowledge of MISP data model:** Some knowledge of the MISP database schema would be beneficial for crafting effective SQL injection attacks, although basic SQL injection attempts could still be successful without in-depth knowledge.

**Technical Details:**

The commit `a73c1c461bc6f8a048eae92b5e99823afd892d1e` modifies the `fetchGalaxyClusters` function in `app/Model/GalaxyCluster.php`, the `fetchWorkflows` function in `app/Model/Workflow.php`, and the `findLog` function in `app/Plugin/Assets/models/behaviors/LogableBehavior.php` to utilize the `findOrder` function to sanitize the order parameter.
The commit `afbe08d256d609eee5195c5b0003cfb723ae7af1` modifies `fetchAttributes` function in `app/Model/Attribute.php` to utilize the `findOrder` function as well.
The `findOrder` function is intended to prevent SQL injection by validating the fields used in the order by clause.

The diffs show that before the fix, the code directly passed the user-provided `order` parameter to the database query.
```php
if (isset($options['order'])) {
    $params['order'] = $options['order'];
}
```

After the fix, the code uses the `findOrder` function which checks that the order by clause contains only the permitted fields for each model.
```php
if (isset($options['order'])) {
    $params['order'] = $options['order'];
    if (!empty($options['order'])) {
        $options['order'] = $this->findOrder(
            $options['order'],
            'GalaxyCluster',
            ['id', 'event_id', 'version', 'type', 'value', 'distribution', 'orgc_id', 'org_id', 'tag_name', 'galaxy_id']
        );
    }
}
```
and
```php
if (!empty($options['order'])) {
    $options['order'] = $Model->findOrder(
        $options['order'],
        'Attribute',
        ['id', 'action', 'model_id', 'model', 'ip', 'org', 'email']
    );
}
```

The vulnerability is that without proper sanitization in the `findOrder` method, users can inject SQL by manipulating the `order` parameter.
