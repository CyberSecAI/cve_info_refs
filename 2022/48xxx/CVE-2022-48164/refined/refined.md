Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control on the `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` endpoint of the WAVLINK QUANTUM T8 - AC3000 MU-MIMO Tri-band (WL-WN533A8) device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is that the `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` endpoint does not require authentication to access.
- **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint leaks sensitive information including device configurations and admin credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:**  By obtaining admin credentials, an attacker can gain full control of the device.
- **Data Exposure:** The attacker can access all configuration data and logs stored in the device.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With control over the device, an attacker could potentially use it as a pivot point for further attacks on the network it's connected to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the affected device. This could be a local network or remotely, depending on the device's configuration.
- **Direct Request to vulnerable endpoint**: By crafting an HTTP GET request to `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh`, an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device.
- No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in firmware version M33A8.V5030.190716 of the WL-WN533A8 device.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) shows that accessing the vulnerable URL results in downloading configuration files and admin credentials.
