Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-48356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an "Unstrict input parameter verification" issue within the facial recognition module. This means the module does not properly validate the input it receives, leading to potential issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper input validation in the facial recognition module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the facial recognition feature becoming unavailable. This implies a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the facial recognition functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not detailed in this document, but it involves providing crafted input to the facial recognition module that bypasses the input parameter validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker likely needs to have some form of access to the facial recognition system to provide the crafted input, but this document does not specify any further requirement.

**Affected Versions:**
- EMUI 12.0.0
