- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of hostnames in TLS certificates due to a misuse of the `javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory` API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The services, including `sls-logging`, were not properly verifying hostnames in TLS certificates, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Specifically,  `sls-logging` was vulnerable in a particular configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful man-in-the-middle attack would allow an attacker to intercept, read, or modify network communications to and from the affected service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious attacker in a privileged network position through man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a privileged network position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
