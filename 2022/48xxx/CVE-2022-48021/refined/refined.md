- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zammad frontend communicates with the server via web sockets or AJAX. A specially crafted message sent by an attacker to the server is then broadcast to all active frontends. These frontends then react to the malicious payload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the lack of sufficient input sanitization or validation of messages received from the client, which allows an attacker to inject a malicious payload through the web socket or AJAX connection and force all connected clients to execute it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the frontend and, potentially, Privilege Escalation on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could send a specially crafted message to the server using a web socket connection or AJAX requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send messages to the Zammad server, implying having an active session. The attacker also requires a means to craft the malicious message to be sent.
