Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `/medicines/profile.php` endpoint. The `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can retrieve the contents of the database, including sensitive information like user credentials (usernames and password hashes).
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete records in the database, which could affect data integrity.
*   **Potential OS Command Execution:** Under certain circumstances, SQLi can be leveraged to execute OS commands, leading to further escalation of attacks.
*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization:**  SQL injection can be used to bypass the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious request to the `/medicines/profile.php` endpoint via the `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   The attacker injects SQL code into the `id` parameter. For example: `http://localhost/RemoteClinic/medicines/profile.php?id=30'` or `http://localhost/RemoteClinic/medicines/profile.php?id=30'--`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
*   The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft the injection payloads.
* The attacker does not need to be logged in according to the steps provided in the report.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1.  Login in Application as Doctor.
2.  Click on Directory.
3.  Click on any medicine profile.
4.  PUT single quote in medicine profile endpoint.
5.  Balance the Query to Remove Errors.
6.  Find Total Numbers of Columns.
7.  Find Vulnerable Columns.
8.  Now Extract **Current Database** and **Current User**.
9.  Extract All **Users** and **Passwords** (md5 hash).
