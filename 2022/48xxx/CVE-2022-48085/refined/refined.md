Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Workspace Name" field within the Softr platform. The application stores the provided Workspace name, including HTML tags, in the backend database. When this name is used in emails, the stored HTML is injected into the email content without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is HTML injection. Malicious HTML code inserted into the workspace name is directly included in outgoing emails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Email Manipulation:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML into emails sent by the Softr platform. This could lead to a range of malicious outcomes.
*   **Phishing Attacks:**  Malicious actors could use HTML injection to embed links in the email, redirecting recipients to fake login pages or other harmful resources.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the email client and injected HTML, there's a risk of accessing sensitive information or leaking email content.
*   **Account Compromise:** By tricking users into clicking malicious links, attackers could potentially gain access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Workspace Name Field:** The attacker manipulates the "Workspace Name" field of their account within the Softr platform, injecting malicious HTML code.
*   **Email Delivery:** The vulnerability is triggered when an email is sent by the platform that contains the malicious workspace name. This occurs when a user invites a collaborator to a workspace.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Softr Account:** An attacker needs a valid account on the Softr platform.
*   **Workspace Creation:** They need the ability to create a workspace.
*   **Payload Creation:** They need to be able to craft the HTML payload to be injected.
*   **Collaboration Invitation:** They need the ability to invite collaborators to trigger the email with the injected payload.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit steps are:
1.  Navigate to the Softr dashboard.
2.  Create a new Workspace.
3.  Set the workspace name to a malicious HTML payload e.g. `"></svg>//[“‘` →<a href= “<http://google.com>">Click Me</a></div>`.
4.  Invite a collaborator to the workspace.
5.  The collaborator receives an email with the HTML payload injected within the body.
