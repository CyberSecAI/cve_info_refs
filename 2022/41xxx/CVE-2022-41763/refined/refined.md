Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-41763:

**CVE-2022-41763 â Nokia AMS**

*   **Vulnerability Description:** Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code (CWE-95).
*   **Software Version:** v9.7.05
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize the `ipAddress` variable, which is used in a dynamically evaluated code context within the PING function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Code injection through a variable used in dynamic code evaluation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote, authenticated attacker can inject code that will be executed on the server. The privileges of the command executed depend on the user context of the service. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a remote user with valid authentication to the AMS server.
    *   The attack is performed by modifying the `ipAddress` variable through the debugger of the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the AMS server, and the ability to use a debugger to modify variables on the server.

**Summary of CVE-2022-41763:**
This vulnerability allows authenticated users to inject code into the `ipAddress` variable which is then processed by the application, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated on the server.
