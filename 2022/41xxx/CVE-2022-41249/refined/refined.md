**CVE-2022-41249 (CSRF) and CVE-2022-41250 (missing permission check) details:**

*   **Affected Plugin:** SCM HttpClient Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.5 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    *   This can allow attackers to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sending a request to the vulnerable form validation method, without proper permission checks.
    *   Crafting a malicious request to the form validation method to achieve CSRF.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
