SECURITY: Limit chat message char length ([#19207](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/19207))

```
Only allow maximum of 6000 characters for chat messages when they
are created or edited. A hidden setting can control this limit,
6000 is the default.

There is also a migration here to truncate any existing messages to
6000 characters if the message is already over that and if the
chat_messages table exists. We also set cooked_version to NULL
for those messages so we can identify them for rebake.
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
