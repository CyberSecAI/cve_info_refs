Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The TP-Link AX10v1 router's web application authentication method improperly handles previously accepted login messages. It does not implement adequate protection against replay attacks, allowing an attacker to reuse a captured authentication packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the lack of measures to prevent replay attacks. The web application accepts a replayed HTTP packet containing a previously successful login message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain a valid authentication token by replaying a captured authentication message. This token allows the attacker to log in as an administrator to the application.
*   **Full Administrative Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker administrative access to the router's web interface, allowing them to perform any administrative actions, potentially leading to further compromise of the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker must position themselves as a MitM, intercepting traffic between the web application (router's web interface) and a legitimate user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the router's web interface. This usually requires the attacker to be on the same local network as the victim or have a position in the network path to the router.
*   **Traffic Capture:** The attacker must capture a legitimate authentication message sent by the user to the web application.
*   **Traffic Replay:** The attacker needs to be able to resend the captured authentication message to the web application.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Product:** TP-Link AX10v1 (V1_211117 firmware).
*   **Patch:** V1_220401 firmware is mentioned as a patch.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A video, "replay-active-tp-link\_Ktu2kFUg.mp4", is referenced as a PoC.
