Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect inclusion of the `newsletter` relationship in the `/members/api/member/` API endpoint. This allows a member (unprivileged user) to modify newsletter settings, including the system-wide default newsletter. The `updateMemberData` function in `core/server/services/members/middleware.js` incorrectly trusts the `newsletter` dictionary in the request body.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control, allowing unauthenticated member accounts to modify newsletter settings they should not have access to.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Members can bypass intended restrictions on newsletter settings.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Through the ability to modify newsletter content, specifically the `footer_content` field, attackers can inject JavaScript, leading to stored XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Newsletter Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious content (links, images) into newsletters, potentially targeting subscribers with phishing attacks, malware, or exploit kit landing pages.
- **Stored XSS:** By injecting JavaScript, attackers can perform actions such as creating administrative accounts or stealing credentials when a user with administrative privileges views the newsletter content (Specifically, the default newsletter, as stated in the report).
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** By exploiting the stored XSS in newsletter content, attackers can gain administrative privileges. This is done by creating a new admin user through the stored XSS payload.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the `/members/api/member/` endpoint with manipulated `newsletter` data in the request body.
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
- **User Interaction (Limited):** While the initial attack vector does not require user interaction, some aspects of the exploit, such as the XSS attack, require an administrator to view the modified newsletter in order to trigger a stored XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User/Member Account:** The attacker needs only to be able to create a member account, which by default requires no admin approval.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Ghost versions 5.0.0 - 5.22.6 and 4.46.0-4.48.7. Patched versions are 5.22.7 and 4.48.8.
- The Talos report gives more specific details than the Github advisory, including the vulnerable code, and an example of how to exploit the stored XSS.
- The CVSS score is 9.6 according to Talos and 8.5 according to github.
