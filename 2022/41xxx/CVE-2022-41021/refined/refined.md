The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-41021.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of `sprintf` to copy user-controlled input into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper size checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates and special keywords to parse input. The `sprintf` function is then used to format the input into a fixed size buffer which leads to overflows when the input is too large.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary command execution on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is sending a specially-crafted network packet to the device's `DetranCLI` interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device and needs to have the knowledge of specific command templates to craft the malicious input. The CVSS score indicates that the attacker must have high privileges.

**Specific details for CVE-2022-41021:**
This specific vulnerability is within the `vpn l2tp advanced name with options` command. The vulnerable code snippet is:
```
sprintf(buff_0x100,"%d<%s<%d<%s<%s<%d<%s<%s",1,*argv,based_on_argv[1],atoi_argv[2],argv[3],based_on_argv[4],argv[5],"");
```
The vulnerability can be triggered with the command template:
```
vpn l2tp advanced name WORD dns (yes|no) mtu <128-16384> mru <128-16384> auth (on|off) password (WORD|null) options WORD
```
The vulnerability occurs because the `WORD` parameters are not checked for length and may overflow `buff_0x100`.
