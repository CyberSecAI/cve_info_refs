well its all in teh unexpected area so any decision is good.

Inspecting all usages there's a pattern of checking for an array, then if it's 4 and then either going for a default or calling SetPDFRectangleFromArray.

so that array check+ 4 check can be moved into SetPDFRectangleFromArray for better reuse and that it'd return status. then it's `if(SetPDFRectangleFromArray(....) == eFailure) do\_the\_default.

| At first glance, all these changes look fine to me. Questions:   1. Should we add more test PDF files to the repository to ensure we are resolving these NPEs completely? 2. Are these exploitable in the wild? If so, should we be handling this more discreetly, with a private pull request, or similar? 3. Will we be reporting this as a vulnerability to Snyk? |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
