Echoing invalid input to the console allows a malicious console
application to invoke an arbitrary command. We now respond to such
invalid requests with a cancel, just like xterm.

Thanks to Carter Sande of duodecima.technology for calling my
attention to this issue.

# Zutty: Arbitrary Code Execution — GLSA **202209-25**

A vulnerability has been discovered in Zutty which could allow for arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-terms/zutty** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.13** |

### Background

Zutty is an X terminal emulator rendering through OpenGL ES Compute Shaders.

### Description

Zutty does not correctly handle invalid DECRQSS commands, which can be exploited to run arbitrary commands in the terminal.

### Impact

Untrusted text written to the Zutty terminal can achieve arbitrary code execution.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Zutty users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/zutty-0.13"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Carter Sande    2022-09-04 20:32:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 803227](attachment.cgi?id=803227 "POC text file (runs \"cat /etc/passwd\" when displayed in Zutty)") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=803227&action=edit "POC text file (runs \"cat /etc/passwd\" when displayed in Zutty)")] POC text file (runs "cat /etc/passwd" when displayed in Zutty)  x11-terms/zutty contains a vulnerability which allows arbitrary commands to be run by an attacker who can cause output to be sent to the terminal. Specifically, they can include newlines in an invalid DECRQSS command and Zutty will send those newlines (along with any command included) back to the shell. This vulnerability very closely resembles CVE-2008-2383 in xterm.  I have confirmed this vulnerability exists in x11-terms/zutty-0.12 in Gentoo, and I suspect it exists in all versions since 0.2 (when the code to handle DECRQSS was added).  I have not reported this issue to upstream, as I was unable to find a private method of contact. I would appreciate any help the Gentoo Security team can provide in responsibly disclosing/fixing the issue. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-04 20:38:58 UTC  ``` Thanks.
