Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of invalid DECRQSS (Request Status String) commands within the Zutty terminal emulator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core weakness is the improper parsing of DECRQSS commands. Specifically, the terminal emulator fails to handle newlines within these commands correctly.
- Instead of discarding or sanitizing invalid input, Zutty echoes the input (including the newlines) back to the shell, making it possible to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running the Zutty terminal.
- An attacker can inject malicious commands by sending specially crafted text to the terminal, achieving full control of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the terminal input. Any text sent to the Zutty terminal could potentially contain a malicious DECRQSS command.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by untrusted text sources which are displayed in the Zutty terminal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send text to a Zutty terminal. This could be achieved through various means:
    -  Pasting text into the terminal
    -  Displaying content that the terminal renders
    -  Through a compromised application that sends output to the terminal.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges besides being able to send data to the terminal application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2008-2383, which affected the xterm terminal emulator.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) was created that can execute `cat /etc/passwd` when displayed in Zutty, showing the ability to run arbitrary commands.
- A patch has been created to fix the vulnerability by preventing the echoing of invalid DECRQSS commands containing newlines.
- The vulnerability was present since version 0.2 of Zutty, when the DECRQSS handling was implemented.
