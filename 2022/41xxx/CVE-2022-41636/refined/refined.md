- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "Ethernet Q Commands" service of the Haas Controller transmits communication traffic in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can intercept and obtain sensitive information being passed to and from the controller. This includes potential authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting the "Ethernet Q Commands" service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the controller, which includes the possibility of remote access.
