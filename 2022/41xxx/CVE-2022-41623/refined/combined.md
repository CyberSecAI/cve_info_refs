### **A. Connect AliExpress and WooCommerce store**

### **B. Import products with AliExpress Dropshipping for WooCommerce**

This plugin allows you to import products from AliExpess to your WooCommerce store:

* Import single products: The plugin allows you to import single products.
* Import category: The plugin allows you to import categories, too.

### **C. Set up imported products through AliExpress Dropshipping for WooCommerce**

You can set up global rules for products and prices, also manage AliExpress products in the **Import List,** and quickly observe in the **Imported** sections before transferring to the WooCommerce store. In addition, you can customize AliExpress products the same as other [WooCommerce products](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/).

### **+ Setup global rules:**

**a. Global rules for products:**

These rules will be applied in the Import list section before migrating into your WooCommerce store including:

* **Products Status**: Choose the status of imported products on your WooCommerce website. In particular, product status can be automatically set: Publish, Pending or Draft.
* **Product SKU:** If using the shortcode `{ali_product_id}`, the ID of the product on AliExpress will be the SKU of the product on WooCommerce.
* **Auto-generate unique SKU if exists:** When importing a product in the Import list, automatically generate a unique SKU by adding an increment if the SKU exists.
* **Use global attributes**: By default, all attributes of imported products are custom attributes. Enabling this option allows us to automatically transfer those attributes to global attributes.
* **Show shipping option:** Enable this option to display the shipping option in the Import list. Particularly, this feature will help to show the shipping cost of available shipping methods. Certainly, it will be easy for you to estimate product costs after calculating shipping costs.
* **Add shipping cost after price rules:** Shipping cost will be added to the price of the original product after applying price rules.
* **Import as a simple product:** If a product just has one variation or you select one variation to import, that product will be imported as a simple product. However, variation SKU and attributes will not be used.
* **Catalog visibility:** This setting determines which shop pages products will be listed on. In particular, it can be: Shop and search results; Shop only; Search results only; Hidden
* **Product description:** Select to display product description and/or item specifics or not show this info in the imported product.  In detail, selection can be: None; Item specifics; Product description; Item specifics & Product Description
* **Use the external link for images:** You need to install an external storage plugin named: [EXMAGE – WordPress Image Links](https://wordpress.org/plugins/exmage-wp-image-links/) plugin by VillaTheme before you can see this option. If you enable it, the original AliExpress image URL is saved on that external storage plugin, which helps to save your website storage space. This option replaces the Import description images option, which allows you to import AliExpress images to your server and eat up your website storage space.
* **Download description images:** Enable this option to allow importing images in the product description if they are available.
* **Default select product images:**Enable it, the First image will be selected as the product image, and other images (except images from the product description) will be selected in the gallery when adding the product to the import list.
* **Disable background process:**When importing products, instead of letting their images download in the background, the main product image will be downloaded directly, and gallery and variation images (if any) will be added to the Failed images pages so that you can go there to download them manually.
* **Default categories:**Fill in the category titles, so imported products will be added to these categories.
* **Default shipping class:** The shipping class selected here will also be selected by default in the Import list. If you are using [shipping class in WooCommerce](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/product-shipping-classes/), available shipping classes will show up in the shipping class field of this Products tab, so you can choose one as default and apply for all products in the Import List
* **Default product tags:**Fill in the tag titles, so imported products will be added to these tags.
* **Product variations are visible on the product page:**Enable to make variations of imported products visible on the product page.
* **Manage stock:**Enable to manage stock and import product inventory. However, if you disable this option, the product stock status will be set to “**In stock**” and product inventory will not be imported.
* **Ignore import ship from** Enable to only import product variation with the ship from China.
* **Find and Replace:**You can search for strings in the product title and description and replace found strings with respective values.

### **b. Global rules for product price:**

These rules will apply in the Import list section before migrating into your WooCommerce store.

* **Exchange rate:** This option allows you to convert US Dollars to your store currency from any amount. In addition, there are 2 ways to add the exchange rate: Click on the **Update rate** or add the exchange rate manually.  Another key point, if this field sets the value as 1, it means that there is no change in currency ($USD as default).
* **Exchange rate decimals:** Number of decimals to round the exchange rate when updating the exchange rate with API.
* **Exchange rate of CNY / USD**: In some cases, prices are only available in CNY so we first have to convert them to USD. If not set, our plugin will skip the syncing price.
* **Exchange rate of RUB/ USD**: In some cases, prices are only available in RUB so we first have to convert them to USD. If not set, you will not be able to import products in RUB(if the store currency is not RUB) and our plugin will skip syncing price.
* **Exchange rate API:** You can choose one of the available API currency exchange rate sources such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Cuex, or TransferWise.
* **Update rate automatically:**Enable this option to automatically update the exchange rate as a schedule, especially, accurately at days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

     Hi,

     As you said, I guess you misunderstand the Default categories in the plugin settings with importing aliexpress categories.

     When you choose a Default category in the plugin settings means: that category has been created on your WooCommerce and all imported products will be listed in that category.

     And in the video to imported products, you can go to the category and import a range of products instead of going to every single product to import, you can see this: <https://prnt.sc/twxgtw>

   Olá, adorei o Plugin, pelo fato dele ser disponibilizado gratuitamente. Eu vi que com a Versão Pro ele consegue ser mais Produtivo, e tenho interesse em comprar. Porém tenho uma dúvida, A versão Pro deste Plugin consegue integrar os preços do aliexpress em tempo real? Depois de estarem já no meu site? Por exemplo, se meu fornecedor aumentar os preços, ou criar uma promoção, estas atualizações vão para o meu site ecommerce automaticamente? ou este processo de atualização de preços tem que ser feito manualmente por mim? desde Já agradeço a atenção!

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
