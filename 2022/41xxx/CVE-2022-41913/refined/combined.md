# Discourse-calendar exposes members of hidden groups

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-jh96-w279-g7r9
Nov 14, 2022

## Package

discourse-calendar
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

0.2

## Patched versions

0.3

## Description

### Impact

Members of private groups or public groups with private members can be listed by users, who can create and edit post events. This vulnerability only affects sites which have discourse post events enabled.

### Patches

The latest version of the Discourse Calendar plugin has the patch.

### Workarounds

Disable the `discourse_post_event_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the issue.

Also, it's possible to prevent regular users from using this vulnerability by removing all groups from the `discourse_post_event_allowed_on_groups`. But note that moderators will still be able to use it.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
