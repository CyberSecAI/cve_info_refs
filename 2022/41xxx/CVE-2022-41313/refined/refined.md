Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Contact Information" field of the Moxa SDS-3008 Series Industrial Ethernet Switch web application. Specifically, the application does not neutralize or encode user-supplied input before using it in the generation of a web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the "Contact Information" field. The injected code gets stored in the application's database/configuration and is executed in the browsers of other users who view this information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when viewing the vulnerable page. This can lead to various impacts:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing session tokens and gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - **Displaying false information:** Manipulating the displayed content to deceive users.
    - **Denial of service:** Clearing other user's cookies and denying access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the web application containing malicious JavaScript code in the "Contact Information" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges (likely administrator/configuration rights) to modify the "Contact Information" field in the device's web application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the Moxa SDS-3008 switch.

**Technical Details**
The "Contact Information" field, identified by the name attribute `switch_contact`, is embedded within `<script>` tags in the HTML, making it vulnerable to XSS injection by manipulating the value attribute of the form field.

```html
<script>document.switch_information_form.switch_contact.value="";</script>
```

By injecting the following payload, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in other user's browsers:
```
";alert('XSS');//
```
