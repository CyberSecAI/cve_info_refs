{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `tf.raw_ops.DynamicStitch` operation in TensorFlow did not properly validate the number of input tensors, leading to an out-of-bounds access when the number of `indices` and `data` inputs did not match.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing input validation in `DynamicStitch` operation.",
    "Out-of-bounds memory access."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A crash (segmentation fault) due to out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a differing number of input tensors for `indices` and `data` to the `tf.raw_ops.DynamicStitch` operation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.DynamicStitch` operation. This could involve crafting a specific TensorFlow graph or manipulating input data."
