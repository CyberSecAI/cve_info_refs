Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of U3D files within PDF-XChange Editor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to crafted data within a U3D file. This crafted data can cause the software to write past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running PDF-XChange Editor. This could potentially lead to complete system compromise depending on the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious U3D file, which could be delivered to the target in a number of ways.
- The user must interact with the malicious file or page which is the trigger. This requires either opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious web page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious U3D file with specific data to trigger the vulnerability. They must also be able to get the victim to open this file using PDF-XChange Editor.

**Additional Information**
- PDF-XChange has released an update to address this vulnerability.
