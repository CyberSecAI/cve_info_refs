Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload functionality in the `update_profile.php` file of the Online Tours & Travels Management System. The system allows users to upload files, and it does not perform sufficient validation or sanitization of the uploaded files. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without proper checks on file type or content. This is a classic vulnerability that opens the door for various attacks, including remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The application does not validate the file extension or MIME type of the uploaded file. As a result, an attacker can upload a PHP file disguised with another extension or no extension and still get it processed by the PHP engine.
*   **Lack of Sanitization/Filtering:** The uploaded file's content is not sanitized or filtered, which means that if a user uploads a PHP file with malicious code, this code will be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the server and its data.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
    *   Installation of backdoors for persistent access.
    *   Further attacks against other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload Form:** The attacker uses the `profile.php?id=1` endpoint which presents a form with file upload capabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account. The content mentions a super admin account, but it's not clear if a lower privileged account can also perform the attack.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server to make HTTP requests and upload files.

**Technical Details:**
The provided content includes a sample HTTP request that can be used to exploit the vulnerability, showing the multipart/form-data and the malicious PHP file content:
