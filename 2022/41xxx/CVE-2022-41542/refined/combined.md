Session Misconfiguration is widely popular vulnerability.

Vulnerability Category: **A5-Broken Access Control**

Vulnerability Description: The application does not properly invalidate a user’s session on the server after the user initiates logout. User sessions remain active on the server, and any requests submitted including the user’s session identifier will execute successfully, as though the user had made those requests.

Impact: An attacker can use previous used or available session token to login into application.

Recommendation: The user’s HTTP session should be terminated on the server immediately after a logout action is performed. It is important to note that simply deleting the cookie from the browser will not terminate the server session. The session must be invalidated at the server, using the HTTP container’s intrinsic session abandonment mechanism.

Severity : Low

CVSS v3.0 Score: 3.8
