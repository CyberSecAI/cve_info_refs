The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41778.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data without proper verification within the Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master software. This occurs via the "Device-DataCollect" service port.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The application deserializes user-supplied data without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- This is due to the ability to provide malicious serialized objects that are then deserialized and executed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends malicious serialized objects to the "Device-DataCollect" service port.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the "Device-DataCollect" service port.
- No authentication is required.
- Low attack complexity.
