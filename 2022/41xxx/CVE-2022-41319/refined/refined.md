- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79). The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing arbitrary web script injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject arbitrary web script into the HTTP parameter of the login page, which could lead to malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP request to the login page, specifically the `https://{Host}/DLOServer/restore/login.jsp` endpoint. The attacker injects malicious script within a parameter of the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected login page. No authentication is required.
