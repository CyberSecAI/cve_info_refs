Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-41237:

**CVE-2022-41237**

*   **Root Cause:** The DotCi Plugin does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
*   **Weakness:**  Improper deserialization of YAML input. This allows for the instantiation of arbitrary Java objects, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can modify `.ci.yml` files in the source code management (SCM) system. When Jenkins processes this modified file, the malicious YAML payload is parsed, leading to RCE.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to modify `.ci.yml` files within the SCM used by Jenkins. They also need Overall/Read permissions.
