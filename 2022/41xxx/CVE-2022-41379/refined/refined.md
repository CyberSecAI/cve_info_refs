The provided content describes an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Online Leave Management System v1.0, which allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper file type validation and sanitization during the user profile picture upload process in the "User list" module of the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file upload: The system allows uploading files of any type, including PHP scripts.
- Lack of input validation: There are no checks to ensure that the uploaded file is actually an image.
- Unrestricted file upload location: Uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible directory (`leave_system\uploads`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can upload a malicious PHP script containing arbitrary code, and then execute it by accessing the file through the web browser.
- Full server compromise: By uploading a webshell, the attacker can potentially gain full control over the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/leave_system/classes/Users.php?f=save` endpoint.
- Sending a `multipart/form-data` request with a crafted filename (e.g., `shell.php`) and malicious PHP code within the file content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the admin panel of the Online Leave Management System (credentials: `admin/admin123`).
- Ability to create a new user or edit an existing user, which triggers the file upload functionality.
