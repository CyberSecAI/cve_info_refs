- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The KardiaMobile IoT device uses unencrypted data-over-sound protocols for communication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing encryption of sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read patient EKG results or create a denial-of-service condition by emitting sounds at similar frequencies as the device, disrupting the smartphone microphone's ability to accurately read the data.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the unencrypted data-over-sound communication of the KardiaMobile IoT device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be close (less than 5 feet) to the device to pick up and emit sound waves.
