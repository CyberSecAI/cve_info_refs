  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Optinly plugin, in versions <= 1.0.15, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This allows an attacker to force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions while authenticated.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site that would then make a request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to perform an action that the attacker controls and that the plugin does not protect against."
