Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `update_booking.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially bypass authentication (as shown with the provided super admin login)
*   Data breach: An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
*   System compromise: In some scenarios, SQL injection can be used to gain control of the database server or the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious GET request to `update_booking.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The `id` parameter is injected with SQL code through the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** An attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious payload.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Although the description mentions a super admin login, the SQLi is independent of login.
