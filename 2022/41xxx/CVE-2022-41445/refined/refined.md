Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when adding subjects in the "Teachers Record Management System" which is built using CodeIgniter. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the subject name before storing and displaying it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to persistent or stored XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens, which can lead to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing web pages.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Attacker Access:** The attacker needs to have an admin account in the "Teachers Record Management System" to add a subject.
2.  **Payload Injection:** The attacker navigates to the 'Add Subject' page and inputs a malicious javascript payload in the "subject name" field.
3.  **Payload Storage:** Once submitted, the malicious payload is stored within the system's database.
4.  **Payload Execution:** When a teacher logs in and views their profile, the injected Javascript payload stored in the subject field is executed within the teacher's browser. This occurs when the profile view displays the subjects associated with the teacher which includes the injected malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid admin-level account on the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim; the attack can be performed remotely.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerable software is the "Teachers Record Management System" version 1.0, developed using CodeIgniter, by PHPGurukul.
- The vulnerability is located within the source code of the application, and the affected component is the subject adding feature.
- The vulnerability was discovered by RashidKhan Pathan.
