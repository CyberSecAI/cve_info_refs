  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates where parameters are inserted into a stack buffer using `sprintf` without checking the size of the input parameters, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",

      "CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’)"
