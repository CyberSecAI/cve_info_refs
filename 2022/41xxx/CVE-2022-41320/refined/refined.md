- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Veritas System Recovery (VSR) versions 18 and 21 store network destination passwords in the Windows registry during backup configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information disclosure due to storing network destination passwords in the Windows registry in plaintext or an easily reversible format.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A Windows user with sufficient privileges to access the registry can obtain the network destination password, allowing unauthorized access to the network file system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the Windows system where VSR is installed and the registry is accessible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a Windows user with sufficient privileges to access the Windows registry.
