SSA-120378: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Teamcenter
Visualization and JT2Go

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2022-11-08
2023-06-13
V1.2

SUMMARY

Siemens Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go are affected by multiple ﬁle parsing vulnerabilities that
could be triggered when the application reads malicious TIF, CGM or PDF ﬁles. If a user is tricked to
open a malicious TIF, CGM or PDF ﬁle with the affected products, this could lead the application to crash
or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT,
VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-39136

The affected application is vulnerable to ﬁxed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted
TIF ﬁles. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
process.
