- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap overflow, out-of-bounds read, null pointer, or other issues in the fingerprint Trusted Application (TA).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerabilities in the fingerprint TA, including potential heap overflows, out-of-bounds reads, or null pointer dereferences.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with root permission can control the file content and exploit these vulnerabilities. This could lead to abnormal fingerprint service behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation involves an attacker with root privileges modifying file content used by the fingerprint TA.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have root privileges on the device and be able to modify files that influence the fingerprint TA.
