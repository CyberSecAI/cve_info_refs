The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41472.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the 74cmsSE bulletin creation functionality. The application fails to properly filter user-provided input before storing it in the database, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Inadequate input sanitization. The application only escapes angle brackets, failing to prevent XSS payloads that use other characters or techniques.
- Lack of proper output encoding on retrieval

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the bulletin title.
- When a user views the bulletin, the attacker's script will execute in the user's browser.
- This can be used for various malicious activities, including session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing sensitive information, and more.
- The impact is significant because the injected script is stored and will be triggered every time a user views the compromised bulletin.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the bulletin creation functionality in the 74cmsSE admin interface.
- An attacker can inject the XSS payload into the title of the bulletin.
- The attack is stored; it is not a reflection of the input but rather is persisted to the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the 74cmsSE instance to create bulletins.
- They need to be able to access the background interface to create new bulletin, and then inject the XSS payload in the title field during the creation process.
- Knowledge of AngularJS sandbox escapes is needed to craft a working payload, specifically the use of `{{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in 74cmsSE v3.12.0.
- The XSS payload `{{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}` exploits an AngularJS sandbox escape.
- The vulnerable code is located in `\74cmsSEv3.12.0\upload\application\apiadmin\controller\Notice.php`.
- The application filters only angle brackets `<` and `>`, allowing bypass with the given payload, which does not contain these symbols.
