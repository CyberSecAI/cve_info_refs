**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Avada theme for WordPress versions 7.8.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF:** The theme lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions the theme allows and the privileges of the user being targeted.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. This could be through a crafted email, forum post, or other method where the attacker can get the user to initiate the request unknowingly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user to perform an action that triggers the CSRF vulnerability. The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated.
* The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system.
