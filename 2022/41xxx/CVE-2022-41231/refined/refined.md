**CVE-2022-41231**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The build-publisher plugin allows attackers to manipulate `config.xml` files via a crafted file name provided to an API endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Path traversal: The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the file path, allowing an attacker to create or overwrite files outside the intended directory.
    *   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): The vulnerable endpoint does not require POST requests, enabling CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with Item/Configure permission can create or replace any `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller file system, potentially leading to privilege escalation or denial of service.
    *   CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to replace any `config.xml` file with an empty file.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Network access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   Crafted file name sent to the vulnerable API endpoint.
    *   For CSRF, the attacker would need to trick a user with Item/Configure permissions into visiting a malicious site.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Item/Configure permission on the Jenkins instance is required to exploit the path traversal vulnerability.
    *   Overall/Read permission would be needed to trick a user into visiting a malicious site for CSRF attack
