The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41884.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the return value of `PyArray_SimpleNewFromData` when creating a NumPy array from a tensor in TensorFlow. This function can return `null` for specific shapes. Specifically, shapes with a zero dimension and other dimensions which when multiplied result in a large number. The return value was not being checked, leading to a segmentation fault when the returned `null` value was used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing null check on the return value of `PyArray_SimpleNewFromData`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A segmentation fault (segfault) can occur, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Creating a NumPy array with a shape that results in the `PyArray_SimpleNewFromData` function returning `null`. This is achievable by crafting an input shape with a zero dimension and large values in other dimensions such that the product of the non-zero dimensions is a very large number.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the shape of tensors that are converted to numpy arrays.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs within the `ndarray_tensor_bridge` of TensorFlow.
- The fix involves adding a check for the `null` return value of `PyArray_SimpleNewFromData` and raising an `InvalidArgumentError` exception if it occurs along with the error message from numpy.
- The vulnerability is addressed in TensorFlow versions 2.8.4, 2.9.3, 2.10.1, and 2.11.0.
- A proof of concept is given, that uses `tf.broadcast_to` with an input and a crafted shape, triggering the vulnerability.
