The provided content describes a vulnerability, but it does not relate to CVE-2022-41432. The content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in EyesOfNetwork web interface version 5.3. The text also lists the affected component as `/module/report_event/index.php` and states the vulnerable parameter is a GET parameter type. The issue is further referenced as being reported on GitHub Issues.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- The vulnerability is caused by the web interface not sanitizing user-supplied input in the GET parameter at `/module/report_event/index.php`, which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, allowing them to perform actions such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, or redirecting to malicious sites.

Attack vectors:
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in the GET parameter, specifically on the `/module/report_event/index.php` endpoint.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious link containing the JavaScript payload and entice the victim into clicking on the link.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated; the vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted link.
