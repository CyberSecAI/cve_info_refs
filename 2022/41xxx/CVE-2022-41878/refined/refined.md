- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Keywords specified in the `requestKeywordDenylist` option can be injected via Cloud Code Webhooks or Triggers, bypassing the intended denylist.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Prototype pollution through injection of denylisted keywords.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Injected keywords are saved to the database, bypassing the `requestKeywordDenylist`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or potential security risks, although the specific consequences are not elaborated in this description.
- **Attack vectors**: Cloud Code Webhooks or Cloud Code Triggers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to trigger Cloud Code Webhooks or Triggers with malicious input. The required privileges are high. The attack vector is network based.
