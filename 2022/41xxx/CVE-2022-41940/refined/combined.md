Before this change, receiving an HTTP2 upgrade would make the server
crash:

> Error: read ECONNRESET
>    at TCP.onStreamRead (node:internal/stream_base_commons:217:20) {
>  errno: -104,
>  code: 'ECONNRESET',
>  syscall: 'read'
> }

This can be reproduced with Node.js v14.15.3, v16.18.1 and v18.12.1.

([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

## Description

### Impact

A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process.

```
events.js:292
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: read ECONNRESET
    at TCP.onStreamRead (internal/stream_base_commons.js:209:20)
Emitted 'error' event on Socket instance at:
    at emitErrorNT (internal/streams/destroy.js:106:8)
    at emitErrorCloseNT (internal/streams/destroy.js:74:3)
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:80:21) {
  errno: -104,
  code: 'ECONNRESET',
  syscall: 'read'
}

```

This impacts all the users of the [`engine.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/engine.io) package, including those who uses depending packages like [`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io).
