- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An uncontrolled search path in some Intel Network Adapter installer software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled search path vulnerability. This means that the software might load and execute code from an attacker-controlled location, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privilege, allowing an attacker to gain higher privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. An authenticated user needs local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user with local access and the ability to manipulate the search path. User interaction is also required (UI:R), suggesting that the attacker needs to trick the user into performing an action.
