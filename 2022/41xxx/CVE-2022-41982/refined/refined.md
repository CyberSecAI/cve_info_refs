- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software doesn't properly control the search paths used when loading libraries or executables. This can lead to the software loading malicious files if a user places them in a location where the software searches.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privilege. An attacker can potentially gain higher privileges on the system by placing malicious files in a location where the software searches.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user with local access to the system and the ability to place files in a location that is part of the software's search path. User interaction is also required.
