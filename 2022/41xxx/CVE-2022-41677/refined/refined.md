- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control allows unauthenticated access to sensitive device information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient access controls on certain commands allow retrieval of device capabilities and network settings without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve device information, including capabilities and network settings. This could expose internal network configurations if the device is connected to the internet.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Bosch IP camera, and no authentication is required.
