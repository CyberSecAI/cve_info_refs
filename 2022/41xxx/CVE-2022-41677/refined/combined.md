## Solution and Mitigations

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the affected Bosch firmware to a fixed version. The fixed version will increase required access rights for several commands. If an update is not possible in timely manner, users are recommended to follow the mitigations and workarounds described in the following section.

A reboot of the camera is required after uploading the update.

The version of the firmware should be checked after the update to confirm successful installation e.g. in the web based interface (Service - System Overview)

### Firewalling

Disallowing connections from insecure networks to the camera by means of a firewall prevents the attacker from accessing the information.

### IP Filtering

The camera has the possibility to whitelist networks or IP addresses to only allow access from trusted networks or IPs, preventing an attacker from accessing the information.
