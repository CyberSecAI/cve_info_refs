  Interface settings

## Installation

#### Automatic Installation

Go to WordPress dashboard, click Plugins / Add New , type ‘woocommerce phone orders’ and hit Enter.

Install and activate plugin, visit WooCommerce > Phone Orders.

#### Manual Installation

[Please, visit the link and follow the instructions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)

## FAQ

### Can many operators use same account to add orders?

It’s not recommended, as WooCommerce remembers customer details and cart contents in active session.

Please, use [free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loggedin/) to prevent this situation.

### How to set default country/state for new customers

[Pro version](https://algolplus.com/plugins/downloads/phone-orders-woocommerce-pro/?currency=USD) has more settings and we keep adding them.

### I can’t add new customer, I see the message “Please enter an account password”

Please, visit >WooCommerce>Settings, select tab “Accounts & Privacy” and mark checkbox “When creating an account, automatically generate an account password”.

### I can’t add new customer, I see the message “Please enter a valid account username”

Please, visit >WooCommerce>Settings, select tab “Accounts & Privacy” and mark checkbox “When creating an account, automatically generate a username from the customer’s email address”.

### I don’t see Free Shipping [Phone Orders] in popup

Please, visit >WooCommerce>Settings>Shipping and add shipping method for necessary zones

### I enabled “Cash on delivery”, but I don’t see it in payment methods

You should add non-virtual product to the cart at first. If you want to hide this method at frontend – [use this code](https://gist.github.com/alexv66/82d623841d33dc3f6abb1fd98873d710)

### How to pay order?

[Pro version](https://algolplus.com/plugins/downloads/phone-orders-woocommerce-pro/?currency=USD) allows you to pay as customer, via checkout page.

You can pay directly from admin area too – use [this free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-mp/). They support Stripe and Authorize.Net.

### How to apply bulk/roles/others discounts?

Use our free [discount plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-dynamic-pricing-for-woocommerce/) to configure necessary pricing rules.

### My pricing plugin doesn’t apply role-based discount

Please, mark checkbox “Switch customer during cart calculations” at tab Settings.

### Button “Create Order” does nothing

Probably, there is a conflict with another plugin. [Please, check javascript errors at first](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/#step-3-diagnosis)

### New phone order does not change the stock

WooCommerce reduces stock only for orders having following statuses – Completed, Processing, On hold

### Shipping cost is not added to Order Total

Please, visit >WooCommerce>Settings>Shipping>Shipping Options and turn off “Hide shipping costs until an address is entered”

Excellent plugin with fast and helpful support.
If you are still using the built-in WooCommerce order creation and editing tools, you need to get this plugin.

I was looking for this for a long time.
If you want to take an order over the phone, without all the hassle of trying to keep your inventory in synch, this is the one for you.
Lets you create an order, send it over to your customer, and have them pay for it in a couple of clicks. Love it.

The default admin order feature leaves a lot to be desired. We have a very complicated store with custom shipping packaging for items that ship from multiple warehouses and woocommerce dynamic pricing, the default admin ordering doesn’t do anything of that but this one does it all (I tested the free version and I’m recommending the pro version for the pause and restart option and pay as customer.
The free plugin reculculated the dyanamic pricing and correctly used the custom shipping packaging and rules. I’m very impressed. The only part of the plugin that could be imporoved for us is that we use variations with multiple selectors and when we search for a product it only shows us the product name for each variation and doesn’t show the variation options (so it’s difficult to know which one we need to select). I’m not sure yet if the pro version fixes that, but if not, we’ll make a feature request.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
