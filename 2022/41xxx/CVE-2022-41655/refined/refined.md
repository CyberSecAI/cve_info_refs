Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Phone Orders for WooCommerce plugin. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functionalities, allowing unauthorized users to perform privileged actions. This is a classic broken access control vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (such as a subscriber) could potentially perform actions intended for administrators or other higher-level users. The exact impact will vary depending on the specific actions that are vulnerable to this issue.  Without knowing what exact function is vulnerable, the impact cannot be determined with certainty, but could include modification of orders or accessing sensitive customer data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by directly accessing the vulnerable function in the plugin. The missing checks allow bypassing the normal access control mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on the affected WordPress site, with at least a subscriber role. No other special capabilities or network position are stated, but it is implied the attacker has to be able to send requests to the WordPress instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions 3.7.1 and earlier of the Phone Orders for WooCommerce plugin.
- It was fixed in version 3.7.2.
- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the vulnerability until the plugin is updated.
- The CVE description references "Sensitive Data Exposure" which is likely a symptom of a wider broken access control vulnerability.
