- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability while parsing a CGM file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The software does not properly validate the boundaries of data being read from a CGM file, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted CGM file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious CGM file. User interaction is required.
