How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Description

[Media Library Folders for WordPress](https://www.maxgalleria.com/downloads/media-library-plus-pro/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=mlfp&utm_content=first&utm_campaign=firstword) creates actual folders in your WordPress Media Library:

* Actual folders make it easier to [organize your WordPress media library](https://maxgalleria.com/organized-wordpress-media-library-folders/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=mlfp&utm_content=organize&utm_campaign=organize) while reducing server burden.
* [Add and build new Media library folders](https://maxgalleria.com/add-organize-media-library-folders/) to label and organize as you wish instead of just month/date.
* [Move, copy, rename and delete files and folders](https://maxgalleria.com/wordpress-media-folders-move-rename-delete-folders/) with a nice drag and drop interface
* Regenerate thumbnails.
* SEO Images to specify ALT and TITLE attributes when uploading.
* Sync folders/files when moving or uploading a folder via FTP.
* Create a [MaxGalleria](https://maxgalleria.com/) gallery.
* Block direct access for selected media library files

MLF adds to and works with the functionality of WordPress Media Library. It does not replace it.

> **Just what I was looking for!** I use this on ALL my WordPress sites. I don’t know why you wouldn’t. It not only allows you to organize your image files in your WP site, but it also creates logical URL links to your files based on the folders you create and the name of the image file. So great! No more random numbers for image URL’s.
>
> **Great for organization and better media!** WordPress’s default media folders didn’t work for us on a project with strict requirements on organizing their uploaded files. We had trouble finding a low-impact solution that fulfilled all requirements.
>
> Media Library Plus solved all our issues, and we’ve been using it on a major site with 11 custom post types, hundreds of media files, and tons of other plugins/customizations — zero issues and exactly what we need!
>
> MLP performs beautifully and provides great media management features and functionality! To make matters even better support is extremely fast and responsive to inquiries. Great stuff!

**Block Direct Access**

> Media Library Folders now includes Block Direct Access, our pro version feature that prevents unauthorized downloads of proprietary media files:
>
> \* Protect unlimited media files
>
> \* Customized no access page
>
> \* Block Google Search from indexing your media files
>
> \* Prevent file hotlinking
>
> \* Restrict media library access
>
> \* Disable copy and right click
>
> \* Generate and limit private URLs
>
> \* Restrict access to private URLs by IP Address

When you click on Media Library Folders for WordPress it displays the contents of the uploads folder where you will see the level folders such as ‘2016’, ‘2015’.

We assume your site has the WordPress Media Library setting option ‘Organize my uploads into month- and year-based folders’ selected. To view the contents of a folder, click on the folder image. To navigate up in the folder structure click on the links in the Location: breadcrumb string.

Clicking an image will take you to the image attachment details page. If you close that page when you are done you will be in the old media library. Instead click your browser’s go back button twice and you will be taken back to the folder page.

We also have an article on [How to Sync your WordPress Media Library with FTP Folders](https://maxgalleria.com/sync-wordpress-media-library-ftp-folders/) if you have a large number of images.

## FAQ

### Folder Tree Not Loading

Users who report this issue can usually fix it by running the Media Library Folders Reset plugin that comes with Media Library Folders.

1. First make sure you have installed the latest version of Media Library Folders.
2. Deactivate Media Library Folders and activate Media Library Folders Reset and run the Reset Database option from the Media Library Folders Reset sub menu in the dashboard.
3. After that, reactivate Media Library Folders. It will do a fresh scan of your media library database and no changes will be made to the files or folders on your site.

### How to Unhide a Hidden Folder

1. Go to the hidden folder via your cPanel or FTP and remove the file ‘mlpp-hidden’.
2. In the Media Library Folders Menu, click the Check for New folders link. This will add the folder back into Media Library Folders
3. Visit the unhidden folder in Media Library Folders and click the Sync button to add contents of the folder. Before doing this, check to see that there are no thumbnail images in the current folder since these will be regenerated automatically; these usually have file names such as image-name-150×150.jpg, etc.
4. Repeat step 3 for each sub folder.

### Folders and images added to the site by FTP are not showing up in Media Library Folders

Media Library Folders does not work like the file manager on your computer. It only display images and folders that have been added to the Media Library database. To display new folders that have not been added through the Media Library Folders you can click the Check for new folders option in the Media Library Folders submenu in the WordPress Dashboard. If you allow WordPress to store images by year and month folders, then you should click the option once each month to add these auto-generated folders.

To add images that were upload to the site via the cPanel or by FTP, navigate to the folder containing the images in Media Library Folders and click the Sync button. This will scan the folder looking images not currently found in the Media Library for that folder. The Sync function only scans the current folder. If there are subfolders, you will need to individually sync them.

### Folders Loads Indefinitely

This happens when a parent folder is missing from the folder data. To fix this you will need to perform a reset of the Media Library Folders database. To do this, deactivate Media Library Folders and activate Media Library Folders Reset and select the Reset Database option. Once the reset has completed, reactivate Media Library Folders and it will do a fresh scan of the Media Library data.

### Unable to Insert files from Media Library Folders into Posts or Pages

For inserting images and files into posts and pages you will have to use the existing Media Library. The ability to insert items from the Media Library Folders user interface is only available in [Media Library Folders Pro](https://www.maxgalleria.com/downloads/media-library-plus-pro/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=mlfp&utm_content=mlpp&utm_campaign=repo). This does not mean you cannot insert files added to Media Library Folders into any WordPress posts or pages. Media Library Folders adds a folder user interface and file operations to the existing media library and it does not add a second media library. Since all the images are in the same media library there is no obstacle to inserting them anywhere WordPress allows media files to be inserted. There is just no folder tree available in the media library insert window for locating images in a particular folder. We chose to include the folder tree for inserting images in posts and page in the Pro version along with other features in order to fund the cost of providing free technical support and continued development of the plugin.

### Unable to Update Media Library Folders Reset

Media Library Folders Reset is maintenance and diagnostic plugin that is included with Media Library Folders. It automatically updates when Media Library Folders is updated. There is no need to updated it separately. Users should leave the reset plugin deactivated until it is needed in order to avoid accidentally deleting your site’s folder data.

### Images Not Found After Changing the Location of Uploads Folder

If you change the location of the uploads folder, your existing files and images will not be moved to the new location. You will need to delete them from media library and upload them again. Also you will need to perform a reset of the Media Library Folders database. To do this, deactivate Media Library Folders and activate Media Library Folders Reset and select the Reset Database option. Once the reset has completed, reactivate Media Library Folders and it will do a fresh scan of the Media Library data.

### Difficulties Uploading or Dragging and Dropping a Large Number of Files

Limitations on web server processing time may cause dragging and dropping a large number of files to fail. An error is generated when it takes to longer then 30 seconds to move, copy or upload files. This time limitation can be increased by changing the max\_execution\_time setting in your site’s php.ini file.

### How to Delete a Folder?

To delete a folder, right click (Ctrl-click with Macs) on a folder. A popup menu will appear with the options, ‘Delete this folder?’ and ‘Hide this folder?’. Click the delete option.

### Fatal error: Maximum execution time exceeded

The Maximum execution time error takes place when moving, syncing or uploading too many files at one time. The web site’s server has a setting for how long it can be busy with a task. Depending on your server, size of files and the transmission speed of your internet, you may need to reduce the number of files you upload or move at one time.

It is possible to change the maximum execution time either with a plugin such as WP Maximum Execution Time Exceeded or by editing your site’s .htaccess file and adding this line:

php\_value max\_execution\_time 300

Which will raise the maximum execution time to five minutes.

### How to Upload Multiple Files

Users can upload multiple files by using drag and drop. When the Add Files button is click it revels the file upload area either single or multiple files can be highlight can be dragged from you computer’s file manager and dropped into the file uploads areas.

### Cannot Rename or Move a Folder

Because most images and files in the media library have corresponding links embedded in site’s posts and pages, Media Library Folders does not allow folders to be rename or moved in order to prevent breaking these links. Rather, to rename or move a folder, one needs to create a new folder and move the files from the old folder to the new. During the move process, Media Library Folders will scan the sites standard posts and pages for any links matching the old address of the images or files and update them to the new address.

It seemed good at first glance; creating folders is easy and moving existing files to them is a snap. The help video isn’t great, but I didn’t really need it to get that far.
However, I cannot tell if it works like i need it to (I have a lot of media files to organize and wanted to be able to search for them by some sort of organization in stead of year/month as I make pages with them) because the functionality of actually using the folders you created for organizational purposes (like, say, in Page Builder or anywhere else outside of the plugin) is locked behind the Pro version, so I’m going to uninstall it- I don’t really want to buy anything essentially sight unseen.

Difficult to show folders and synch. When uploading photo very often it crashes with an error “0” and I need to upload 1 photo at time… really really painful. User experience really bad with a feeling of not working well to upload photos.

A fantastic plugin that I have been using for probably a year now and it just works. It replaces the URL to the folders and has no performance issues [doing that] at all. It’s seamless and is very easy to use.
Thank you @maxfoundry for this great plugin!

Ever since coming upon this handy little plugin I sticked to it throughout all of my projects. It’s one of those few plugins I consider to be a must have!Compared to other products available on the market Media Library Folders brings the most useful features even in the basic version and allows for a clean structure of your media files all the while being easy to use.Developing is an ongoing process. If you should ever face an issue and expect this plugin to be the reason, be sure that their support will take care of you asap- no matter if you’re a paying subscriber or free user.Thanks to the whole team behind! I have always had only the best experiences with them girls ‘n guys and it’s always been a pleasure.
