This PR takes the embargoed release tag `v2.39.1.windows.1` and merges it into the `main` branch.

It likely that I messed something up in the order of releasing the security release and merging the [security advisory](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-v4px-mx59-w99c).

Sorry, something went wrong.

but CMake is not told of this default. Commit 635b6d99b3 (vcbuild: install
ARM64 dependencies when building ARM64 binaries, 2020-01-31) later updated
vcpkg_install.bat to accept an arch (%1) parameter, but retained the default.

This default is neccessary for the use case where the project directory is
opened directly in Visual Studio, which will find and build a CMakeLists.txt
file without any parameters, thus expecting use of the default setting.

Also Visual studio will generate internal .sln solution and .vcxproj project
files needed for some extension tools. Inform users of the additional
.sln/.vcxproj generation.

`[fsmonitor: reintroduce core.useBuiltinFSMonitor](/git-for-windows/git/pull/4219/commits/31f219515ae9ef5e3f3e32cd7c6a054de67bb58b "fsmonitor: reintroduce core.useBuiltinFSMonitor

Reintroduce the 'core.useBuiltinFSMonitor' config setting (originally added
in 0a756b2a25 (fsmonitor: config settings are repository-specific,
2021-03-05)) after its removal from the upstream version of FSMonitor.

Upstream, the 'core.useBuiltinFSMonitor' setting was rendered obsolete by
\"overloading\" the 'core.fsmonitor' setting to take a boolean value. However,
several applications (e.g., 'scalar') utilize the original config setting,
so it should be preserved for a deprecation period before complete removal:

* if 'core.fsmonitor' is a boolean, the user is correctly using the new
  config syntax; do not use 'core.useBuiltinFSMonitor'.
* if 'core.fsmonitor' is unspecified, use 'core.useBuiltinFSMonitor'.
* if 'core.fsmonitor' is a path, override and use the builtin FSMonitor if
  'core.useBuiltinFSMonitor' is 'true'; otherwise, use the FSMonitor hook
  indicated by the path.

Additionally, for this deprecation period, advise users to switch to using
'core.fsmonitor' to specify their use of the builtin FSMonitor.

in the hasb bang line when installing scripts via `pip`).

Let's increase it to what is probably the maximum sensible path size:
MAX_PATH. This makes `parse_interpreter()` in line with what

In Git for Windows, `has_symlinks` is set to 0 by default. Therefore, we
need to parse the config setting `core.symlinks` to know if it has been

In Git for Windows, `has_symlinks` is set to 0 by default. Therefore, we
need to parse the config setting `core.symlinks` to know if it has been
set to `true`. In `git init`, we must do that before copying the
templates because they might contain symbolic links.

On LLP64 systems, such as Windows, the size of `long`, `int`, etc. is
only 32 bits (for backward compatibility). Git's use of `unsigned long`
for file memory sizes in many places, rather than size_t, limits the
handling of large files on LLP64 systems (commonly given as `>4GB`).

Provide a minimum test for handling a >4GB file. The `hash-object`
command, with the  `--literally` and without `-w` option avoids
writing the object, either loose or packed. This avoids the code paths
hitting the `bigFileThreshold` config test code, the zlib code, and the
pack code.

The previous commit adds a test that demonstrates a problem in the
`hash-object --literally` command, manifesting in an unnecessary file
size limit on systems using the LLP64 data model (which includes
Windows).

Walking the affected code path is `cmd_hash_object()` >> `hash_fd()` >>
`hash_literally()` >> `hash_object_file_literally()`.

The function `hash_object_file_literally()` is the first with a file
length parameter (via a mem buffer). This commit changes the type of
that parameter to the LLP64 compatible `size_t` type.

There are no other uses of the function. The `strbuf` type is already
`size_t` compatible.

Note: The hash-object test does not yet pass. Subsequent commits will
continue to walk the call tree's lower level functions to identify
further fixes.

Continue walking the code path for the >4GB `hash-object --literally`
test to the hash algorithm step for LLP64 systems.

This patch lets the SHA1DC code use `size_t`, making it compatible with
LLP64 data models (as used e.g. by Windows).

The interested reader of this patch will note that we adjust the
signature of the `git_SHA1DCUpdate()` function without updating _any_
call site. This certainly puzzled at least one reviewer already, so here
is an explanation:

This function is never called directly, but always via the macro
`platform_SHA1_Update`, which is usually called via the macro
`git_SHA1_Update`. However, we never call `git_SHA1_Update()` directly
in `struct git_hash_algo`. Instead, we call `git_hash_sha1_update()`,
which is defined thusly:

    static void git_hash_sha1_update(git_hash_ctx *ctx,
                                     const void *data, size_t len)
    {
        git_SHA1_Update(&ctx->sha1, data, len);
    }

i.e. it contains an implicit downcast from `size_t` to `unsigned long`
(before this here patch). With this patch, there is no downcast anymore.

With this patch, finally, the t1007-hash-object.sh \"files over 4GB hash

`[mingw: kill child processes in a gentler way](/git-for-windows/git/pull/4219/commits/7f006f116b17bd6377137d3aa03dd2e7b5051db9 "mingw: kill child processes in a gentler way

The TerminateProcess() function does not actually leave the child
processes any chance to perform any cleanup operations. This is bad
insofar as Git itself expects its signal handlers to run.

A symptom is e.g. a left-behind .lock file that would not be left behind
if the same operation was run, say, on Linux.

To remedy this situation, we use an obscure trick: we inject a thread
into the process that needs to be killed and to let that thread run the
ExitProcess() function with the desired exit status. Thanks J Wyman for
describing this trick.

The advantage is that the ExitProcess() function lets the atexit
handlers run. While this is still different from what Git expects (i.e.
running a signal handler), in practice Git sets up signal handlers and
atexit handlers that call the same code to clean up after itself.

In case that the gentle method to terminate the process failed, we still
fall back to calling TerminateProcess(), but in that case we now also
make sure that processes spawned by the spawned process are terminated;
TerminateProcess() does not give the spawned process a chance to do so
itself.

Please note that this change only affects how Git for Windows tries to
terminate processes spawned by Git's own executables. Third-party
software that *calls* Git and wants to terminate it *still* need to make
sure to imitate this gentle method, otherwise this patch will not have
any effect.

Sadly, Git's test suite still relies on a Perl interpreter even if

This canonicalization may change the length of the string (e.g. getting rid of \.\),
which breaks callers that pass the template string in a strbuf and expect the

In my particular case, the tmp-objdir code is passing a strbuf to mkdtemp and is

This topic branch re-adds the deprecated --stdin/-z options to `git

the upstream Git project before we could propose `--stdin`.

pass lots of pathspecs to Git, and these applications will need to be

This looks good to me. The CI failures seem to be either transient (the VS build) or a known issue (`linux-musl`).

Sorry, something went wrong.

## Description

### Impact

Git GUI is a convenient graphical tool that comes with Git for Windows. Its target audience are users who are uncomfortable with using Git on the command-line.

Git GUI has a function to clone repositories. Immediately after the local clone is available, Git GUI will automatically post-process it, among other things running a spell checker called `aspell.exe` if it was found.

Git GUI is implemented as a Tcl/Tk script. Due to [the unfortunate design of Tcl on Windows](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/exec.html#M23), the search path when looking for an executable *always includes the current directory*. Therefore, malicious repositories can ship with an `aspell.exe` in their top-level directory which is executed by Git GUI without giving the user a chance to inspect it first, i.e. running untrusted code.

### Patches

* [91b0797](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/91b07972d93aaa9e67d6fd2ce3c2d776c2872532), also submitted as [prati0100/git-gui#85](https://github.com/prati0100/git-gui/pull/85)

### Workarounds

Avoid using Git GUI for cloning. If that is not a viable option, at least avoid cloning from untrusted sources.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

|  |  | Git v2.30.7 Release Notes |
|  |  | ========================= |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This release addresses the security issues CVE-2022-41903 and |
|  |  | CVE-2022-23521. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Fixes since v2.30.6 |
|  |  | ------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* CVE-2022-41903: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | git log has the ability to display commits using an arbitrary |
|  |  | format with its --format specifiers. This functionality is also |
|  |  | exposed to git archive via the export-subst gitattribute. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When processing the padding operators (e.g., %<(, %<|(, %>(, |
|  |  | %>>(, or %><( ), an integer overflow can occur in |
|  |  | pretty.c::format\_and\_pad\_commit() where a size\_t is improperly |
|  |  | stored as an int, and then added as an offset to a subsequent |
|  |  | memcpy() call. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a |
|  |  | command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., git |
|  |  | log --format=...). It may also be triggered indirectly through |
|  |  | git archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format |
|  |  | specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git |
|  |  | archive. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which |
|  |  | may result in remote code execution. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* CVE-2022-23521: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | gitattributes are a mechanism to allow defining attributes for |
|  |  | paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a `.gitattributes` |
|  |  | file to the repository, which contains a set of file patterns and |
|  |  | the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occur |
|  |  | when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of |
|  |  | attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute |
|  |  | names are huge. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | These overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file |
|  |  | that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines |
|  |  | longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when |
|  |  | parsing them from the index. Consequentially, the failure mode |
|  |  | depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index or |
|  |  | both. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes, |
|  |  | which may result in remote code execution. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Credit for finding CVE-2022-41903 goes to Joern Schneeweisz of GitLab. |
|  |  | An initial fix was authored by Markus Vervier of X41 D-Sec. Credit for |
|  |  | finding CVE-2022-23521 goes to Markus Vervier and Eric Sesterhenn of X41 |
|  |  | D-Sec. This work was sponsored by OSTIF. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The proposed fixes have been polished and extended to cover additional |
|  |  | findings by Patrick Steinhardt of GitLab, with help from others on the |
|  |  | Git security mailing list. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Patrick Steinhardt (21): |
|  |  | attr: fix overflow when upserting attribute with overly long name |
|  |  | attr: fix out-of-bounds read with huge attribute names |
|  |  | attr: fix integer overflow when parsing huge attribute names |
|  |  | attr: fix out-of-bounds write when parsing huge number of attributes |
|  |  | attr: fix out-of-bounds read with unreasonable amount of patterns |
|  |  | attr: fix integer overflow with more than INT\_MAX macros |
|  |  | attr: harden allocation against integer overflows |
|  |  | attr: fix silently splitting up lines longer than 2048 bytes |
|  |  | attr: ignore attribute lines exceeding 2048 bytes |
|  |  | attr: ignore overly large gitattributes files |
|  |  | pretty: fix out-of-bounds write caused by integer overflow |
|  |  | pretty: fix out-of-bounds read when left-flushing with stealing |
|  |  | pretty: fix out-of-bounds read when parsing invalid padding format |
|  |  | pretty: fix adding linefeed when placeholder is not expanded |
|  |  | pretty: fix integer overflow in wrapping format |
|  |  | utf8: fix truncated string lengths in `utf8\_strnwidth()` |
|  |  | utf8: fix returning negative string width |
|  |  | utf8: fix overflow when returning string width |
|  |  | utf8: fix checking for glyph width in `strbuf\_utf8\_replace()` |
|  |  | utf8: refactor `strbuf\_utf8\_replace` to not rely on preallocated buffer |
|  |  | pretty: restrict input lengths for padding and wrapping formats |
|  |  |  |
