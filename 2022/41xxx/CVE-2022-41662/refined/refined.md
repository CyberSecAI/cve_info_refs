- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists when parsing a CGM file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted CGM file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious CGM file with the affected products.
