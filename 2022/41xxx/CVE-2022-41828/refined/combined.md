# Potential remote command execution within redshift-jdbc-42 <= 2.1.0.7

Moderate

[plygrnd](/plygrnd)
published
GHSA-jc69-hjw2-fm86
Oct 11, 2022

## Package

maven

com.amazon.redshift.redshift-jdbc42
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 2.1.0.7

## Patched versions

>= 2.1.0.8

## Description

### Impact

A potential remote command execution issue exists within `redshift-jdbc42` versions 2.1.0.7 and below. When plugins are used with the driver, it instantiates plugin instances based on Java class names provided via the `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, and `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties. In affected versions, the driver does not verify if a plugin class implements the expected interface before instantiatiaton. This can lead to loading of arbitrary Java classes, which a knowledgeable attacker with control over the JDBC URL can use to achieve remote code execution.

### Patches

This issue is patched within `redshift-jdbc-42` 2.1.0.8 and above.

### Workarounds

We advise customers using plugins to upgrade to `redshift-jdbc42` version 2.1.0.8 or above. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact AWS Security at aws-security@amazon.com.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-41828
