The content is related to CVE-2022-41960.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `validateAuthToken` function was implemented in versions of BigBlueButton prior to 2.4.3. An attacker could exploit this by making a Meteor call to the function with an invalid authToken, using a victim's userId and meetingId. This would cause the victim's client to observe the verification failure and force the user to leave the conference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of authToken validation leading to denial of service.
- The client was handling validation responses for other clients, enabling an attacker to force a victim to disconnect from the conference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service, forcing a user to leave the conference.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- An attacker must be a participant in the meeting to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have low privileges, meaning they need only be a regular participant in a BigBlueButton meeting.
- No user interaction is required.
