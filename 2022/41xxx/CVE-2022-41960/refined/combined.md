This is the first release of BigBlueButton 2.5 and includes numerous new features and updates to existing ones.

Note that it runs on Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) and HTML5 client runs on Node 16.

BigBlueButton 2.5-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.5/new.html>

All fixes from BigBlueButton 2.4.x are here up to and including v2.4.4.

Big THANK YOU to all comminuty members who helped for this release - both through sending pull requests and through reporting bugs or requesting enhancements! 🎊

### bbb-webhooks

bbb-webhooks was extracted out of BigBlueButton's main repository into a separate one, still under the same organization <https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-webhooks>

* refactor!(webhooks): remove from main repository [#12535](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12535) bbb-webhooks is now located at <https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-webhooks>

### Release name

In case an administrator does not want to update to the latest bionic-250 version. Use as substitute to the `-v` argument in bbb-install.sh command

`bionic-250-2.5-alpha-1`

We still recommend using `-v bionic-250`.

# DoS via failed authToken validation

Moderate

[antobinary](/antobinary)
published
GHSA-rgjp-3r74-g4cm
Dec 15, 2022

## Package

bbb-html5
(BigBlueButton)

## Affected versions

<2.4.3

## Patched versions

2.5-alpha-1, 2.4.3

## Description

### Impact

The attacker could make a Meteor call to `validateAuthToken` using a victim's userId and meetingId, and including an invalid authToken. This forced the victim to leave the conference, because the resulting verification failure was also observed and handled by the victim's client. The attacker had to be a participant in any meeting on the server.

### Workarounds

No Workarounds

### References

We refactored the authToken validation such that clients only handle answers to its own validation requests.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
