```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-provided input when setting the website name, leading to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browser of any user visiting the admin dashboard, including those who are not logged in. This can lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects the XSS payload via the website name setting. The payload is then stored in the application's database. When users visit the admin dashboard, the unsanitized payload is included in the page and executed in the users' browsers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account in the application and the ability to set the website name. No special privileges are required to perform the attack."
