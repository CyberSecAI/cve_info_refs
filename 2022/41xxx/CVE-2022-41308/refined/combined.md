### Recommendations

Autodesk strongly recommends that users of Autodesk Design Review 2018 and earlier versions download and install the security hotfix referenced above via the[Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Autodesk-Design-Review-2018-Hotfix-7.html). Customers of Autodesk Design Review 2013 or earlier will need to upgrade to version 2018 or later by following the installation instructions outlined in the[Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Autodesk-Design-Review-2018-Hotfix-7.html)article.

Autodesk users of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 versions of Autodesk® Advance Steel, Autodesk® Civil 3D®, AutoCAD®, AutoCAD® LT, and AutoCAD-based specialized toolsets listed in the table above should install the latest AutoCAD® or AutoCAD LT 2023 updates, as applicable, via the Autodesk Desktop App or the [Accounts Portal](https://manage.autodesk.com/).

Customers using previous versions that no longer qualify for full support should plan to upgrade to a supported version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities. Visit the[Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/customer-service/account-management/users-software/previous-versions)for more information about previous version support.
