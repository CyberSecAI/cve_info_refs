{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/pet_shop/admin/?page=orders/view_order&id=` endpoint, specifically through the `id` parameter. The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to potentially access sensitive data from the database, modify data, or perform other unauthorized operations. The provided example demonstrates leaking the database name.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL with a malicious SQL payload injected into the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have knowledge about SQL syntax and how to construct SQL injection payloads."
