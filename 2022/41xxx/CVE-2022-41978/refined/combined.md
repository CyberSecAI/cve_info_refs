I encountered a significant issue when using the Zoho CRM Lead Magnet plugin (version 1.7.8.4) in conjunction with ContactForm7 5.8.6 on WordPress. Upon activating the Zoho CRM Lead Magnet plugin without even configuring form field mappings, the email sending functionality becomes disabled, resulting in a 503 error response upon submission.This problem specifically arises in environments with PHP version 8.0.30.

There is no way to remove a field from a form. (According to their support person) So, once you add a field, the only way to remove it is to start over.
There is no hidden field support – like every other major form plugin. Upon asking support, was told that this would require modifying the wordpress code(?) and to talk to wordpress. (according to their support)
Good concept – a form plugin that directly integrates to the CRM. It fails in the fact that it was developed by people who do not know how to write plugins and a support team that doesn’t understand them. At best this could be considered a beta version, but given the lack of ability to remove fields and the clunky interface, it is probably closer to alpha. What is worse is that if you ask for support, there is a 50% chance that you are told that Zoho is not the producer of the plugin and you have to get to someone who knows better.
Avoid. Run away. Do not use.

I discourage anyone from using this plugin. When it works, it does what it should. When it breaks, don’t rely on Zoho for support. During two years of using the plugin, I’ve repeatedly been told by Zoho that it is simply not a Zoho product. Of course, it is managed and produced by the Zoho extensions team. And of course, occasionally I find someone at the Zoho Extensions team with time to investigate issues with this plugin, obviating the false claim from Zoho support teams that this is not a Zoho product.
Three years after launch the plugin only has 3000 documented installations, which falls well below the threshold for user interest that would encourage reliable developer support.
Zoho CRM email parsers not quite as efficient to set up, but if they break, they do not break functionality of live Webforms. I’ll probably work with Zoho to fix whatever is broken in this, but more likely I’ll be moving all my forms to an email parser for CRM integration.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
