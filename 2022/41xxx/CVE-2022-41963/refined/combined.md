In case an administrator does not want to update to the latest bionic-230 version. Use as substitute to the `-v` argument in bbb-install.sh command

`bionic-240-2.4.3`

We still recommend using `-v bionic-240`.

# Grace period for whiteboard permissions

Low

[antobinary](/antobinary)
published
GHSA-v6p9-926c-6qfp
Dec 15, 2022

## Package

bbb-apps-akka
(BigBlueButton)

## Affected versions

<2.4.3

## Patched versions

2.4.3, 2.5-alpha-1

## Description

### Impact

In the whiteboard we had a grace period that exists to handle delayed messages, but this grace period could be used by attackers to take actions in the few seconds after their access was revoked. The attacker had to be a meeting participant.

### Workarounds

No workaraounds

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
