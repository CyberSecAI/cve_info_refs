- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A manipulated ini file provided to the `fetch()` method in the `BasicProfile` class can lead to a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `ini4j` library is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. Specifically the `fetch()` method in the `BasicProfile` class is susceptible to a crafted ini file input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack will result in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a manipulated ini file provided to the vulnerable method (`fetch()`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious crafted ini file to a process using the vulnerable library.
