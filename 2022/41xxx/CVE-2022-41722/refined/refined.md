Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-41722

**Vulnerability Description:** Path traversal in `filepath.Clean` on Windows.

**Root Cause:**
- The `filepath.Clean` function on Windows could incorrectly transform an invalid relative path containing `..` and an absolute path into a valid absolute path. For example, it could convert `a/../c:/b` to `c:\b`.

**Weakness:**
- Incorrect handling of path cleaning logic on Windows, specifically when dealing with mixed relative and absolute path components.
- The function was transforming relative paths into absolute paths, which circumvents intended access restrictions.

**Impact:**
- Directory traversal attack: By crafting a specific path, an attacker could potentially access files or directories outside of the intended scope.

**Attack Vector:**
- Network: Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability lies in the `filepath.Clean` function that could be used anywhere within an application that takes file paths as input, potentially even in network-facing code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide an invalid path string to an application that uses `filepath.Clean` on Windows.
- No specific privileges are required, and no user interaction is needed for the attack.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue occurs due to the transformation of an invalid path to a valid path. For example, `a/../c:/b` is transformed into `c:\b` instead of remaining relative or being handled as invalid.
- The fix transforms the path into a relative (but still invalid) path: `.\c:\b`.
- This issue affects Go versions before 1.19.6 and from 1.20.0-0 before 1.20.1.
- Affected symbols: `Abs`, `Clean`, `Dir`, `EvalSymlinks`, `Glob`, `IsLocal`, `Join`, `Rel`, `Walk`, and `WalkDir`.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by RyotaK.
- It was addressed in Go versions 1.20.1 and 1.19.6.
