Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the insecure loading of an OpenSSL configuration file. The Windscribe application loads this file from a location where a local attacker can modify it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The application loads the OpenSSL configuration file from an unsecured location, which is vulnerable to tampering by a local attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the target system.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the OpenSSL configuration file to achieve code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must already be able to execute code with low privileges on the target machine.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to the location where the vulnerable OpenSSL config file is located.
