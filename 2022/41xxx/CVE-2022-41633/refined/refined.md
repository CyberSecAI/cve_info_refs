- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Community by PeepSo plugin for WordPress versions <= 6.0.2.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
-  **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact would depend on the actions that the attacker can trigger with a forged request.
- **Attack vectors:**  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious web pages or links that, when visited by a logged-in user, will perform actions on the vulnerable website without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need to have prior access to the WordPress instance.
