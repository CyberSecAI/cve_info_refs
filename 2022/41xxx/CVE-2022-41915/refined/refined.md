{
  "guidelines_followed": "TRUE",
  "relevancy": "RELEVANT",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of header value validation when using an iterator of values in `DefaultHttpHeaders.set`. This allows for the insertion of malicious header values that can cause HTTP Response Splitting.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform HTTP Response Splitting by injecting malicious header values, potentially leading to various attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests where the attacker can control the header values, specifically by injecting an iterator containing malicious header values via `DefaultHttpHeaders.set`.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the header values passed to the vulnerable `DefaultHttpHeaders.set` method. This could occur in scenarios such as web applications using Netty to construct HTTP responses based on user-supplied input."

  "affected_versions": [
    "4.1.83.Final",
    "4.1.84.Final",
    "4.1.85.Final"
  ],
  "patched_versions": [
    "4.1.86.Final"
  ],
 "additonal_notes": "The vulnerability was introduced by the changes in PR #12760, which moved the header value validation to the upper layers but missed validation when using iterators in `DefaultHttpHeaders.set`. The fix was implemented in commit fe18adf by adding the missing validation checks."
