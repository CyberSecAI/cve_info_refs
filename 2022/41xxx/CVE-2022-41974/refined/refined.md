{
  "CVE-2022-41974": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The multipathd daemon calculates command fingerprints by adding keyword codes instead of bitwise ORing them. This allows attackers to craft commands with repeated keywords that bypass authorization checks.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authorization bypass. The multipathd daemon incorrectly authorizes commands based on a flawed fingerprint calculation.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Local users can execute privileged multipathd commands, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attacker sending commands to the multipathd daemon through its abstract Unix socket.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to the system and ability to send commands to the multipathd daemon."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multipathd does not properly validate the command's fingerprint, using addition instead of bitwise OR on the command keywords, allowing for duplicates to be added to create a fingerprint corresponding to a different command.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authorization bypass due to flawed command fingerprint calculation and lack of proper keyword order enforcement.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation, as unprivileged users can execute privileged commands.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attacker sends crafted commands over multipathd's Unix socket.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to send commands over multipathd's unix socket."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The multipathd daemon uses arithmetic addition to compute command fingerprints instead of bitwise OR, allowing attackers to create a fingerprint for a privileged command using unprivileged keywords.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authorization bypass due to flawed command fingerprint calculation. Lack of keyword order enforcement.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation, as unprivileged users can execute privileged commands by crafting specific command sequences.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attacker sends crafted commands via the multipathd Unix socket.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the multipathd Unix socket is required."
