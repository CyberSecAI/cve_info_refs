**Content Overview**

The provided text is a compilation of vulnerability disclosures found by the TIM Vulnerability Research team. It details multiple CVEs affecting various software, including descriptions, impacted versions, proof-of-concept (PoC) steps, and security impacts. The vulnerabilities range from path traversal and XSS to SQL injection and command injection, impacting a variety of products.

**CVE-2022-41761 Details**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Absolute Path Traversal
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The web server fails to sanitize input data, specifically the "logfile" parameter, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files from the file system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker is able to read files on the file system arbitrarily.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A remote authenticated attacker sends a GET request to `cgi-bin/R19.9/viewlog.pl` with a crafted `logfile` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be a remote user authenticated to the web application.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes**

*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including PoC steps and screenshots, detailing how each vulnerability was identified and exploited.
*   The disclosed vulnerabilities span multiple vendors and products, suggesting that the TIM Vulnerability Research team does a wide range of security assessments.
*   The team practices responsible disclosure, first notifying vendors and then publishing details after a patch is released or after a 90-day window.

In summary, the extracted information about CVE-2022-41761 reveals a path traversal vulnerability in a NOKIA product that could allow authenticated attackers to read arbitrary files via a crafted parameter. The vulnerability is detailed, and a step-by-step explanation is provided in the original document.
