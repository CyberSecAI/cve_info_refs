### **[cokeBeer](/cokeBeer)** commented [Nov 15, 2022](#issue-1449687711)

| Hello 👋  I found a potential security issue in lancet, how can I get in touch with you in a private way and submit my security report?  Could you add a SECURITY.md file with an e-mail address for me to send further details to? GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) a security policy to ensure issues are responsibly disclosed, and it would help direct researchers in the future. |
