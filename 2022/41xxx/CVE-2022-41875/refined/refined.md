Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the usage of `oj.load` function in the Optica Ruby gem, which is susceptible to remote code execution (RCE) when parsing untrusted JSON payloads. The `oj.load` function, unlike `oj.safe_load`, doesn't disable features such as `:auto_define` and `:symbol_keys`. These features, when used with malicious JSON data, can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe JSON Parsing:** The `oj.load` function in the affected versions of Optica is vulnerable to the insecure parsing of JSON data. Specifically, the ability to automatically define classes and the use of symbolized keys can be exploited.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-provided JSON input before parsing it with `oj.load`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By sending specially crafted JSON payloads, an attacker can achieve RCE, gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Optica instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JSON Payload Injection:** The attacker needs to send a malicious JSON payload to the vulnerable Optica instance. The payload exploits the unsafe parsing of `oj.load`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, meaning they do not need prior access to the system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application in order to deliver the malicious JSON payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by the GitHub Security Lab to Airbnb on July 26, 2022.
*   A patch was released on July 28, 2022 (version 0.10.2) where `oj.load` was replaced with `oj.safe_load`.
*   `oj.safe_load` disables `:auto_define` and `:symbol_keys`, preventing the vulnerability.
* The `oj` library documentation warns about the dangers of using `oj.load` with untrusted sources and recommends using `oj.safe_load` in such cases.
