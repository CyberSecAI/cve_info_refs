The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability found in the "Open Source SACCO Management System v1.0" by mayuri_k.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/sacco_shield/manage_borrower.php` script, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, potentially modify data, or even gain control of the database server. The provided example leaks the database name, which is "sacco".

**Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is accessible through the HTTP GET method by manipulating the `id` parameter in the `/sacco_shield/manage_borrower.php` URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and has to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.
