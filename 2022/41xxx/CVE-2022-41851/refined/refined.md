- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An uninitialized pointer reference vulnerability exists in the JTTK library while parsing JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is classified as CWE-824, which is "Access of Uninitialized Pointer".
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability could cause the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by tricking a user into opening a malicious JT file with an affected product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious JT file and convince a user to open it with a vulnerable application (JTTK or Simcenter Femap). This implies the attacker needs social engineering or some way of delivering the malicious file to the victim.
