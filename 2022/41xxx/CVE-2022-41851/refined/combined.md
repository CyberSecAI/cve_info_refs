SSA-611756: JT File Parsing Vulnerability in JTTK and Simcenter
Femap

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

SUMMARY

JT Open Toolkit (JTTK) and Simcenter Femap are affected by an uninitialized pointer reference vulnera-
bility that could be triggered while parsing JT ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious JT ﬁle with any
of the affected products, this could cause the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code
execution.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted ﬁles using JTTK or Simcenter Femap

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT Open Toolkit (also known as JTTK) is an application programming interface (API) for developers of
JT-enabled software. The JT Open Toolkit is a read/write toolkit that enables consistent access to JT ﬁle
content.

Simcenter Femap is an advanced simulation application for creating, editing, and inspecting ﬁnite element
models of complex products or systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-41851

The JTTK library is vulnerable to an uninitialized pointer reference vulnerability while parsing specially
crafted JT ﬁles. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the
current process. (ZDI-CAN-16973)
