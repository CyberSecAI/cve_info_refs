{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to an integer overflow when calculating the dimensions of the output tensor within the `BinaryOp` during a broadcast operation. This happens when the dimensions of the input tensors are large, causing the resulting dimensions to exceed the maximum value of an int32 during the calculation. Specifically the multiplication within the Eigen library for output tensor size calculation overflows when broadcasting. This overflow can lead to incorrect size assignments, which results in a crash due to a size mismatch.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The integer overflow leads to a crash due to a size mismatch during broadcast assignment.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing specific input tensors to `tf.keras.losses.poisson` that have very large dimensions. This will then lead to an integer overflow when calculating the output dimensions during broadcasting.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input tensors to `tf.keras.losses.poisson`, and be able to choose tensors with sufficiently large dimensions to trigger the integer overflow."

  "fixes": [
    {
        "commit": "c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c",
        "description": "The fix involves changing the data type used for storing dimensions from `int` to `Eigen::DenseIndex` within the `cwise_ops_common.h` file. This ensures that the dimensions are stored using a type that can hold larger values and prevent the overflow."
