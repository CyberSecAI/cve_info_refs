Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `editcategory.php` file of the Billing System Project v1.0. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before it's used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses the `id` GET parameter in the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including database names, table structures, and data within the tables by crafting specific SQL queries. As demonstrated by the payload, the attacker could extract the database name.
- **Data Modification:** While not explicitly demonstrated, the attacker could also modify or delete data from the database with crafted SQL injection payloads.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** This could potentially lead to a full compromise of the application and its underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `editcategory.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application's URL.
- **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and SQL injection techniques.
- **No Authentication Required:** Based on the provided information, it appears the vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication, since no login is required to access `editcategory.php` and the SQLi is in that page.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides a specific vulnerable file path: `/phpinventory/editcategory.php?id=`.
- A sample payload is provided: `/phpinventory/editcategory.php?id=-1' union select 1,database(),3,4--+`.
- The response to the injected payload was captured in a screenshot.
- The vulnerable software is "Billing System Project v1.0 by mayuri_k".
- The vulnerable software is stated to be built using xmapp-php8.1 version.
- Login credentials for the administrative account are provided "mayurik/rootadmin".
- The vendor link is provided to sourcecodester.com.
- The attacker is identified as Mogui Dong.
