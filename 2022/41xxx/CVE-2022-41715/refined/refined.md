Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-41715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `regexp/syntax` package in Go parses regular expressions. The parsed representation of a regular expression is linear with the size of the input. However, the constant factor could be as high as 40,000 in some cases, leading to excessive memory consumption even for relatively small regex expressions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unbounded Memory Consumption: The parsing process did not limit the maximum memory used to process the regular expression, leading to the potential for memory exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory Exhaustion: Attackers can craft malicious regular expressions that cause the vulnerable application to allocate a large amount of memory.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The excessive memory usage can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Providing untrusted or maliciously crafted regular expressions to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to provide a regular expression that will be processed by the vulnerable code. This could be through user input, reading configuration files, or any other method that allows the application to process the attacker-controlled regular expression.
- No special privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.
- Exploitation can be done remotely through the network.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix limits each regular expression parse to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions that require more space are rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is not affected.
- The vulnerability is present in Go versions prior to 1.18.7 and 1.19.2.
- The vulnerability is located in the `regexp/syntax` package, specifically in the functions related to parsing a regular expression (`Parse`, `parse`, `parser.factor`, `parser.push`, `parser.repeat`).
- The vulnerability has been reported by Adam Korczynski (ADA Logics) and OSS-Fuzz.
