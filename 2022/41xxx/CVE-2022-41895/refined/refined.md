{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `MirrorPadGrad` operation in TensorFlow did not properly validate the input `paddings` values, leading to an out-of-bounds heap read/write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Heap out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted input with outsize `paddings` to the `MirrorPadGrad` operation can cause a heap out-of-bounds error. This could potentially lead to denial of service or other unexpected behavior.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "By providing outsized padding values to the `MirrorPadGrad` operation."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `MirrorPadGrad` operation, specifically control over the `paddings` argument.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was triggered because the code did not check that the total padding size was less than the input dimension size, and also did not validate that padding values are not greater than or equal to the output dimension size. The fix adds these checks."
