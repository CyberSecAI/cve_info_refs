Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of arbitrary data within the `SerializationUtilities#deserializeObjectWithTypeInformation` method in Apache Hive Metastore (HMS). This method is used when filtering and fetching partitions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is the use of `SerializationUtilities#deserializeObjectWithTypeInformation` without proper input validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized data, leading to arbitrary code execution upon deserialization. Specifically, the method does not verify if the object being deserialized is of the expected type (ExprNodeDesc).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the unsafe deserialization, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the Metastore server. This could lead to a compromise of the entire Hive environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when fetching partitions from the Metastore, specifically when the `SerializationUtilities#deserializeObjectWithTypeInformation` method is called with untrusted data.
- The vulnerability can only be exploited by authenticated users/clients that were able to successfully establish a connection to the Metastore.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user or client of the Hive Metastore.
- **Ability to control input to `SerializationUtilities#deserializeObjectWithTypeInformation`:** The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious serialized data to be deserialized by the vulnerable method.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check in the `KryoWithHooks#getRegistration` method to ensure that the first class encountered during deserialization is an `ExprNodeDesc` when processing partition filters. This prevents the deserialization of arbitrary objects that are not `ExprNodeDesc`, effectively mitigating the RCE vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is tracked under the JIRA issue HIVE-26539.
- The fix was implemented in commit `60027bb9c91a93affcfebd9068f064bc1f2a74c9` and is included in version 4.0.0-alpha-2.
