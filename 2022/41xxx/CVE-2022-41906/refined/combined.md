# SSRF in notifications bypasses host deny list

High

[CEHENKLE](/CEHENKLE)
published
GHSA-pfc4-3436-jgrw
Nov 11, 2022

## Package

docker

OpenSearch
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

2.0.x

## Patched versions

>= 2.1.0

## Description

### Impact

A potential SSRF issue in OpenSearch Notifications Plugin could allow an existing privileged user to enumerate listening services or interact with configured resources via HTTP requests exceeding the Notification plugin's intended scope.

### Patches

OpenSearch 2.1.0+ contains the fix for this issue.

### Workarounds

There is no recommended work around.

### References

See pull request [#496](https://github.com/opensearch-project/notifications/pull/496) and [#507](https://github.com/opensearch-project/notifications/pull/507) for additional details.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that contact AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @qreshi **[qreshi](/qreshi)** commented [Aug 4, 2022](#issue-1329131366) • edited Loading

Signed-off-by: Mohammad Qureshi 47198598+qreshi@users.noreply.github.com

### Description

The Notifications deny list setting (`opensearch.notifications.core.http.host_deny_list`) can take in a list of IPs or IP ranges to be blocked so that messages can't be sent against them. Example:

```
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "opensearch":{
      "notifications": {
        "core": {
          "http": {
            "host_deny_list": ["127.0.0.1", "10.0.0.0/8"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

This PR adds hostname resolution before checking against the deny list so that a hostname which is not necessarily an IP (ex. `example.com`) does not bypass the denied IPs.

| It looks like the unit tests are still failing even after adding the stubbing, possible becasue I'm using `mockk` whereas the rest of those tests are using `EasyMock`. The problem is that `EasyMock` can't mock static functions which those utility functions are.  We should be changing to use `mockk` anyway outlined in [#237](https://github.com/opensearch-project/notifications/issues/237) but that's out of scope for this PR. |

This subproject wasn't using `mockk` before. I had to add them similar to what the other subproject did. We can however try to refactor the common stuff into the main `build.gradle` so it doesn't get redeclared. That has some implications though, we can discuss this more as a follow-up.
