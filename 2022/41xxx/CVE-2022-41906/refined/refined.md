Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-41906:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerability in the OpenSearch Notifications plugin. The plugin's host deny list, intended to restrict outgoing HTTP requests, could be bypassed. Specifically, the deny list was checked against the provided hostname without resolving the host to an IP first. This allowed attackers to use a hostname that would resolve to a denied IP. Additionally, the HttpClient used in the webhook implementation was configured to follow redirects, which could lead to the exfiltration of credentials or other malicious activity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the ability for a user to craft a request that forces the server to make HTTP requests to unintended locations.
2.  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The host deny list check didn't perform hostname resolution, failing to block requests to denied IPs via hostnames.
3.  **Following Redirects:** The HttpClient was configured to follow redirects, potentially allowing an attacker to be redirected to internal resources or have credentials sent to a malicious location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Enumeration of Internal Services:** An attacker could scan internal services not intended to be exposed externally.
*   **Interaction with Configured Resources:** An attacker could potentially interact with configured resources within the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Exfiltration of Credentials/Data:** An attacker could potentially redirect requests to a malicious server and exfiltrate credentials and other data sent by the server.
*   **Bypass Intended Scope:** An attacker could make HTTP requests beyond the intended scope of the notification plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is executed by crafting malicious HTTP requests through the Notifications plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User:** The attacker needs to be an existing privileged user of the OpenSearch instance to utilize the notification plugin.
*   **Knowledge of Internal Network:** While not explicitly stated, knowledge of the target's internal network would be beneficial in exploiting the SSRF vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests via the notifications functionality.

**Mitigation:**

The fix was to:

1.  **Resolve Hostnames:** Ensure that hostnames are resolved to IPs before checking against the deny list to prevent hostname bypass.
2.  **Disable Redirects:** Disable following redirects for HTTP clients used for webhook notifications, thus preventing unintended information exposure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text includes references to pull requests ([#496](https://github.com/opensearch-project/notifications/pull/496) and [#507](https://github.com/opensearch-project/notifications/pull/507)) that were part of the fix. PR #496 resolved the host deny list bypass by resolving hostnames to IP addresses. PR #507 disabled following redirects for the HttpClient.
*   The CVSS score for the vulnerability is 7.7 (High), indicating a significant risk.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions 2.0.x of OpenSearch and fixed in version 2.1.0 and later.
*   The CWE associated with the vulnerability is CWE-918, which is "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)."
