Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-41859:

**CVE-2022-41859:** Information leakage in EAP-PWD

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `compute_password_element()` function in the EAP-PWD module leaks information about the password due to the variable number of iterations in the password generation algorithm ("hunting and pecking"). The precise number of iterations depends on the password being used and the token generated by the server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Timing Attack:** The variable number of iterations leaks sensitive information if an attacker can measure the execution time of the algorithm. This allows a password partitioning attack (similar to an offline dictionary attack).
    *   **Cache-Based Attack:** Conditional branches in the password generation algorithm, based on secret values, can leak information via cache-based attacks. An attacker running unprivileged code on the victim machine can determine which branch was taken, allowing them to refine the password search.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can substantially reduce the size of an offline dictionary attack against EAP-PWD passwords by exploiting the information leakage.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Timing attacks:** Require the ability to measure the time taken to derive the password element.
    *  **Cache-based attacks:** Require the attacker to run unprivileged code on the victimâ€™s machine (e.g., a co-located virtual machine or a compromised application on the same machine).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   For timing attacks, the attacker needs to measure the time taken for the server to calculate the password element.
    *   For cache-based attacks, the attacker needs to execute code on the machine running the FreeRADIUS server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mohamed Sabt and his team at the University of Rennes.
*   Similar issues were found and fixed in `hostapd` and `iwd`.
*   The issue was fixed in FreeRADIUS commit `9e5e8f2f`.
