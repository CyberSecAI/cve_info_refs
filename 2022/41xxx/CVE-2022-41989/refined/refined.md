The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41989.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the length of RTLS report payloads during communication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) vulnerability. The software fails to check the length of the payload, allowing an attacker to send a very long payload.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition or code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an excessively long payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system. The attack has a high level of complexity. No specific user privileges are needed (PR:N), but a network position is required.
