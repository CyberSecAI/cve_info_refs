- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication for a critical function. Specifically, the `aprunning` endpoint can be accessed without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication, insecure direct object reference. The vulnerability exists because the application fails to validate the user's authentication status before granting access to the `aprunning` endpoint. This endpoint allows retrieval of arbitrary files within the "RunningConfigs" directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive configuration files such as `UserListInfo.xml`, which may contain administrative passwords, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access. The attacker can send an unauthenticated request to the vulnerable endpoint over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the affected system. No prior authentication is needed, which means an attacker with only network connectivity can exploit this vulnerability.
