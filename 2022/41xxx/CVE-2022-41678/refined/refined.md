{
  "CVE-2022-41678": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a deserialization issue in Jolokia, specifically when handling POST requests via the org.jolokia.http.HttpRequestHandler class. This handler is able to create a JmxRequest through JSONObject which is then executed by org.jolokia.handler.ExecHandler, which is capable of invoking methods via reflection.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Deserialization vulnerability, Remote Code Execution (RCE), insecure reflection usage, and insufficient access control in Jolokia.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user can trigger arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or a Denial of Service (DoS). Specifically, the RCE can be achieved using jdk.management.jfr.FlightRecorderMXBeanImpl on Java 11+, resulting in writing a webshell to a JSP file.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/api/jolokia` endpoint after authenticating with Jolokia.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the Jolokia endpoint and needs to be able to send POST requests to it."
