Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41936:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `modifications` REST endpoint in XWiki did not properly filter out entries based on user access rights. This resulted in the exposure of information that should have been hidden from unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing authorization check:** The primary weakness was the lack of a permission check within the `modifications` REST endpoint. This allowed retrieval of modification history details, including page names and comments, without verifying if the requesting user had the necessary view permissions.
- **Data Leakage:** The vulnerability resulted in a data leak, exposing private information to unauthorized actors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized users could access sensitive information related to content modifications, which would have otherwise been restricted. This includes page names, modification comments, and potentially other metadata about content hidden from the user through the web UI.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through the REST API.
- **Direct API request:** An attacker could send a crafted HTTP request to the `/xwiki/rest/wikis/xwiki/modifications` endpoint with parameters such as `start`, `number`, and `date` to extract modification information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication required:** An attacker did not require any specific credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The missing authorization check meant that unauthenticated users could retrieve the exposed data.
- **Network access:** The attacker needed to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable XWiki instance.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-359, "Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
- The issue was resolved in XWiki versions 14.6, 14.4.3, and 13.10.8 and later.
- The fix involved adding a permission check to the `modifications` REST endpoint to ensure that only users with the necessary view permissions can retrieve modification history.
- The vulnerability is rated as moderate with a CVSS score of 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
- The related Jira issue is XWIKI-19997 and the related Github security advisory is GHSA-p88w-fhxw-xvcc.
