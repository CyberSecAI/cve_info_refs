The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41390.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `cod` parameter in multiple endpoints of the OcoMon HelpDesk application, which allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection in the `cod` parameter.
- Lack of input sanitization leading to direct insertion of user-controlled data into SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive data by injecting malicious SQL code.
- The identified exploitation vector allows for blind SQL injection, which means an attacker can indirectly infer the content of the database based on the server's response time. The provided example uses `sleep(40)` to demonstrate the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to multiple vulnerable endpoints.
- Specifically, the `cod` parameter is the entry point for the SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional details:**
- The content provides examples of vulnerable URLs: `http://target:8000/ocomon-4.0RC1/includes/functions/download.php?file=3134&cod=(select*from(select(sleep(40))a)` and `http://target:8000/ocomon-4.0RC1/includes/functions/showImg.php?file=3134&cod=(select*from(select(sleep(40))a)`.
- The content lists 36 endpoints, other than those in the example urls, that are also vulnerable.
- The file names and paths suggest that the software affected is "OcoMon 4.0RC1".
- The example code snippet `if (isset($_GET['cod'])) { $query .= "WHERE dom_cod = ".$_GET['cod']." }` illustrates the lack of sanitization.
