- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Prototype pollution via Cloud Code Webhooks. A compromised Parse Server Cloud Code Webhook target endpoint allows an attacker to use prototype pollution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Prototype pollution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Bypass the Parse Server `requestKeywordDenylist` option.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation. The vulnerability can be triggered via a compromised webhook target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to compromise a Parse Server Cloud Code Webhook target endpoint and needs high privileges on the server.
