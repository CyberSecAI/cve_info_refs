The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41239.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:** The DotCi Plugin does not properly escape the GitHub username parameter when displaying commit notifications, resulting in a stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input (GitHub user name in commit notifications) before displaying it on the Jenkins UI.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the commit notifications displayed in the build cause, which will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they view the build history. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by submitting crafted commit notifications to the `/githook/` endpoint, which the DotCi plugin processes.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit commit notifications to the `/githook/` endpoint. This can be achieved by having write access to the git repository linked to a Jenkins job configured with the DotCi Plugin. Additionally, the vulnerability is exploitable in Jenkins 2.314 and earlier, LTS 2.303.1 and earlier.
