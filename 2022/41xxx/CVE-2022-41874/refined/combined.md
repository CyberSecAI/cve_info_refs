# The Filesystem Scope can be Partially Bypassed

Low

[lucasfernog](/lucasfernog)
published
GHSA-q9wv-22m9-vhqh
Nov 8, 2022

## Package

Tauri
(Tauri-Apps)

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.0, <1.0.7
>= 1.1.0, <1.1.2

## Patched versions

1.0.7
>= 1.1.2

## Description

### Impact

Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality,

it was possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope definition.

It was not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths, as the issue was limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed paths.

The impact differs on Windows, MacOS and Linux due to different specifications of valid path characters.

On Linux or MacOS based systems it was possible to use the `*`, `**` and `[a-Z]` patterns inside a path,

which allowed to read the content of sub directories and single character

files in a folder, where only specific files or the directory itself were allowed.

On Windows `[a-Z]` was the possible bypass pattern, as `*` is not treated as a valid path

component. This implies that only single character files inside an already allowed directory

were unintentionally accessible.

This bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files, as user selected paths are automatically

added to the allow list at runtime.

A successful bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files.

This means the issue by itself can not be abused and requires further intentional or unintentional privileges.

### Workaround

Disable the `dialog` and `fileDropEnabled` component inside the `tauri.conf.json`.

### Patches

The issue has been resolved in [#5237](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5237) and the implementation now properly escapes

the special characters. The patch has been included in releases: `1.0.7`, `1.1.2` and `1.2.0`
