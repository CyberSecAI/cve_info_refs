- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is improper handling of special characters (`*`, `**`, `[a-Z]`) within file paths, leading to a partial bypass of the filesystem scope. This bypass allows access to neighboring files and subfolders of allowed paths which was not intended.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - On Linux and MacOS, attackers could use wildcard characters to read the contents of subdirectories and single-character files within a folder, even if only specific files or the directory itself was allowed.
    - On Windows, the vulnerability allowed access to single-character files inside allowed directories
    -  The issue requires a pre-existing malicious file or directory and adversary-controlled logic to access it, limiting the impact to a partial bypass of the `fs` scope.
- **Attack vectors:** File selection through the file picker dialog or by dragging and dropping files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have the user select a malicious file or directory.
    - The attacker needs control over the application logic to access the selected files.
