Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-04bc7cd075
2022-10-02 00:17:13.956586
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : kitty
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 0.26.3
Release : 2.fc37
URL : <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty>
Summary : Cross-platform, fast, feature full, GPU based terminal emulator
Description :
- Offloads rendering to the GPU for lower system load and buttery smooth
scrolling. Uses threaded rendering to minimize input latency.

- Supports all modern terminal features: graphics (images), unicode, true-color,
OpenType ligatures, mouse protocol, focus tracking, bracketed paste and
several new terminal protocol extensions.

- Supports tiling multiple terminal windows side by side in different layouts
without needing to use an extra program like tmux.

- Can be controlled from scripts or the shell prompt, even over SSH.

- Has a framework for Kittens, small terminal programs that can be used to
extend kitty's functionality. For example, they are used for Unicode input,
Hints and Side-by-side diff.

- Supports startup sessions which allow you to specify the window/tab layout,
working directories and programs to run on startup.

- Cross-platform: kitty works on Linux and macOS, but because it uses only
OpenGL for rendering, it should be trivial to port to other Unix-like
platforms.

- Allows you to open the scrollback buffer in a separate window using arbitrary
programs of your choice. This is useful for browsing the history comfortably
in a pager or editor.

- Has multiple copy/paste buffers, like vim.

# Changelog[¶](#changelog "Link to this heading")

*kitty* is a feature-rich, cross-platform, *fast*, GPU based terminal.
To update *kitty*, [follow the instructions](../binary/).

## Recent major new features[¶](#recent-major-new-features "Link to this heading")

### Cursor trails [0.37][¶](#cursor-trails-0-37 "Link to this heading")

Show an animated trail when the text cursor makes large jumps making it easy
to follow cursor movements. Inspired by the similar feature in neovide, but
works with terminal multiplexers and kitty windows as well. See [the pull
request](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/7970) for a demonstration video. This feature is optional and must be
turned on by the [`cursor_trail`](../conf/#opt-kitty.cursor_trail) option in `kitty.conf`.

### Variable font support [0.36][¶](#variable-font-support-0-36 "Link to this heading")

Terminal aficionados spend all day staring at text, so getting text
rendering just right is very important. In that spirit, kitty now supports
[OpenType Variable fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_font).
These allow precise customisation of font characteristics, such as weight and
spacing. Not only that, kitty now has a new [choose-fonts](../kittens/choose-fonts/) kitten that provides a UI for choosing fonts with
support for font features, variable fonts and previews of how the font will
look. This is in addition to its existing best-in-class font customization
abilities, such as: [`symbol_map`](../conf/#opt-kitty.symbol_map), [`text_composition_strategy`](../conf/#opt-kitty.text_composition_strategy),
[`font_features`](../conf/#opt-kitty.font_features) and [`modify_font`](../conf/#opt-kitty.modify_font). kitty knows text rendering is
important, and goes the extra mile for it.

### Desktop notifications [0.36][¶](#desktop-notifications-0-36 "Link to this heading")

*kitty* now has a [notify](../kittens/notify/) kitten that can be used to
display desktop notifications from the command line, even over SSH. It has
support for icons, buttons, updating notifications, waiting till
the notification is closed, etc. The underlying [Desktop notifications](../desktop-notifications/)
protocol has been expanded to support all these features.

### Wayland goodies [0.34][¶](#wayland-goodies-0-34 "Link to this heading")

Wayland users should rejoice as kitty now comes with major Wayland
quality-of-life improvements:

* Draw GPU accelerated [desktop panels and background](../kittens/panel/)
  running arbitrary terminal programs. For example, run [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/) as your desktop background
* Background blur for transparent windows is now supported under KDE
  using a custom KDE specific protocol
* The kitty window decorations in GNOME are now fully functional with buttons
  and they follow system dark/light mode automatically
* kitty now supports fractional scaling in Wayland which means pixel perfect
  rendering when you use a fractional scale with no wasted performance on
  resizing an overdrawn pixmap in the compositor

With this release kitty’s Wayland support is now on par with X11, provided
you use a decent Wayland compositor.

### Cheetah speed 🐆 [0.33][¶](#cheetah-speed-0-33 "Link to this heading")

kitty has grown up and become a cheetah. It now parses data it receives in
parallel [using SIMD vector CPU instructions](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/7005) for a 2x speedup in
benchmarks and a 10%-50% real world speedup depending on workload. There is a
new benchmarking kitten `kitten __benchmark__` that can be used to measure
terminal throughput. There is also [a table](../performance/#throughput) showing kitty is
much faster than other terminal emulators based on the benchmark kitten. While
kitty was already so fast that its performance was never a bottleneck, this
improvement makes it even faster and more importantly reduces the energy
consumption to do the same tasks.

  --program`](../kittens/hints/#cmdoption-kitty-kitten-hints-program) option work when using the `self`

  [Comprehensive keyboard handling in terminals](../keyboard-protocol/) ([#3248](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3248))
* **Backward incompatibility**: Session files now use the full [launch](../launch/)
  command with all its capabilities. However, the syntax of the command is
  slightly different from before. In particular watchers are now specified
  directly on launch and environment variables are set using `--env`.
* Allow setting colors when creating windows using the [launch](../launch/) command.

  with XTerm ([#3193](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/3193))
* The launch command now does more sophisticated resolving of executables to
  run. The system-wide PATH is used first, then system specific default paths,
  and finally the PATH inside the shell.
* Double clicking on empty tab bar area now opens a new tab ([#3201](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3201))

  the key matches an English key, send that to the program running in the
  terminal automatically ([#2000](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/2000))
* When matching shortcuts, also match on shifted keys, so a shortcut defined as

  some reason puts empty glyphs after the ligature glyph rather than before it
  ([#3313](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3313))
* Improve handling of infinite length ligatures in newer versions of FiraCode
  and CascadiaCode. Now such ligatures are detected based on glyph naming
  convention. This removes the gap in the ligatures at cell boundaries ([#2695](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/2695))
* macOS: Disable the native operating system tabs as they are non-functional
  and can be confusing ([#3325](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3325))

* macOS: Switch to using the User Notifications framework for notifications.
  The current notifications framework has been deprecated in Big Sur. The new
  framework only allows notifications from signed and notarized applications,

  switch to the previously used window layout ([#870](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/870))
* New `neighboring_window` and `move_window` functions to switch to
  neighboring windows in the current layout, and move them around, similar to
  window movement in vim ([#916](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/916))
* A new `pipe` function that can be used to pipe the contents of the screen
  and scrollback buffer to any desired program running in a new window, tab or

* macOS: Add a new [`macos_thicken_font`](../conf/#opt-kitty.macos_thicken_font) to make text rendering
  on macs thicker, which makes it similar to the result of
  sub-pixel antialiasing ([#950](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/950))
* macOS: Add an option [`macos_traditional_fullscreen`](../conf/#opt-kitty.macos_traditional_fullscreen) to make
  full-screening of kitty windows much faster, but less pretty. ([#911](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/911))

  using standard keyboards) via [IBus](https://github.com/ibus/ibus/wiki/ReadMe) ([#469](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/469))
* Implement completion for the kitty command in bash and zsh. See
  [Shell integration](../shell-integration/#shell-integration).
* Render the text under the cursor in a fixed color, configurable via
  the option [`cursor_text_color`](../conf/#opt-kitty.cursor_text_color) ([#126](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/126))
* Add an option [`env`](../conf/#opt-kitty.env) to set environment variables in child processes
  from kitty.conf
* Add an action to the `clear_terminal` function to scroll the screen
  contents into the scrollback buffer ([#1113](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/1113))
* Implement high precision scrolling with the trackpad on platforms such as
  macOS and Wayland that implement it. ([#819](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/819))
* macOS: Allow scrolling window contents using mouse wheel/trackpad even when the
  window is not the active window ([#729](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/729))
* Remote control: Allow changing the current window layout with a new
  [kitten @ goto-layout](../remote-control/#at-goto-layout) command ([#845](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/845))
* Remote control: Allow matching windows by the environment variables of their
  child process as well
* Allow running kittens via the remote control system ([#738](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/738))
* Allow enabling remote control in only some kitty windows
* Add a keyboard shortcut to reset the terminal ([`ctrl+shift+delete`](../conf/#shortcut-kitty.Reset-the-terminal)). It
  takes parameters so you can define your own shortcuts to clear the
  screen/scrollback also ([#747](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/747))
* Fix one-pixel line appearing at window edges at some window sizes when
  displaying images with background opacity enabled ([#741](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/741))
* diff kitten: Fix error when right hand side file is binary and left hand side
  file is text ([#752](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/752))
* kitty @ new-window: Add a new option [`kitten @ new-window --window-type`](../remote-control/#cmdoption-kitten-new-window-window-type)
  to create top-level OS windows ([#770](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/770))
* macOS: The [`focus_follows_mouse`](../conf/#opt-kitty.focus_follows_mouse) option now also works across top-level kitty OS windows
  ([#754](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/754))
* Fix detection of URLs in HTML source code (URLs inside quotes) ([#785](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/785))
* Implement support for emoji skin tone modifiers ([#787](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/787))
* Round-trip the zwj unicode character. Rendering of sequences containing zwj
  is still not implemented, since it can cause the collapse of an unbounded
  number of characters into a single cell. However, kitty at least preserves
  the zwj by storing it as a combining character.
* macOS: Disable the custom mouse cursor. Using a custom cursor fails on dual
  GPU machines. I give up, Apple users will just have to live with the
  limitations of their choice of OS. ([#794](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/794))
* macOS: Fix control+tab key combination not working ([#801](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/801))
* Linux: Fix slow startup on some systems caused by GLFW searching for
  joysticks. Since kitty does not use joysticks, disable joystick support.

### 0.11.3 [2018-07-10][¶](#id86 "Link to this heading")

* Draw only the minimum borders needed for inactive windows. That is only the borders
  that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note that setting
  a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all borders to be drawn.
  The old behavior of drawing all borders can be restored via the
  [`draw_minimal_borders`](../conf/#opt-kitty.draw_minimal_borders) setting in kitty.conf. ([#699](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/699))
* macOS: Add an option [`macos_window_resizable`](../conf/#opt-kitty.macos_window_resizable) to control if kitty
  top-level windows are resizable using the mouse or not ([#698](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/698))

  ([#359](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/359))
* macOS: Workaround for switching from fullscreen to windowed mode with the
  titlebar hidden causing window resizing to not work. ([#711](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/711))
* Fix triple-click to select line not working when the entire line is filled
  ([#703](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/703))
* When dragging to select with the mouse “grab” the mouse so that if it strays
  into neighboring windows, the selection is still updated ([#624](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/624))
* When clicking in the margin/border area of a window, map the click to the
  nearest cell in the window. Avoids selection with the mouse failing when
  starting the selection just outside the window.
* When drag-scrolling stop the scroll when the mouse button is released.
* Fix a regression in the previous release that caused pasting large amounts
  of text to be duplicated ([#709](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/709))

  user migrates their kitty cache directory between systems with incompatible
  readline implementations.
* macOS: Fix an error in remote control when using --listen-on ([#679](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/679))

* Add an option [`single_window_margin_width`](../conf/#opt-kitty.single_window_margin_width) to allow different margins
  when only a single window is visible in the layout ([#688](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/688))
* Add a [`kitty --hold`](../invocation/#cmdoption-kitty-hold) command line option to stay open after the child process exits ([#667](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/667))
* diff kitten: When triggering a search scroll to the first match automatically
* [`kitty --debug-font-fallback`](../invocation/#cmdoption-kitty-debug-font-fallback) also prints out what basic fonts were matched
* When closing a kitty window reset the mouse cursor to its default shape and ensure it is visible ([#655](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/655)).
* Remote control: Speed-up reading of command responses
* Linux installer: Fix installer failing on systems with python < 3.5
* Support “-T” as an alias for “--title” ([#659](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/659))
* Fix a regression in the previous release that broke using
  `--debug-config` with custom key mappings ([#695](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/695))

### 0.11.1 [2018-06-17][¶](#id88 "Link to this heading")

* diff kitten: Implement searching for text in the diff ([#574](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/574))

  default startup session ([#641](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/641))
* Add a command line option [`kitty --wait-for-single-instance-window-close`](../invocation/#cmdoption-kitty-wait-for-single-instance-window-close)
  to make [`kitty --single-instance`](../invocation/#cmdoption-kitty-single-instance) wait for the closing of the newly opened
  window before quitting ([#630](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/630))
* diff kitten: Allow theming the selection background/foreground as well
* diff kitten: Display CRLF line endings using the unicode return symbol
  instead of <d> as it is less intrusive ([#638](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/638))
* diff kitten: Fix default foreground/background colors not being restored when
  kitten quits ([#637](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/637))
* Fix [`kitten @ set-colors --all`](../remote-control/#cmdoption-kitten-set-colors-all) not working when more than one window
  present ([#632](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/632))
* Fix a regression that broke the legacy increase/decrease\_font\_size actions
* Clear scrollback on reset ([#631](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/631))

  See [`tab_bar_style`](../conf/#opt-kitty.tab_bar_style) and [`tab_fade`](../conf/#opt-kitty.tab_fade) for details. The old look can be
  restored by setting [`tab_bar_style`](../conf/#opt-kitty.tab_bar_style) to `separator`.
* [Pre-compiled binaries](../binary/) with all bundled dependencies for Linux
  ([#595](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/595))
* A [new kitten](../kittens/panel/) to create dock panels on X11 desktops
  showing the output from arbitrary terminal programs.
* Reduce data sent to the GPU per render by 30% ([commit: 8dea5b3e3e](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/commit/8dea5b3e3ec1db8597f3a3649b5cefd52f41e409))
* Implement changing the font size for individual top level (OS) windows
  ([#408](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/408))
* When viewing the scrollback in less using [`ctrl+shift+h`](../conf/#shortcut-kitty.Browse-scrollback-buffer-in-pager) and kitty
  is currently scrolled, position the scrollback in less to match kitty’s
  scroll position. ([#148](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/148))

  working if no kitty window currently has focus. ([#524](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/524))
* macOS: Keep kitty running even when the last window is closed. This is in
  line with how applications are supposed to behave on macOS ([#543](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/543)).
  There is a new option ([`macos_quit_when_last_window_closed`](../conf/#opt-kitty.macos_quit_when_last_window_closed)) to control
  this.
* macOS: Add macOS standard shortcuts for copy, paste and new OS window
  (⌘+C, ⌘+V, ⌘+N)

  By default only writing is allowed. This feature is supported in many
  terminals, search for OSC 52 clipboard to find out more about using it.
* Fix moving cursor outside a defined page area incorrectly causing the cursor
  to be placed inside the page area. Caused incorrect rendering in neovim, in
  some situations ([#542](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/542)).
* Render a couple more powerline symbols directly, bypassing the font
  ([#550](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/550)).
* Fix ctrl+alt+<special> not working in normal and application keyboard ([#548](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/548)).
* Partial fix for rendering Right-to-left languages like Arabic. Rendering of
  Arabic is never going to be perfect, but now it is at least readable.
* Fix Ctrl+backspace acting as plain backspace in normal and application
  keyboard modes ([#538](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/538)).
* Have the paste\_from\_selection action paste from the clipboard on platforms
  that do not have a primary selection such as Wayland and macOS
  ([#529](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/529))
* Fix cursor\_stop\_blinking\_after=0 not working ([#530](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/530))

### 0.9.1 [2018-05-05][¶](#id92 "Link to this heading")

* Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the windows in the tab and
  the window is not the currently focused window
* Change the window border color if a bell occurs in an unfocused window. Can
  be disabled by setting the bell\_border\_color to be the same as the
  inactive\_border\_color.
* macOS: Add support for dead keys
* Unicode input: When searching by name search for prefix matches as well as
  whole word matches
* Dynamically allocate the memory used for the scrollback history buffer.
  Reduces startup memory consumption when using very large scrollback
  buffer sizes.
* Add an option to not request window attention on bell.
* Remote control: Allow matching windows by number (visible position).
* macOS: Fix changing tab title and kitty shell not working
* When triple-clicking select all wrapped lines belonging to a single logical line.
* hints kitten: Detect bracketed URLs and don’t include the closing bracket in the URL.
* When calling pass\_selection\_to\_program use the current directory of the child
  process as the cwd of the program.
* Add macos\_hide\_from\_tasks option to hide kitty from the macOS task switcher
* macOS: When the macos\_titlebar\_color is set to background change the titlebar
  colors to match the current background color of the active kitty window
* Add a setting to clear all shortcuts defined up to that point in the config
  file(s)
* Add a setting (kitty\_mod) to change the modifier used by all the default
  kitty shortcuts, globally
* Fix Shift+function key not working
* Support the F13 to F25 function keys
* Don’t fail to start if the user deletes the hintstyle key from their
  fontconfig configuration.
* When rendering a private use unicode codepoint and a space as a two cell
  ligature, set the foreground colors of the space cell to match the colors of
  the first cell. Works around applications like powerline that use different
  colors for the two cells.
* Fix passing @text to other programs such as when viewing the scrollback
  buffer not working correctly if kitty is itself scrolled up.
* Fix window focus gained/lost events not being reported to child programs when
  switching windows/tabs using the various keyboard shortcuts.
* Fix tab title not changing to reflect the window title when switching between different windows in a tab
* Ignore -e if it is specified on the command line. This is for compatibility
  with broken software that assumes terminals should run with an -e option to
  execute commands instead of just passing the commands as arguments.

### 0.9.0 [2018-04-15][¶](#id93 "Link to this heading")

* A new kitty command shell to allow controlling kitty via commands. Press
  ctrl+shift+escape to run the shell.
* The hints kitten has become much more powerful. Now in addition to URLs you
  can use it to select word, paths, filenames, lines, etc. from the screen.
  These can be inserted into the terminal, copied to clipboard or sent to
  external programs.
* Linux: Switch to libxkbcommon for keyboard handling. It allows kitty to
  support XCompose and dead keys and also react to keyboard remapping/layout
  change without needing a restart.

* A new remote control command set-colors to change the current and/or
  configured colors.
* When double-clicking to select a word, select words that continue onto the
  next/prev line as well.

* Fix using kitty --single-instance to open a new window in a running kitty
  instance, not respecting the --directory flag
* URL hints: Exclude trailing punctuation from URLs
* URL hints: Launch the browser from the kitty parent process rather than the
  hints kitten. Fixes launching on some systems where xdg-open doesn’t like
  being run from a kitten.
* Allow using rectangle select mode by pressing shift in addition to the
  rectangle select modifiers even when the terminal program has grabbed the
  mouse.

### 0.8.4 [2018-03-31][¶](#id94 "Link to this heading")

* Fix presence of XDG\_CONFIG\_DIRS and absence of XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME preventing
  kitty from starting
* Revert change in last release to cell width calculation. Instead just clip
  the right edges of characters that overflow the cell by at most two pixels

### 0.8.3 [2018-03-29][¶](#id95 "Link to this heading")

* Fix a regression that broke the visual bell and invert screen colors escape

  time or line at a time
* Add a keyboard shortcut to set the tab title
* Fix setting window title to empty via OSC escape code not working correctly
* Linux: Fix cell width calculation incorrect for some fonts (cell widths are
  now calculated by actually rendering bitmaps, which is slower but more
  accurate)
* Allow specifying a system wide kitty config file, for all users
* Add a --debug-config command line flag to output data about the system and
  kitty configuration.

* macOS: Fix restoring of window size not correct on Retina screens
* macOS: Add a facility to specify command line arguments when running kitty from the GUI
* Add a focus-tab remote command
* Fix screen not being refreshed immediately after moving a window.
* Fix a crash when getting the contents of the scrollback buffer as text

### 0.8.1 [2018-03-09][¶](#id97 "Link to this heading")

* Extend kitty’s remote control feature to work over both UNIX and TCP sockets,
  so now you can control kitty from across the internet, if you want to.
* Render private use unicode characters that are followed by a space as a two
  character ligature. This fixes rendering for applications that misuse
  private-use characters to display square symbols.
* Fix Unicode emoji presentation variant selector causing new a fallback font
  instance to be created
* Fix a rare error that prevented the Unicode input kitten from working
  sometimes

  inside kitty and extend its capabilities. Examples include unicode input and
  selecting URLs with the keyboard.
* Input arbitrary unicode characters by pressing Ctrl+Shift+u. You can choose
  characters by name, by hex code, by recently used, etc. There is even and
  editable Favorites list.
* Open URLs using only the keyboard. kitty has a new “hints mode”. Press
  Ctrl+Shift+e and all detected URLs on the screen are highlighted with a key
  to press to open them. The facility is customizable so you can change
  what is detected as a URL and which program is used to open it.
* Add an option to change the titlebar color of kitty windows on macOS
* Only consider Emoji characters with default Emoji presentation to be two
  cells wide. This matches the standard. Also add support for the Unicode Emoji
  variation presentation selector.
* Prevent video tearing during high speed scrolling by syncing draws
  to the monitor’s refresh rate. There is a new configuration option to
  control this `sync_to_monitor`.
* When displaying only a single window, use the default background color of the
  window (which can be changed via escape codes) as the color for the margin
  and padding of the window.
* Add some non standard terminfo capabilities used by neovim and tmux.
* Fix large drop in performance when using multiple top-level windows on macOS
* Fix save/restore of window sizes not working correctly.
* Remove option to use system wcwidth(). Now always use a wcwidth() based on
  the Unicode standard. Only sane way.
* Fix a regression that caused a few ligature glyphs to not render correctly in
  rare circumstances.
* Browsing the scrollback buffer now happens in an overlay window instead of a
  new window/tab.

### 0.7.1 [2018-01-31][¶](#id99 "Link to this heading")

* Add an option to adjust the width of character cells
* Fix selecting text with the mouse in the scrollback buffer selecting text

* Fix regression that broke drawing of hollow cursor when window loses focus

### 0.6.0 [2017-12-18][¶](#id102 "Link to this heading")

* Support background transparency via the background\_opacity option. Provided
  that your OS/window manager supports transparency, you can now have kitty
  render pixels that have only the default background color as
  semi-transparent.
* Support multiple top level (OS) windows. These windows all share the sprite
  texture cache on the GPU, further reducing overall resource usage. Use
  the shortcut ctrl+shift+n to open a new top-level window.
* Add support for a *daemon* mode using the --single-instance command line
  option. With this option you can have only a single kitty instance running.
  All future invocations simply open new top-level windows in the existing
  instance.
* Support colored emoji
* Use CoreText instead of FreeType to render text on macOS

  separator)
* Allow drag and drop of files into kitty. On drop kitty will paste the
  file path to the running program.
* Add an option to control the underline style for URL highlighting on hover
* X11: Set the WINDOWID environment variable
* Fix middle and right buttons swapped when sending mouse events to child
  processes
* Allow selecting in a rectangle by holding down Ctrl+Alt while dragging with
  the mouse.

### 0.5.1 [2017-12-01][¶](#id103 "Link to this heading")

* Add an option to control the thickness of lines in box drawing characters
* Increase max. allowed ligature length to nine characters
* Fix text not vertically centered when adjusting line height
* Fix unicode block characters not being rendered properly
* Fix shift+up/down not generating correct escape codes
* Image display: Fix displaying images taller than two screen heights not
  scrolling properly

### 0.5.0 [2017-11-19][¶](#id104 "Link to this heading")

* Add support for ligature fonts such as Fira Code, Hasklig, etc. kitty now
  uses harfbuzz for text shaping which allow it to support advanced OpenType
  features such as contextual alternates/ligatures/combining glyphs/etc.
* Make it easy to select fonts by allowing listing of monospace fonts using:
  kitty list-fonts
* Add an option to have window focus follow mouse
* Add a keyboard shortcut (ctrl+shift+f11) to toggle fullscreen mode
* macOS: Fix handling of option key. It now behaves just like the alt key on
  Linux. There is an option to make it type unicode characters instead.
* Linux: Add support for startup notification on X11 desktops. kitty will
  now inform the window manager when its startup is complete.
* Fix shell prompt being duplicated when window is resized
* Fix crash when displaying more than 64 images in the same session
* Add support for colons in SGR color codes. These are generated by some
  applications such as neovim when they mistakenly identify kitty as a libvte
  based terminal.
* Fix mouse interaction not working in apps using obsolete mouse interaction
  protocols
* Linux: no longer require glew as a dependency

### 0.4.2 [2017-10-23][¶](#id105 "Link to this heading")

* Fix a regression in 0.4.0 that broke custom key mappings
* Fix a regression in 0.4.0 that broke support for non-QWERTY keyboard layouts
* Avoid using threads to reap zombie child processes. Also prevent kitty from
  hanging if the open program hangs when clicking on a URL.

### 0.4.0 [2017-10-22][¶](#id106 "Link to this heading")

* Support for drawing arbitrary raster graphics (images) in the terminal via a
  new graphics protocol. kitty can draw images with full 32-bit color using both
  ssh connections and files/shared memory (when available) for better
  performance. The drawing primitives support alpha blending and z-index.
  Images can be drawn both above and below text. See [Terminal graphics protocol](../graphics-protocol/).
  for details.
* Refactor kitty’s internals to make it even faster and more efficient. The CPU
  usage of kitty + X server while doing intensive tasks such as scrolling a
  file continuously in less has been reduced by 50%. There are now two
  configuration options `repaint_delay` and `input_delay` you can use to
  fine tune kitty’s performance vs CPU usage profile. The CPU usage of kitty +
  X when scrolling in less is now significantly better than most (all?) other
  terminals. See [Performance](../performance/).
* Hovering over URLs with the mouse now underlines them to indicate they
  can be clicked. Hold down Ctrl+Shift while clicking to open the URL.
* Selection using the mouse is now more intelligent. It does not add
  blank cells (i.e. cells that have no content) after the end of text in a
  line to the selection.
* The block cursor in now fully opaque but renders the character under it in
  the background color, for enhanced visibility.
* Allow combining multiple independent actions into a single shortcut
* Add a new shortcut to pass the current selection to an external program
* Allow creating shortcuts to open new windows running arbitrary commands. You
  can also pass the current selection to the command as an arguments and the
  contents of the screen + scrollback buffer as stdin to the command.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-d718af66d1
2022-10-02 01:20:33.134177
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : kitty
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 0.26.3
Release : 2.fc36
URL : <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty>
Summary : Cross-platform, fast, feature full, GPU based terminal emulator
Description :
- Offloads rendering to the GPU for lower system load and buttery smooth
scrolling. Uses threaded rendering to minimize input latency.

- Supports all modern terminal features: graphics (images), unicode, true-color,
OpenType ligatures, mouse protocol, focus tracking, bracketed paste and
several new terminal protocol extensions.

- Supports tiling multiple terminal windows side by side in different layouts
without needing to use an extra program like tmux.

- Can be controlled from scripts or the shell prompt, even over SSH.

- Has a framework for Kittens, small terminal programs that can be used to
extend kitty's functionality. For example, they are used for Unicode input,
Hints and Side-by-side diff.

- Supports startup sessions which allow you to specify the window/tab layout,
working directories and programs to run on startup.

- Cross-platform: kitty works on Linux and macOS, but because it uses only
OpenGL for rendering, it should be trivial to port to other Unix-like
platforms.

- Allows you to open the scrollback buffer in a separate window using arbitrary

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

# Kitty: Arbitrary Code Execution — GLSA **202209-22**

A vulnerability has been found in Kitty which could allow for arbitrary code execution with user input.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-terms/kitty** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.26.2** |

### Background

Kitty is a fast, feature-rich, GPU-based terminal.

### Description

Carter Sande discovered that maliciously constructed control sequences can cause Kitty to display a notification that, when clicked, can cause Kitty to execute arbitrary commands.

### Impact

Kitty can produce notifications that, when clicked, can execute arbitrary commands.

### Workaround

Avoid clicking unexpected notifications.

### Resolution

All Kitty users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync

| [Description](#c0)  Carter Sande    2022-09-05 06:39:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 803263](attachment.cgi?id=803263 "POC text file (runs \"gnome-calculator\" when notification clicked)") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=803263&action=edit "POC text file (runs \"gnome-calculator\" when notification clicked)")] POC text file (runs "gnome-calculator" when notification clicked)  In Kitty versions 0.26.1 and below, maliciously-constructed control sequences can cause Kitty to display a notification that, when clicked, causes Kitty to execute arbitrary commands. (This could happen if someone uses "cat", "curl", or similar commands to view untrusted content in Kitty.)  The issue was fixed in Kitty version 0.26.2 and immediately disclosed in the changelog for that version. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2022-09-05 06:59:17 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=26e4741f77fb5a51daf4f54e234bd3d29cb27616>  commit 26e4741f77fb5a51daf4f54e234bd3d29cb27616 Author:     Ionen Wolkens <ionen@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2022-09-05 06:55:15 +0000 Commit:     Ionen Wolkens <ionen@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2022-09-05 06:58:36 +0000      x11-terms/kitty: add 0.26.2          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/868543>     Signed-off-by: Ionen Wolkens <ionen@gentoo.org>   x11-terms/kitty/Manifest            |   2 +  x11-terms/kitty/kitty-0.26.2.ebuild | 131 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  2 files changed, 133 insertions(+) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Ionen Wolkens   gentoo-dev  2022-09-05 07:07:11 UTC  ``` Will stable+cleanup in ~3-4 days if no issues, was already looking to stable 0.26.x soon'ish, so will go with this one instead.

They should really indicate that this is a security release (<https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/releases/tag/v0.26.2>), or make the security fix more noticable in the changelog ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Carter Sande    2022-09-05 17:52:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=868543#c3)) > Thanks for reporting!

I'd also be happy to try and request a CVE ID if you think one is warranted here. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-05 17:55:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Carter Sande from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=868543#c4)) > (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=868543#c3)) > > Thanks for reporting!

That should mean the ball is rolling, but they're not very consistent on how quickly they assign CVEs. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Carter Sande    2022-09-23 05:02:11 UTC  ``` MITRE got back to me and said, "Use CVE-2022-41322." ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-23 14:17:41 UTC  ``` Thanks! ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-26 14:03:42 UTC  ``` GLSA request filed ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2022-09-29 14:48:24 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/data/glsa.git/commit/?id=15167f10e54b74097a0bfd3fb525a16a7a528280>  commit 15167f10e54b74097a0bfd3fb525a16a7a528280 Author:     GLSAMaker <glsamaker@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2022-09-29 14:24:10 +0000 Commit:     John Helmert III <ajak@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2022-09-29 14:48:01 +0000      [ GLSA 202209-22 ] Kitty: Arbitrary Code Execution          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/868543>     Signed-off-by: GLSAMaker <glsamaker@gentoo.org>     Signed-off-by: John Helmert III <ajak@gentoo.org>   glsa-202209-22.xml | 42 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  1 file changed, 42 insertions(+) ``` |  |
