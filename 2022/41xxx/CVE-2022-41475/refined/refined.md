- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection on the `/admin/user/doAdd.html` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can add an administrator account to the application without the victim's consent or knowledge.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (or utilizes another form of attacker-controlled content) that, when loaded by a logged-in administrator, submits a form to create a new administrator account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious web page. The attacker needs to know the target application's URL structure and parameters used for user creation.
