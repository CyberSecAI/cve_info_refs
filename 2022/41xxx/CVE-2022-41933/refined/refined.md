{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The password reset functionality in XWiki stored new passwords in plaintext instead of hashing them.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The system was storing passwords in plaintext, which is a major security vulnerability.",
       "The authentication check was performed against the stored plaintext password."
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of user passwords in plaintext in the database, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by using the reset password feature via the 'Forgot your password' link on the login page."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would require access to the database to read the plaintext passwords.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability was present in the password reset feature and only impacted the main wiki users, not the subwiki users. This was due to an unrelated bug related to subwiki users not being able to reset passwords. Additionally, the vulnerability could be particularly dangerous in combination with other vulnerabilities allowing data leaks. The issue has been fixed in versions 14.6RC1, 13.10.8, and 14.4.3, which include a migration to hash passwords and inform users about the possible leak."
