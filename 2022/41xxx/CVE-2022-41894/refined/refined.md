{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The reference kernel of the `CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE` TensorFlow Lite operator incorrectly increments the `data_ptr` when adding the bias to the result.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect pointer arithmetic leading to out-of-bounds write."
    ],
    "impact": "A buffer overflow can occur if the number of input channels is greater than the number of output channels. This allows an attacker to write specific values outside of the bounds of the buffer through the bias of the layer.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafting a specific model with a `CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE` layer where the number of input channels is greater than the number of output channels.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious TensorFlow Lite model. The vulnerability is triggered only when using the reference kernel resolver in the interpreter (`experimental_op_resolver_type=tf.lite.experimental.OpResolverType.BUILTIN_REF`)."
