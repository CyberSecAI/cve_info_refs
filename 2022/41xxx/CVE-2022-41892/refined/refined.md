- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability stems from the possibility to execute unwanted SQL statements through crafted web requests. This indicates an SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements, potentially leading to loss of data confidentiality, data integrity, and availability. Specifically, the impact includes low confidentiality, high integrity, and low availability based on CVSS metrics.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. A malicious actor can send a crafted web request over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability, meaning that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely without prior access or user interaction.
