{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `edited_file` and `content` parameters are not filtered, allowing an attacker to write files across directories.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path traversal",
    "Unrestricted file upload/write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution due to the ability to write arbitrary files to the server's file system, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones with malicious content.",
   "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `edited_file` parameter in the request to include path traversal sequences (`../`) and submitting the request, along with the file content to be written, an attacker can write arbitrary files outside of the intended directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the server with POST parameters such as `edited_file` and `content`."
