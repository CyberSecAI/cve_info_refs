- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sensitive information may be disclosed if an attacker has physical access to system memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information in system memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of sensitive information to an attacker who has physical access to system memory.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the system's memory is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker must have physical access to the system.
