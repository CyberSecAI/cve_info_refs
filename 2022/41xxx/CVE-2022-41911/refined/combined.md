This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Resolve a sanitizer issue with invalid char -> bool conversion.

```
When printing a tensor, we get it's data as a `const char*` array (since that's the underlying storage) and then we typecast it to the element type. However, conversions from `char` to `bool` are undefined if the `char` is not `0` or `1`, so sanitizers/fuzzers will crash.

To fix, we're creating a mutable `char` array to convert the chars to 0/1, according to bool rules.

Discovered via internal fuzzing.

# Invalid char to bool conversion when printing a tensor

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-pf36-r9c6-h97j
Nov 18, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.11.0

## Patched versions

2.8.4, 2.9.3, 2.10.1, 2.11.0

## Description

### Impact

When [printing a tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/807cae8a807960fd7ac2313cde73a11fc15e7942/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.cc#L1200-L1227), we get it's data as a `const char*` array (since that's the underlying storage) and then we typecast it to the element type. However, conversions from `char` to `bool` are undefined if the `char` is not `0` or `1`, so sanitizers/fuzzers will crash.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1be743703279782a357adbf9b77dcb994fe8b508](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1be743703279782a357adbf9b77dcb994fe8b508).
