Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the calculation of the framebuffer size within the `mallocFrameBufferHandler` function in the VNC module (`modules/access/vnc.c`).
*   The calculation `i_width * i_height * i_depth / 8` can overflow the integer used to store `i_framebuffersize`. This leads to a smaller than expected buffer allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:**  The multiplication of `i_width`, `i_height`, and `i_depth` (divided by 8) can result in an integer overflow leading to a truncated value.
*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:**  Due to the incorrect buffer size, writing to the framebuffer using updates from the VNC server can overflow the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The buffer overflow can cause a crash of VLC.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A skilled attacker can leverage the write-what-where primitive to execute arbitrary code by overwriting parts of memory. However, this is considered difficult due to ASLR, DEP, and PIE.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious VNC Server:** An attacker controlling a VNC server can manipulate the `i_width`, `i_height`, and `i_depth` values to trigger the integer overflow and cause a heap buffer overflow.
*  **VNC URI:**  A user must open a crafted VNC URI (`vnc://ip_address_of_server:port/`) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Control over a VNC Server:** The attacker needs to have control over a VNC server that is connected to by a vulnerable VLC client.
*   **Ability to manipulate VNC parameters:** The attacker needs to be able to control the VNC server's parameters such as width, height and depth to cause the integer overflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow.
*  **User Interaction:**  The user needs to be tricked to open the malicious VNC stream in VLC.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is in VLC's code and not the third-party library it uses (libvncClient).
* The `block_alloc` function has a size check, limiting allocations to less than 2^27 bytes, which influences the values chosen for exploitation.
* The vulnerability was patched by adding an explicit `mul_overflow` check to ensure that the multiplication does not cause integer overflow, also asserting that the width, height and bits per pixel are within the expected ranges.
