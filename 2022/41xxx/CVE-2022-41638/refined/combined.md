I went thru all free pop-up plugins out there and everyone of them was really bad – hard to configure, not responsive or just ugly. Pop-up CC is easy to setup and looks awesome. Premium version has more options, but free is still very good – you can use all the templates etc.
I had and issue tho with plugin not sending notifications about new subscribers so wrote about it to the creators and they responded very fast, helping me fix it. It works as intended now.
Thanks!

Great plugin design and functionality. I had some difficulty setting it up – based on a lack of developer knowledge, but their support team were fantastic and responded to my query within hours. They went above ad beyond to get me set up and now I’m on my way there’s no looking back. Can’t recommend highly enough – keep up the great work.

# Risks

CVSS 5.4

##### 5.4

### Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

This could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into your website which will be executed when guests visit your site.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

![Alert](https://patchstack.com/database/img/alert-triangle.svg)
### This software is likely abandoned!

This software was last updated over a year ago and will likely not receive further updates or fixes. Urgently consider replacing the software with an alternative.

### Remove and replace software.

This software was last updated over a year ago and will likely not receive further updates or fixes. Note that deactivating the software does not remove the security threat unless a vPatch is deployed.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
