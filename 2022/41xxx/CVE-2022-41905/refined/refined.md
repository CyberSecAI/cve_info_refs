The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data before it is rendered in the directory browser interface. Specifically, the `add_link_html` and `trailer` variables in the HTML template were not being escaped leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient output sanitization in the directory browser functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the directory browser interface. This could lead to various attacks, such as:
    - Stealing user cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the directory browser page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by displaying untrusted data within the directory browser's user interface such as realm or username. It is not triggered by uploading files with manipulated names.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control data displayed in the directory browser UI (e.g. through a manipulated realm or username).
- The attacker relies on a user browsing the affected directory to trigger the XSS.
