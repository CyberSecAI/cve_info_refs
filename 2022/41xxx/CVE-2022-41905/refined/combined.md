# Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in wsgidav when directory browsing is enabled

High

[mar10](/mar10)
published
GHSA-xx6g-jj35-pxjv
Nov 11, 2022

## Package

pip

wsgidav
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=3.0.0a1,<4.1.0

## Patched versions

4.1.0

## Description

### Impact

Implementations using this library with directory browsing enabled may be susceptible to [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) attacks.

### Patches

Users can upgrade to v4.1.0

### Workarounds

Set `dir_browser.enable = False` in the configuration. For instance, when using a Python dictionary to configure the library:

```
config = {
    # your normal configuration
    "dir_browser": {
      "enable": False
    },
}
app = WsgiDAVApp(config)

```
### For more information

Note that an attacker cannot exploit this vulnerability, by simply uploading a file or folder with a manipulated file name.

However if the WsgiDAV library is used in a scenario where untrusted data is displayed in the directory browser's user interface (e.g. 'realm' or user name, ...) XSS may happen.

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [mar10/wsgidav](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav/)
* See the [security policy](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav/security/policy)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
