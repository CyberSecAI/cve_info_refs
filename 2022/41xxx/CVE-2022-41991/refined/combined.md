# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1639

## Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD m2m DELETE\_FILE cmd heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-41991

##### SUMMARY

A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the m2m DELETE\_FILE cmd functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network request can lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

##### PRODUCT URLS

QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-122 - Heap-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

The Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD is an industrial router with several functionalities and services, such as: SSH, UPNP, VPN, SNMP and many others.

The QUARTZ-GOLD offers a feature called `M2M`. When enabled, the device will execute the `m2m` binary and offer different network services. One of the services the `m2m` binary offers handles several commands. To communicate with this service the client must send a specific UDP packet format.

Following is the portion of `m2m` binary that manages the `DELETE_FILE` command:

```
[...]
cmdid_provided_LB = UDP_data_buff.cmd_id >> 8;
if (cmdid_provided == 0x15) {
  syslog(5,"M2M Command(%02x) DELETE_FILE!!!",0x15);
  m2m_UDP_packet_resp.cmd_id._0_1_ = 0x80;
  m2m_UDP_packet_resp.cmd_id._1_1_ = cmdid_provided_LB;
  [... set base_folder variable ...]
  base_folder_length = strlen(base_folder);
  for (current_entry_off = 0; current_entry_off < (actual_data_len_recv - 0x22);
      current_entry_off = current_entry_off + __bswap_16(previous_data_len)){
    current_data_len = __bswap_16(*(UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data_len + current_entry_off));
    if ((( __bswap_16(*(UDP_data_buff.fix_word + data_idx)) != 0x12)) ||
        (((actual_data_len_recv - 0x22) - current_entry_off) < current_data_len) ||
        (command_string = calloc(current_data_len + base_folder_length + 0xc,1),
        command_string == 0x0)) {                                                                               [1]
      [... invalid state ...]
    }
    sprintf(command_string,"rm -rf %s/%s &",base_folder,&UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data + current_entry_off
           );                                                                                                   [2]
    syslog(6,"Deleting file :%s",command_string + 7);
    system(command_string);
    free(command_string);
    previous_data_len = *(UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data_len + current_entry_off);                               [3]
    [...]

```

Following whe will briefly explain the packet composition for this command:

```
struct M2M_data_entry{
        uint16_t fix_word;
        uint16_t data_len;
        char data[];
};

struct M2M_packet{
        uint16_t packet_len;
        uint16_t cmd_id;
        uint32_t pkd_id;
        uint16_t version;
        M2M_data_entry entries[];
};

```

The UDP packet received, which can contain at most 0x251c bytes, is casted to an `M2M_packet`. This is a variable length structure. Indeed, inside of it there is an array of `M2M_data_entry` structure that is a variable length struct. To seek the various entries the variable `current_entry_off` is used. It starts with value 0 and then, at `[4]`, the value `M2M_data_entry.data_len` of the just-parsed entry is added to seek, in the next loop, the next entry.

The `DELETE_FILE` command will execute the command `rm -rf <base_folder>/<M2M_data_entry.data> &` for each entry in the UDP `M2M_packet` packet it received.

At `[1]` several checks are performed. One related to the entry size is particular interesting: `(((actual_data_len_recv - 0x22) - current_entry_off) < current_data_len)` where `actual_data_len_recv` is the total size of the UDP packet that the service received, and `current_data_len` is the current data entry length. Basically, this checks if the total size of the received packet minus the header (0x22 bytes) minus the `current_entry_off` is lower than the `current_data_len`. If true, the packet is invalid; otherwise a string is allocated.

The string is allocated as follow: `calloc(current_data_len + base_folder_length + 0xc,1)`. It takes into account the `base_folder` length, the `M2M_data_entry.data_len` length of the current entry and the other characters in the format string.

The execution will reach `[2]` and compose the command that will then be executed. The problem is that the allocation takes into account the size provided, but then the composition of the string will use the string until the first null byte. So if the provided size is lower than the actual `M2M_data_entry.data` string size, a heap-based buffer overflow would occur.

if (cmdid_provided == 0x15) {
  syslog(5,"M2M Command(%02x) DELETE_FILE!!!",0x15);
  m2m_UDP_packet_resp.cmd_id._0_1_ = 0x80;
  m2m_UDP_packet_resp.cmd_id._1_1_ = cmdid_provided_LB;
  [... set base_folder variable ...]
  base_folder_length = strlen(base_folder);
  for (current_entry_off = 0; current_entry_off < (actual_data_len_recv - 0x22);
      current_entry_off = current_entry_off + __bswap_16(previous_data_len)){
    current_data_len = __bswap_16(*(UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data_len + current_entry_off));
    if ((( __bswap_16(*(UDP_data_buff.fix_word + data_idx)) != 0x12)) ||
        (((actual_data_len_recv - 0x22) - current_entry_off) < current_data_len) ||
        (command_string = calloc(current_data_len + base_folder_length + 0xc,1),
        command_string == 0x0)) {                                                                               [1]
      [... invalid state ...]
    }
    sprintf(command_string,"rm -rf %s/%s &",base_folder,&UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data + current_entry_off
           );                                                                                                   [2]
    syslog(6,"Deleting file :%s",command_string + 7);
    system(command_string);
    free(command_string);
    previous_data_len = *(UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data_len + current_entry_off);                               [3]
    [...]

```

Following whe will briefly explain the packet composition for this command:

```
struct M2M_data_entry{
        uint16_t fix_word;
        uint16_t data_len;
        char data[];
};

struct M2M_packet{
        uint16_t packet_len;
        uint16_t cmd_id;
        uint32_t pkd_id;
        uint16_t version;
        M2M_data_entry entries[];
};

```

The UDP packet received, which can contain at most 0x251c bytes, is casted to an `M2M_packet`. This is a variable length structure. Indeed, inside of it there is an array of `M2M_data_entry` structure that is a variable length struct. To seek the various entries the variable `current_entry_off` is used. It starts with value 0 and then, at `[4]`, the value `M2M_data_entry.data_len` of the just-parsed entry is added to seek, in the next loop, the next entry.

The `DELETE_FILE` command will execute the command `rm -rf <base_folder>/<M2M_data_entry.data> &` for each entry in the UDP `M2M_packet` packet it received.

At `[1]` several checks are performed. One related to the entry size is particular interesting: `(((actual_data_len_recv - 0x22) - current_entry_off) < current_data_len)` where `actual_data_len_recv` is the total size of the UDP packet that the service received, and `current_data_len` is the current data entry length. Basically, this checks if the total size of the received packet minus the header (0x22 bytes) minus the `current_entry_off` is lower than the `current_data_len`. If true, the packet is invalid; otherwise a string is allocated.

The string is allocated as follow: `calloc(current_data_len + base_folder_length + 0xc,1)`. It takes into account the `base_folder` length, the `M2M_data_entry.data_len` length of the current entry and the other characters in the format string.

The execution will reach `[2]` and compose the command that will then be executed. The problem is that the allocation takes into account the size provided, but then the composition of the string will use the string until the first null byte. So if the provided size is lower than the actual `M2M_data_entry.data` string size, a heap-based buffer overflow would occur.
