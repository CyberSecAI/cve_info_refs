- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress 3D Tag Cloud plugin, versions 3.8 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into submitting it, for example, by embedding it into an email or a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site that performs the unwanted actions on the target site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target site.
