Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-41765:

**Root Cause:**

The `HTMLUserTextField` in MediaWiki did not properly handle hidden users. When a user input a hidden username into the `HTMLUserTextField`, the system would validate it, revealing the existence of the hidden user even if the current user lacked permission to view them.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

- **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak. The `HTMLUserTextField`  exposed the existence of hidden users to unauthorized users. This was because the field was accepting the name of hidden users and confirming that they existed, despite the user not having permissions to view them otherwise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could enumerate hidden user accounts by simply trying usernames in the `HTMLUserTextField` field. This information could then be used for other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A user would need to interact with a form using `HTMLUserTextField`. The attacker simply needs to input the username of a potentially hidden user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a user with access to a form utilizing the `HTMLUserTextField` component. No special privileges are necessary to exploit this vulnerability beyond having an account on the platform.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was identified on Miraheze, which uses CentralAuth.
- Patches were created to address this by treating hidden users as unregistered if the current user can't view them, consistent with other pages like Special:Contribs.
- The fix was implemented by adding a check for `$user->getBlock()->getHideName()` within the conditional block of the `HTMLUserTextField` class.
- The vulnerability was fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.35.8, 1.37.5, 1.38.3, and 1.39.0.
- The vulnerability can be tested on `Special:EmailUser`.
- The patches are available on gerrit.wikimedia.org, linked in the report.
