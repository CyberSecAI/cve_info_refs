Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

The GitHub issue #772 reports three distinct vulnerabilities discovered through fuzzing:

*   **Bug 1: Memory Leaks in `mp4split`**
    *   **Root cause:** Memory leaks occur during the processing of MP4 files. Specifically, when parsing atoms within the file structure, memory is allocated but not properly freed. The issue seems to manifest when processing files where no video track is found.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper memory management, specifically failing to deallocate memory after usage.
    *   **Impact:** The primary impact is memory exhaustion which could lead to application instability or crashes, especially when processing many files or large files.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Processing maliciously crafted MP4 files.
    * **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MP4 file as input.
*   **Bug 2: SEGV in `mp4decrypt`**
    *   **Root cause:** A segmentation fault (SEGV) occurs during the `AP4_Processor::ProcessFragments` function, due to a read memory access on an unknown address (0x000000000028), which hints at dereferencing a null or invalid pointer.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Null or invalid pointer dereference.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Processing maliciously crafted MP4 files.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MP4 file as input.
*   **Bug 3: Memory Leaks in `mp4mux`**
    *   **Root cause:** A memory leak occurs in the `AP4_AvcFrameParser::Feed` function, indicating a problem with memory management when processing AVC (H.264) video frames.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper memory management, specifically failing to deallocate memory after usage.
    *   **Impact:** The primary impact is memory exhaustion which could lead to application instability or crashes, especially when processing many files or large files.
   *  **Attack Vectors:** Processing maliciously crafted MP4 files.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MP4 file as input.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities were found in the `Bento4` library.
*   The reporter provided proof-of-concept (POC) files for each of the bugs.
*   The issues were identified through fuzzing.
*   The environment used for testing was Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS with clang 12.0.1.
*   The memory leaks were detected using AddressSanitizer.

**Mitigation**

* A fix for bug 3 was merged in commit `3934616` which includes the fix from the pull request `876`
