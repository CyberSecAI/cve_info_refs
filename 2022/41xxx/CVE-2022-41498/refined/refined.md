Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `editbrand.php` file of the Billing System Project v1.0 by mayuri\_k. This occurs because the `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter of the `/phpinventory/editbrand.php` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to retrieve sensitive information, including the database name. The provided payload demonstrates that an attacker can use `UNION SELECT` to extract database information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to `/phpinventory/editbrand.php` with a maliciously crafted `id` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter to include SQL injection payloads such as `-1' union select 1,database(),3,4--+`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic web knowledge, including how to craft HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters to perform the injection.
*  **No Authentication:** The vulnerability is directly exploitable without requiring prior authentication.
