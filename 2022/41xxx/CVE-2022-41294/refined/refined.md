- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration in the bot API of IBM Robotic Process Automation. This allows requests from different origins, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper CORS configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions via the bot API by sending malicious requests from a different origin. This may include gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulating the application's functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through network requests originating from a different domain than the vulnerable application. An attacker would send requests to the vulnerable bot API endpoint from a malicious website or application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server from a different origin.
