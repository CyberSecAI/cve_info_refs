    "id": "CVE-2022-41413",
    "Description": "A partial blind CSRF vulnerability exists in perfSONAR v4.x <= v4.4.5 within the /perfsonar-graphs/ test results page. Parameters and values can be injected/passed via the URL parameter, forcing the client to connect unknowingly in the background to other sites via transparent XMLHTTPRequests. This partial blind CSRF bypasses the built-in whitelisting function in perfSONAR.\n\nThis vulnerability was patched in perfSONAR v4.4.6.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the perfSONAR application's inadequate handling of URL parameters on the `/perfsonar-graphs/` page, combined with a flawed implementation of whitelisting, which allows for a partial blind CSRF attack. Specifically, the application uses a Jquery module to make background HTTP requests to a URL specified in the `url` parameter. Even with whitelisting enabled, the application does not properly validate the provided URL and allows requests to arbitrary hosts, bypassing the intended security mechanism. Additionally, URL encoded parameters can be injected into the `dest` parameter and passed to the XMLHttpRequests, allowing for further manipulation of the background request.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
        "Insufficient Input Validation",
        "Bypass of Whitelist Mechanism"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can force a client's browser to make transparent background requests to arbitrary URLs. This could lead to:\n\n- Client browsers unknowingly connecting to attacker-controlled sites.\n- Injection of arbitrary parameters in GET requests to other sites, potentially performing unauthorized actions on vulnerable sites.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that a victim visits, either by clicking a malicious link or through other means of injecting the crafted URL into a victim's browser session. The `url` and `dest` parameters in the URL are used to specify the target and inject additional parameters.",
        "An attacker can exploit this via a user clicking on a crafted link or via an injection in a webpage."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft and distribute malicious URLs. This can be done in various ways, such as:\n\n- Social engineering to trick victims into clicking a malicious link.\n- Injecting the crafted URL into a web page visited by the target." ,
      "attacker_position": "The attacker can be located anywhere and does not require specific network access."

It includes examples of how an attacker can make a client's browser connect to arbitrary URLs and inject parameters into the requests.",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way perfSONAR handles URLs in the `perfsonar-graphs` page, particularly the usage of a Jquery module that makes background requests to URLs specified via a parameter. Despite having a whitelist feature, the application fails to properly validate provided URLs before processing, allowing the client to connect to arbitrary hosts.",

          "The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted URL with parameters like source, dest and url. For instance, `http://192.168.68.145/perfsonar-graphs/?source=1&dest=2&url=https://www.google.com` will make a client's browser connect to Google in the background.",
