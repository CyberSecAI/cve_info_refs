#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Log in as a simple user with just edit rights on the user profile
2. Go to the user's profile
3. Upload an attachment in the attachment tab at the bottom of the page (any image is fine).
4. Click on "rename" in the attachment list and enter
   ```
   {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}.png

   ```

   as new attachment name and submit the rename.
5. Go back to the user profile.
6. Click on the edit icon on the user avatar

**Expected result**:

The attachment with name

```
{{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}.png

```

is displayed and can be selected as user profile.

**Actual result**:

The attachment name is displayed as Hello from groovy!.png. The attachment also cannot be selected, selecting it gives a server error.

This demonstrates a privilege escalation to programming rights from simple user rights. The actual issue is in the attachment selector macro. The macro is also vulnerable to attacks via macro parameters which probably also allow injection of code that is executed with programming rights with just view rights similar to the attack shown in [~~XWIKI-19752~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19752 "Privilege escalation (PR) from view rights through the mentions macro"). The affects version is the version I've used to reproduce the issue but earlier versions might vulnerable, too. It may be difficult to generate a file with a vulnerable name, though, as it is not a valid filename.

# Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in AttachmentSelector.xml

Critical

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-attachment-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0-milestone-1

## Patched versions

14.4.2, 13.10.7, 14.5

## Description

### Impact

Any user with the right to edit his personal page can follow one of the scenario below:

**Scenario 1**:

* Log in as a simple user with just edit rights on the user profile
* Go to the user's profile
* Upload an attachment in the attachment tab at the bottom of the page (any image is fine)
* Click on "rename" in the attachment list and enter `{{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}.png` as new attachment name and submit the rename
* Go back to the user profile
* Click on the edit icon on the user avatar
* `Hello from groovy!` is displayed as the title of the attachment

**Scenario 2**:

* Log in as a simple user with just edit rights on a page
* Create a Page `MyPage.WebHome`
* Create an XClass field of type String named `avatar`
* Add an XObject of type `MyPage.WebHome` on the page
* Insert an `attachmentSelector` macro in the document with the following values:
  + **classname**: `MyPage.WebHome`
  + **property**: `avatar`
  + **savemode**: `direct`
  + **displayImage**: `true`
  + **width**: `]] {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}`. You'll find below a snippet of an `attachmentSelector` macro declaration.
* Display the page
* Use the attachment picker to select an image
* `Hello from groovy` is displayed aside the image

Example of an `attachmentSelector` macro declaration:

```
`{{attachmentSelector classname="MyPage.WebHome" property="avatar" savemode="direct" displayImage="true" width="]] {{async async=~"true~" cached=~"false~" context=~"doc.reference~"~}~}{{groovy~}~}println(~"Hello from groovy!~"){{/groovy~}~}{{/async~}~}"/}}`

```

**Note**: The issue can also be reproduced by inserting the dangerous payload in the `height` or `alt` macro properties.

### Patches

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
