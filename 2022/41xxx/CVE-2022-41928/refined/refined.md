Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code within the `AttachmentSelector.xml` component. Specifically, the `attachmentSelector` macro allows for the injection of arbitrary code via macro parameters such as `width`, `height`, or `alt`. This code is then executed with programming rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Eval Injection (CWE-95):** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled input within the `attachmentSelector` macro parameters. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code using XWiki scripting (Groovy in this case).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with only edit rights on a user profile or a page can inject code that executes with programming rights, effectively escalating their privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code with programming rights on the XWiki server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction:** Attackers can modify or delete sensitive data stored within XWiki.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Exploitation could potentially lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Attachment Renaming:** An attacker can upload an attachment to their user profile, then rename the attachment to include the malicious payload.
*   **Macro Injection:** An attacker can create a page with an XClass and then inject a malicious `attachmentSelector` macro with the payload in its parameters.
*  The vulnerability can also be triggered by inserting the malicious payload in the `height` or `alt` macro properties

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account with edit rights on a user profile or a page.
*   **Basic XWiki Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to upload attachments, rename attachments, and use macros to inject the payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-attachment-ui` component.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in XWiki versions 14.4.2, 13.10.7 and 14.5.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a critical severity with a CVSS score of 10.0.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions >= 5.0-milestone-1
*   The issue affects not just the filename but macro parameters such as `width`, `height`, or `alt`.
