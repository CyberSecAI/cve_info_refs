- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The BadgeOS plugin for WordPress lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users, such as administrators, to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, would execute an unintended action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action that triggers the malicious request.
