- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Serialization/deserialization mismatch in system tools.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent handling of serialized data, leading to a deserialization vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized startup of components.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation of the serialization/deserialization process within system tools.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have the capability to manipulate or provide the serialized data that is handled by the vulnerable system tools.
