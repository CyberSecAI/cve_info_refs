The provided content relates to CVE-2022-41900.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An input `pooling_ratio` that is smaller than 1 triggers a heap out-of-bounds read in `tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPool` and `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool` operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation for the `pooling_ratio` parameter. The code did not properly check if `pooling_ratio` is greater than or equal to 1.
-Specifically, the issue lies in `tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc` and `tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious actor could potentially cause a heap out-of-bounds read which could lead to a denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `pooling_ratio` argument in the `tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPool` and `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool` functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to control or influence the `pooling_ratio` parameter, which might occur when a user supplies parameters in a machine learning application using Tensorflow.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix is implemented by adding checks to ensure the `pooling_ratio` is greater or equal than 1.
- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.8.4, 2.9.3, 2.10.1, and 2.11.0.
