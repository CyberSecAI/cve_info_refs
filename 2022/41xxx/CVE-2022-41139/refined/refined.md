{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The gist contact configuration field in MITRE CALDERA's debrief plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Improper Input Sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate their privileges within the application and execute arbitrary code on any enrolled systems. Specifically, a 'blue' user can inject malicious code that, when triggered by a 'red' user, can lead to arbitrary command execution on agents.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the gist contact configuration field. A malicious string is stored in this field which is then triggered when a 'red' user accesses the debrief page and hovers the C2 Server icon.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to a 'blue' user account in the CALDERA application to modify the gist contact configuration. The victim is typically a 'red' user who interacts with the debrief page."
