# Invalid memory access in the BLE L2CAP module

Moderate

[nvt](/nvt)
published
GHSA-24xp-g5gf-6vvm
Dec 16, 2022

## Package

ble-l2cap

## Affected versions

<= 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

The Contiki-NG operating system for IoT devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack. An attacker can inject a packet in this stack, which causes the implementation to dereference a NULL pointer and triggers undefined behavior.

More specifically, while processing the L2CAP protocol, the implementation maps an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. In this structure, state information regarding credits is managed through calls to the function input\_l2cap\_credit in the module os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c. Unfortunately, the input\_l2cap\_credit function does not check that the metadata corresponding to the user-supplied channel ID actually exists, which can lead to the channel variable being set to NULL before a pointer dereferencing operation is performed.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request [#2253](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2253)

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-41972
