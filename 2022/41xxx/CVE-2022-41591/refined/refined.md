Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the backup module of Huawei's EMUI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path traversal: This means an attacker can manipulate file paths during backup operations to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to other system files: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass intended file access restrictions and read sensitive system files. This can have a range of impacts including data theft or further exploitation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the backup module of the EMUI system. An attacker would need to craft a malicious backup operation that contains manipulated file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have some level of access or ability to interact with the backup module on the targeted device, in order to trigger the malicious backup operation. This may involve a malicious app, or some other avenue to inject commands to the backup functionality.

**Affected Versions:**
- EMUI 12.0.1
- EMUI 12.0.0
- EMUI 11.0.1

This vulnerability is rated as High severity by Huawei.
