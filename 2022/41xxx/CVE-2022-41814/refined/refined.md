- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Logged-in users can inject arbitrary HTML (XSS) by editing their user preferences.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input in user preferences.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by editing user preferences in the BlueSpice interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user.
