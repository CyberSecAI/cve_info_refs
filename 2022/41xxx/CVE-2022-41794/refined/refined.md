Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-41794

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `PSDInput::load_resource_thumbnail()` function of the OpenImageIO library when processing PSD files.
- Specifically, the `width` field of the thumbnail resource, read directly from the file, is used to calculate an offset during pixel processing in the `get_pixels` function, without any validation against the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code allocates a temporary buffer for a single row of pixels based on the `output_width` from libjpeg-turbo. The size of this buffer is not validated against the width specified in the PSD file, which is also used to calculate the write offset when copying decompressed pixel data. This leads to a buffer overflow if the `width` from the file is larger than the width from the jpeg.
- **Lack of input validation:** The `width` field read from the PSD file is not validated against the allocated buffer size.
- The vulnerability is in the processing of PSD thumbnail resources, specifically resource IDs 1033 and 1036, which both call `load_resource_thumbnail`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By crafting a malicious PSD file, an attacker can overwrite heap memory by providing a large width in the resource metadata, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Application crash:** The provided crash information indicates that a heap-buffer-overflow leads to an application crash, confirming a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious file:** An attacker provides a specially crafted PSD file containing a malicious thumbnail resource.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the OpenImageIO library attempts to process the thumbnail data of the malicious PSD file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PSD file, so the vulnerable software can process it. This could be achieved via a file upload or by convincing a user to open a crafted file.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, as the code is executed within the context of the user running the application processing the file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of OpenImageIO up to and including 2.3.19.0.
- The vulnerability is present in the `PSDInput::load_resource_thumbnail` function, specifically when processing resource IDs 1033 and 1036.
- The crash information confirms a heap-buffer-overflow with a write of size 1 at an address outside of allocated memory in the `get_pixels_` function.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 9.8.
- Patches have been released to fix the vulnerability.
