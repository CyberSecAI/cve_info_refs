  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability in `crypto/tls` allows a malicious actor to cause panics in both TLS clients and servers by sending large TLS handshake records, leading to a denial of service.",
    "details": "The vulnerability arises from the possibility of sending large TLS handshake records that cause servers and clients to panic when they attempt to construct responses. This affects TLS 1.3 clients, TLS 1.2 clients using session resumption (Config.ClientSessionCache), and TLS 1.3 servers requesting client certificates (Config.ClientAuth >= RequestClientCert).",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper handling of excessively large TLS handshake records, which can lead to panics during response construction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of large TLS handshake records.",
      "Lack of checks/limits on the size of handshake records during processing."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) due to panics in TLS clients and servers.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack, attacker sends large, malicious TLS handshake records to the target server or client."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a vulnerable TLS client or server. No specific privileges are required.",
