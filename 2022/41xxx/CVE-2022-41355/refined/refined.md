Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/leave_system/classes/Master.php?f=delete_department` file, specifically with the `id` parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the `updatexml` function to extract sensitive database information, including the database name and potentially other data.
*   **Potential for Data Manipulation/Deletion:** While the example focuses on information disclosure, SQL injection can potentially be used to modify or delete data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the request is manipulated to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable endpoint `/leave_system/classes/Master.php?f=delete_department`.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests and craft SQL injection payloads.

**Payload:**

*   The provided payload `id=3' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+` is designed to extract the database name.
*   The `updatexml` function is used with `concat` to embed the result of `select database()` within the XML.
*   The `'` character closes the existing query, then adds a condition that is always true, and `--+` comments out the rest of the original query.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable application is identified as "Online Leave Management System v1.0 by oretnom23."
*   The exploit was tested with XAMPP-PHP 8.1.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a table in the database
