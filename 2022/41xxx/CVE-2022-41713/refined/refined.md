Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `deep-object-diff` library's improper handling of incoming JSON keys. Specifically, the library does not validate or sanitize the keys, allowing an attacker to inject and modify the `__proto__` property of objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution, where an attacker can modify the prototype of an object by manipulating the `__proto__` property. This allows modification of properties of all objects inheriting from that prototype.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The library fails to validate or sanitize input keys, thus, it does not prevent modification of the `__proto__` property.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Property Modification:** By manipulating the `__proto__` property, an attacker can add or modify properties of objects.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** As demonstrated in the provided code example, an attacker can potentially alter an object property that controls access to administrative actions.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can potentially modify the application's behavior, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a malicious JSON payload to an application using the `deep-object-diff` library.
*   **JSON Input Manipulation:** The attack vector involves injecting `__proto__` properties into the JSON input used with `deep-object-diff` methods like `addedDiff`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control JSON input:** The attacker needs to be able to control the JSON input that is processed by the vulnerable library.
*   **No special privileges needed:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

The provided content contains a detailed explanation of prototype pollution along with an example of how to exploit it using `deep-object-diff`. The code example clearly demonstrates how an attacker can modify the `role` property via `__proto__` injection, leading to unauthorized admin rights. The vulnerability was discovered by Carlos Bello from Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.  The timeline shows that the vendor was contacted and a patch was issued, and public disclosure happened on 2022-11-15.
