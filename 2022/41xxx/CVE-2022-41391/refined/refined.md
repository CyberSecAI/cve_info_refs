{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize the 'cod' parameter in the HTTP GET request, allowing for SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data from the database. The provided example uses sleep(40), which shows that an attacker can cause delays in the server response, this could lead to denial of service",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to various endpoints of the OcoMon application, specifically targeting the 'cod' parameter. Vulnerable endpoints include `download.php`, `showImg.php` and other 36 endpoints.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the attack. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OcoMon application."
