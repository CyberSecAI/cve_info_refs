Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from inadequate authentication in the "Command Center" web interface of Kyocera Document Solutions MFPs and printers. Specifically, it is related to missing authorization, which allows an attacker to bypass login authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing authorization (CWE-425):** The system fails to properly verify the user's identity before allowing modifications to the product's settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A network-adjacent attacker can modify the product settings without needing to authenticate.
- This could lead to unauthorized changes to device configurations, potentially disrupting operations or compromising security.
- The attacker can change settings to unintended values, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-adjacent access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable printer/MFP.
- **CGI exploitation:** The attacker uses CGI (Common Gateway Interface) to send requests to the device.
- **Bypassing login:** The attacker avoids the login authentication mechanism of Command Center.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be located on the same network as the targeted printer/MFP.
- The attacker needs the capability to send crafted CGI requests to the device's Command Center web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in a wide range of Kyocera Document Solutions' MFPs and printers.
- The provided information indicates that this vulnerability is not expected to have any impact unless it is introduced into the customer's network from the outside and recommends using firewalls and private IP addresses as mitigating controls
- The vendor recommends updating the firmware to the latest version and contacting their local distributor for information on changing the firmware.
- The vulnerability is described as "Inadequate Authentication of Command Center" in the Kyocera advisory.
- The vulnerability was reported by Takayuki Sasaki, Takaya Noma and Katsunari Yoshioka of Yokohama National University.
