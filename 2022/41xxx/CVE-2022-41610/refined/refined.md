Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper authorization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The Intel速 EMA Configuration Tool (before version 1.0.4) and Intel速 MC (before version 2.4) lack proper authorization controls, allowing an authenticated user to perform actions they should not be permitted to.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated user could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required. The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. User interaction is required
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be a local, authenticated user with the ability to trigger the vulnerability through the application's interface.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is due to inadequate authorization checks in the Intel速 EMA Configuration Tool and Intel速 MC software. This allows a local, authenticated user to perform unauthorized actions potentially causing a denial of service.
