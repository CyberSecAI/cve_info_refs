Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `fastest-json-copy` library not properly validating incoming JSON keys during the copy process. Specifically, it allows the `__proto__` property to be modified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution. By injecting a `__proto__` property into a JSON object, an attacker can modify the prototype of objects, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can edit or add new properties to an object by modifying its prototype.
- In the provided example, this allows for privilege escalation, where a normal user can be given "admin" role by modifying the object's prototype through the `__proto__` property.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the JSON input of the `copy` function of the library. An attacker crafts a JSON string containing the `__proto__` property with the desired modifications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the JSON data passed to the `fastest-json-copy` library.
- The attacker can be an external user sending malicious data, which can modify the application's objects if the application uses this library to copy/clone the JSON data.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0.1 of the `fastest-json-copy` library.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- A proof of concept (exploit.js) and an exploitation example are provided demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
- There is currently no patch available for this vulnerability in the provided content.
