Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-41956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `submit` parameter in the Autolab's remote handin feature. This parameter, intended to specify the path of a submitted file, is directly used to access files without proper verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing an attacker to use ".." sequences in the `submit` parameter to navigate to directories outside the intended submission directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the path traversal vulnerability to access and view the contents of arbitrary files on the Autolab server that are accessible to the Autolab instance's user. This could include sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out through HTTP requests.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the Autolab server.
*   **Knowledge of a valid user email:** The attacker needs to know at least one email address of a registered user on the platform, as this is used as a parameter in the URL.
*   **Knowledge of course and assessment names:** The attacker needs to know the course name and assessment name to be able to construct the URL.
*   **Knowledge of path on the server:** The attacker must know or guess the path to the file they wish to access.
*   **Remote Handin enabled:** The remote handin feature must be enabled.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `app/controllers/assessment/handin.rb`, specifically in the `submit` parameter, passed to the `saveHandin` method.
*   The vulnerability is triggered via a GET request to the `/courses/<course-name>/assessments/<assessment-name>/local_submit` endpoint, with the `user` and `submit` parameters.
*   The `submit` parameter takes a file path, which, if manipulated using directory traversal sequences like `../`, allows access to arbitrary files on the server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Peter St√∂ckli from the GitHub Security Lab.
*   The vulnerability was patched in Autolab version 2.10.0.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory).
*   The CVSS v3 score is 6.5, with a base score of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
*   The StackHawk article on Rails path traversal provides general context about path traversal vulnerabilities and prevention techniques in Rails applications.
