Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41248:

**CVE-2022-41248**

*   **Vulnerability:**  API key stored in plain text and not masked
*   **Root Cause:** The BigPanda Notifier Plugin stores the BigPanda API key unencrypted in the `BigpandaGlobalNotifier.xml` configuration file on the Jenkins controller. Additionally, the global configuration form does not mask the API key.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Insecure Storage:** The API key is stored in plain text in a configuration file.
    *   **Lack of Masking:** The API key is not masked in the global configuration form, making it easily visible.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Users with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the unencrypted API key.
    *   Attackers may be able to observe and capture the API key from the configuration form, leading to unauthorized access to BigPanda.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Access to the Jenkins controller file system.
    *   Observation of the global configuration form by an attacker.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller's file system or the Jenkins web interface to view the plugin configuration.
    *   The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read permission (to see the form and the API key) or access to the Jenkins controller filesystem.

**Additional Information:**

*   The BigPanda Notifier Plugin version 1.4.0 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   There is no fix available as of the publication of the advisory.
*   This vulnerability is classified as low severity.
*  This CVE is related to the masking part of the vulnerability, with the other part being covered under CVE-2022-41247.
