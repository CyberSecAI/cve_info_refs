Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-41950

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `super-xray` application incorrectly setting the permissions of the `xray` executable to `777` (read, write, and execute for all users) using the `chmod` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Default Permissions:** The application uses `chmod 777` on the `xray` binary, which grants excessive permissions to all users.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability allows any user to modify or execute the `xray` binary, which may lead to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can leverage the overly permissive permissions to modify the `xray` binary and potentially gain elevated privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could potentially replace the `xray` binary with malicious code that would execute with the same permissions as the application.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally on systems where the `super-xray` application is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the affected machine where `super-xray` is installed and the `xray` binary is present with the insecure permissions.
- An attacker needs to be able to modify or execute the `xray` binary, which is easily done with 777 permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is confirmed to affect `Linux` and `Mac OS` systems.
- The issue was fixed in version `0.3-beta` of the `super-xray` application.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.4.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-250: Improper Preservation of Permissions.
