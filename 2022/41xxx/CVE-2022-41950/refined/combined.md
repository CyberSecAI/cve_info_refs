[`4a5ecba`](/4ra1n/super-xray/commit/4a5ecbad63b9b2c4be677388236831d771d1dc96)

该版本为**重大更新**

之前强制停止的逻辑并不能真正地停止，使用`kill/taskkill`命令才可以做到，该版本仅在`Mac OS`测试通过，在`Windows`中不确定。开一个新线程循环监听是否强制停止，如果收到消息立即结束

由于某些API限制，必须使用`JRE/JDK 9`以上（已测试11，16，19通过）

Security:

* 修复潜在提权漏洞 [GHSA-2g28-xrw6-fq5f](https://github.com/4ra1n/super-xray/security/advisories/GHSA-2g28-xrw6-fq5f)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
