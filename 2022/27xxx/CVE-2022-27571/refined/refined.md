**SVE-2021-24110(CVE-2022-27568, CVE-2022-27569, CVE-2022-27570, CVE-2022-27571): Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in some parser functions and sheifd\_get\_info\_image function in libsimba library**

Severity: Critical
Affected versions: Q(10), R(11), S(12)
Reported on: December 1, 2021
Disclosure status: Privately disclosed.
Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in some parser functions and sheifd\_get\_info\_image function of libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows code execution by remote attackers.
The patch adds the proper validation of input data.

Based on this, the following can be extracted:

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in the `libsimba` library within multiple parser functions and the `sheifd_get_info_image` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attack via crafted input processed by the vulnerable `libsimba` library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send data that can be processed by the vulnerable library.
