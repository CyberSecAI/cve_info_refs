  "CVE-2022-27651": {
    "description": "The container-tools module contains tools for working with containers, notably podman, buildah, skopeo, and runc.  Security Fix(es):\n\n* buildah: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty (CVE-2022-27651)",
    "root_cause": "A bug was found in Buildah where containers were created with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect default setting of inheritable capabilities for linux containers.",
      "The inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set."
    ],
    "impact": "Programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2).  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker able to execute programs inside the container."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the affected containers is required to exploit this vulnerability. Must be able to execute programs with inheritable file capabilities within the container."
