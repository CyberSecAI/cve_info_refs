- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `unescape` function in `cgi.c` of DD-WRT's httpd component improperly handles URL-encoded strings. It assumes that after a '%' character, there will always be at least two characters representing a hex value. This assumption leads to an out-of-bounds read and write if a '%' is followed by fewer than two characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper input validation: The function does not check for the presence of at least two hex characters after a '%' before attempting to parse them.
    - Out-of-bounds read: When the check fails and the function proceeds, it reads data beyond the allocated buffer.
    - Out-of-bounds write: The function overwrites memory outside the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Memory corruption: An attacker can corrupt memory by crafting a specific HTTP request with a malformed URL-encoded string.
    - The vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated in the report. The report only states that a memory corruption vulnerability exists, and the CVSS score indicates only low impact to integrity.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malformed URL-encoded string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected DD-WRT device. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
