  "CVE-2022-27778": {
    "root_cause": "The curl command-line tool incorrectly removes the original filename when using `--no-clobber` and `--remove-on-error` options together, instead of removing the generated file with the appended number.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrectly resolved file name/reference"
    ],
    "impact": "The tool removes an unexpected file, leading to data loss.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A user needs to use specific command line options together `--no-clobber` with `--remove-on-error`"

  "CVE-2022-27782": {
    "root_cause": "libcurl reuses connections from the connection pool even when TLS or SSH options that should prevent reuse have been changed.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness"

    "impact": "A connection with incorrect TLS/SSH settings can be used for subsequent transfers, potentially leading to information exposure or unauthorized access.",

      "A malicious actor could set different TLS or SSH parameters on subsequent transfers to reuse an existing connection that doesn't fit"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the curl options used during subsequent transfers. The attacker does not need to be in a network position to perform this attack, this is client side."

    "root_cause": "An erroneous function in libcurl with NSS can cause a never-ending busy loop when `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` is used.",

      "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')"
