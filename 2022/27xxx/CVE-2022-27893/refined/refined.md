- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The osisoft-pi-web-connector plugin was logging HTTP request headers, which could capture plaintext usernames and passwords when Basic Authentication was used. This was due to the plugin logging authentication request headers which included credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information through logging. Specifically, logging of HTTP request headers containing plaintext credentials used for Basic Authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Credentials used for authenticating with OSISoft PI Systems were exposed in logs, potentially allowing unauthorized access to OSISoft PI System data if the logs were accessed by malicious actors.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to logs where the authentication headers were captured was limited to authorized Palantir personnel. However, if malicious actors had gained access to those logs, they could extract and use the exposed credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need unauthorized access to the logs generated by the osisoft-pi-web-connector plugin. This would primarily require compromising Palantir's internal systems.
