Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from missing `_JEXEC or die check` statements in multiple files. This check is essential for preventing direct access to certain PHP files. The missing check was introduced due to PSR12 changes in Joomla version 4.2.0.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The absence of the `_JEXEC or die check` allows unauthorized access to these files, leading to Full Path Disclosure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information, specifically the full server path of the affected files. This information can be valuable for reconnaissance and further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves directly accessing the vulnerable PHP files through a web browser, bypassing the intended entry points of the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**Additional Notes**

*   This vulnerability is rated as low severity.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in Joomla! version 4.2.0.
*   The fix is available in version 4.2.1.
