The provided content relates to CVE-2022-27105.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input in two different areas of the inMailX software:

1.  The inMailX notifier, which renders HTML content without proper sanitization.
2.  The name of SharePoint connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the victim's Outlook client. This could allow an attacker to potentially steal credentials, session cookies, or perform actions on behalf of the user, depending on the level of access and privileges of the application within the user's environment.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Email with malicious payload:** An attacker can send an email containing an XSS payload as part of the email body to the victim's Outlook inbox. When the inMailX notifier displays a notification for the received email, the malicious script is executed.
2.  **Malicious connection name:** An attacker (either a regular user or a network administrator) can set the name of a SharePoint connection to include an XSS payload. When a user tries to view the connection details in the Outlook overview list, the malicious script will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **For the first attack vector (Notifier):** The attacker only needs the ability to send an email with a malicious payload to the target.
*   **For the second attack vector (SharePoint connection):** The attacker needs to be able to modify the settings of SharePoint connections, either as a user or an administrator. This could be an internal actor or a compromised account.

**Affected versions:**

* inMailX versions 3.21.0601 up to and including 3.22.0300.

**Mitigation:**
* Upgrade to inMailX version 3.22.0300 or later to remediate the vulnerability.
* Disabling inMailX Notifier feature and SharePoint store will also prevent the attack, but is not a recommended mitigation.
