## Enterprise Email Management, Compliance and Productivity Solution

**inMailX** is an enterprise email management, compliance and productivity solution for Microsoft Outlook and Office 365, which provides the functionality and tools users need to effectively manage their emails and attachments.  inMailX integrates seamlessly with records and document management systems, cloud and network folder structures, helping users improve their email filing compliance.

With inMailX staff can improve their emails and attachments management compliance, productivity and the quality of work, while maintaining focus and reducing operational errors.  inMailX substantially enhances existing Outlook functionality and provides users with the ability to:

- Manage emails and attachments using a simple and efficient interface

  - Compress and secure attachments into ZIP while composing emails

 - Schedule follow-up tasks/appointments when filing or sending emails
  - Reduce repetitive typing and quickly compose standard emails with content manager

Its user interface is simple and intuitive, and it has been designed to combine most common tasks, such as 'Send, File & Print', 'Close, File & Print' or 'Attachments Preview, Clean, PDF, Protect, Rename, Reorder', into simple one-click actions.  Digitus has developed several inMailX modules that can be purchased separately or bundled in two cost effective suites*, inMailX Standard* and *inMailX Professional**.*

## Integration with third party electronic documents and records management systems

When used with its optional connectors for document/records management and file system integration, inMailX enhances Microsoft Outlook capabilities to file emails into third party document/records management systems, such as: iManage Work/Worksite, Micro Focus/HPE Content Manager, NetDocuments, SharePoint, Worldox, WebDAV (Oracle UCM, WebDAV Repositories, etc.), Cloud Stores or Network Folders (Box, Dropbox, GoogleDrive, OneDrive, MYOB Accountants Enterprise, MYOB Insolvency, APS Folders, etc.).

By integrating directly into Microsoft Outlook, inMailX allows staff to take control over managing their emails without losing any of the existing Outlook functionality. To find out more, click [here](/products/inmailx/optional-connectors "Optional Connectors").

## Save time, Reduce costs, Increase productivity

With inMailX, organisations will ensure that their staff are able to maintain their sent and received emails organised, that email attachments can easily be previewed, cleaned, converted to PDF, reanmed and reordered, and that paper wastage is reduced by being able to truncate email printing and selectively print attachments.

In addition, organisations will improve their email branding by being able to centrally deploy and maintain standardised corporate email forms and signatures which are integrated Exchange Global Address List and Active Directory.

Since inMailX is extremely intuitive, it allows users to take advantage of its benefits with minimal training, and without delay. This translates into saving valuable time, reduced running costs, and increased productivity.

|  | CVE-2022-27105 |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | These vulnerabilities are only impacting customers that are licensed to use inMailX Email Manager with SharePoint store. Customers that do not have a license for the inMailX Email Manager Module, or customers that have a license for inMailX Email Manager but disabled the inMailX Notifier feature and SharePoint store, are not impacted by these vulnerabilities, as the inMailX Notifier and SharePoint store are only available for customers being licensed to use inMailX Email Manager and SharePoint Connector. |
|  | InMailX XSS Vulnerability version requirements: |
|  | 3.21.0601 up until 3.22.0300 are affected. Upgrade to 3.22.0300 or above to remediate. |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | The first finding is located in the InMailX notifier with HTML rendering enabled by the user. |
|  | When receiving an email containing a XSS payload like <script>alert(1)</script> the code is executed when the notifier fires a notification to the desktop user. |
|  |  |
|  | The second finding is located in the name of (SharePoint) connections. |
|  | A user can specify this or a network administrator with privileges to distribute the file throughout the AD network. |
|  | Setting the name of for example a SharePoint connection to: <script>alert(1)</script> with any arbitrary URL as target will run the XSS when trying to open the server name in the outlook overview list. |
