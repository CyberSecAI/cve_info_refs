Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-27789:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-After-Free (UAF)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to run malicious code on the victim's system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning an attacker would need some form of local access to the system. User interaction (UI:R) is required for the exploit to occur, meaning the user would likely need to open a malicious file or document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and must trick the user into interacting with a malicious file. The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N).
