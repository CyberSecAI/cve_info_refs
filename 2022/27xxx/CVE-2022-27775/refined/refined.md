{
  "CVE-2022-27775": {
    "Root cause": "libcurl's connection pool logic fails to consider IPv6 address zone IDs when matching connections for reuse.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper matching of connections in the connection pool.",
       "Lack of consideration for IPv6 zone IDs when determining if a connection can be reused."
    ],
    "Impact": "libcurl may reuse the wrong connection when one transfer uses a zone id and a subsequent transfer uses another (or no) zone id, potentially leading to information exposure.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can potentially trigger the vulnerability by sending a request using a local IPv6 address with a zone ID and then sending a subsequent request using a different zone ID or without a zone ID.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to send multiple requests with different IPv6 zone IDs (or without zone IDs) to a server using a vulnerable libcurl version."
  }
