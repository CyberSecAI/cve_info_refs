{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user input in the private chat functionality of BigBlueButton.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript payloads, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript code in their username and sends a private message to the victim, or leaves the room which triggers the notification with the malicious username.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be in the same conference room as the victim to send private messages or trigger the leave notification."
