How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

I have tried various plugins for backup and migration:
The first plugin to backup WP was good at backups, but restoring a site was not very user-friendly and involved a lot of manual steps. Not good for beginners.
Number two was reliable for backups Plus relatively easy to restore, but regarded migration to be a premium feature only available in the paid version.
Another one made Backup and Migration available in the free version, but was not reliable enough and only worked for simple sites.
Number four was reliable and I could Migrate even complex sites flawlessly from online to e.g. LocalWP â but the migration back to the online web space was a premium feature.
WPVivid Backup & Migration appears to be the perfect mix of all these: Reliable backups, easy restore and migration in both directions in the free version. So at the moment Iâm really happy with it.
There also is a very reasonably priced Lifetime License that I might actually buy some day, if the plugin continues to shine in the time to come.
UPDATE 01/2025 Iâm still happy with the plugin and did indeed buy a Freelancer Lifetime License.

I recently started using the WPVividPRO plugin, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The functionality it offers for backups and migrations is top-notch, making it incredibly easy to manage my WordPress site.
The user interface is intuitive, which means I could set up my backups without any hassle. I particularly appreciate the scheduling feature, allowing me to automate the backup process without needing to remember to do it manually.
What truly sets WPVividPRO apart is the support. Whenever I had questions or needed assistance, the support team was prompt and helpful. Itâs reassuring to know that thereâs a dedicated team behind such a reliable tool.
I highly recommend WPVividPRO to anyone looking for a robust backup solution for their WordPress site. Thank you, Tony, for your excellent work!
