Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the changes related to allowing SVG logos in the MISP application:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The commit introduces a new feature to allow organization logos in SVG format. Previously, only PNG was allowed.
- This change is controlled by a configuration setting `'enable_svg_logos'` which is disabled by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The primary potential vulnerability is related to the processing of SVG files. SVG files can contain embedded JavaScript, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.
- The code adds a check on the file extension to ensure it's either 'svg' or 'png'.
- It also checks the setting `enable_svg_logos` to make sure that if it is disabled SVG files are blocked.
- The code does not include sanitization of the SVG file itself, which presents a potential vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- If an attacker uploads a malicious SVG file (containing JavaScript), and `enable_svg_logos` is enabled, they could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser who views the logo.
- This could allow for session hijacking, defacement, phishing, and other XSS-related attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the organization logo upload functionality in the MISP application.
- An attacker would need to have permissions to add/edit an organization logo.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must be an authenticated user with permissions to edit organization settings.
- They need to be able to upload files.
- They must be able to successfully upload a malicious SVG file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code does attempt to prevent SVG uploads if the setting is disabled.
- The code updates the UI to mention SVG as an option for file uploads if the configuration is enabled.
- The lack of SVG sanitization is the primary concern with this feature addition.
- The provided code snippet is related to the functionality added by the commit not a vulnerability in itself.
- The commit adds a config setting `enable_svg_logos`, adds a check in the `OrganisationsController` before uploading, and adds the configuration to Server model.
