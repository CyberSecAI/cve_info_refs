# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty

Low

[haircommander](/haircommander)
published
GHSA-4hj2-r2pm-3hc6
Apr 14, 2022

## Package

CRI-O
(Packaged version)

## Affected versions

all

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

A bug was found in CRI-O where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.

This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.

### Patches

This bug will been fixed in the following versions of CRI-O:

* v1.24.0

Users should update to the version corresponding to their minor release as soon as possible. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.

This fix changes CRI-O behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work. Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container's bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container's bounding set per the rules described in the manual page. In all cases the container's bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.

### Workarounds

The entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.

### Credits

CRI-O would like to thank [Andrew G. Morgan](https://github.com/AndrewGMorgan) for responsibly disclosing this issue, as well as the Moby (Docker Engine) project for working with the other container engines in coordinating a fix.

4.8/Medium

| Metric | Value | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attack Vector (AV) | Local | An attacker requires local control to launch a container with files that have inheritable capabilities. |
| Attack Complexity (AC) | Low | Modifying a file to have inheritable capabilities is not difficult. |
| Privileges Required (PR) | Low | An attacker requires enough privilege to cause a container to be launched with a compromised image. Moby's API is typically bound to a local Unix domain socket and requires calls to be made from a process that is either UID 0 or present in the configured group. |
| User Interaction (UI) | Required | An attacker must cause the compromised image to be run. |
| Scope (S) | Unchanged | The container boundary set by Moby, including the bounding capability set, is not modified. A successful attack gains access to privileges and resources within the boundary, not outside of it. |
| Confidentiality (C) | Low | An attacker may gain access to some confidential information through elevation of CAP\_CHOWN, CAP\_DAC\_OVERRIDE, CAP\_FOWNER, CAP\_SETFCAP, or CAP\_SETPCAP, but the exposed information is limited to that which is already inside the container. |
| Integrity (I) | Low | An attacker may be able to tamper with data inside the container through elevation of CAP\_CHOWN, CAP\_DAC\_OVERRIDE, CAP\_FOWNER, CAP\_SETFCAP, or CAP\_SETPCAP, or spoof packets with CAP\_NET\_RAW, but the tampered data is limited to that which is already inside the container. |
| Availability (A) | Low | An attacker may be able to affect the availability of an application running inside the container through elevation of CAP\_KILL or CAP\_NET\_RAW, or may be able to affect availability through tampering with file dependencies. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2066839#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2022-03-22 15:20:12 UTC  ``` A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.  This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.  Patches This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.  This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. Refer to capabilities(7) for a description of how capabilities work. Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container's bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container's bounding set per the rules described in the manual page. In all cases the container's bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.  Workarounds The entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like capsh(1) to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2066839#c3)  Avinash Hanwate    2022-03-30 12:38:31 UTC  ``` Created cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2070107](show_bug.cgi?id=2070107 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-27652 cri-o: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty [fedora-all]")]   Created cri-o:1.17/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2070112](show_bug.cgi?id=2070112 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-27652 cri-o:1.17/cri-o: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty [fedora-all]")]   Created cri-o:1.18/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2070104](show_bug.cgi?id=2070104 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-27652 cri-o:1.18/cri-o: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty [fedora-all]")]   Created cri-o:1.19/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2070111](show_bug.cgi?id=2070111 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-27652 cri-o:1.19/cri-o: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty [fedora-all]")]   Created cri-o:1.20/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2070105](show_bug.cgi?id=2070105 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-27652 cri-o:1.20/cri-o: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty [fedora-all]")]   Created cri-o:1.21/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2070108](show_bug.cgi?id=2070108 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-27652 cri-o:1.21/cri-o: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty [fedora-all]")]   Created cri-o:1.22/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2070109](show_bug.cgi?id=2070109 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-27652 cri-o:1.22/cri-o: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty [fedora-all]")]   Created cri-o:nightly/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2070110](show_bug.cgi?id=2070110 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-27652 cri-o:nightly/cri-o: Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2066839#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-02 18:21:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10  Via RHSA-2022:1600 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1600](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A1600)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2066839#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-02 22:45:18 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
