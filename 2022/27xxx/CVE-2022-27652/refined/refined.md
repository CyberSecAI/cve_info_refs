  "CVE-2022-27652": {
    "Description": "A bug was found in CRI-O where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.",
    "Root cause": "Containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Containers started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities.",
       "Programs with inheritable file capabilities could elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2)."
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers with access to programs with inheritable file capabilities could elevate those capabilities to the permitted set, potentially gaining access to some confidential information or tampering with data within the container through elevation of specific capabilities (CAP_CHOWN, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, CAP_FOWNER, CAP_SETFCAP, CAP_SETPCAP, CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_KILL).",
    "Attack vector": "Local access is required to launch a container with files that have inheritable capabilities.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to cause a container to be launched with a compromised image, and enough privilege to cause a container to be launched with a compromised image.",
	"Affected component": "CRI-O"
