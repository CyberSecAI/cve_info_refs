Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the `getAdressen.php` endpoint. The application relies on two parameters: `LnrAdresse` (address ID) and `LnrGastKont` (guest ID). While both parameters are required to be present in the request, the `LnrAdresse` parameter is not properly validated or verified. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `LnrGastKont` parameter to access other users' information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses guest IDs in the request without verifying if the user is authorized to access that guest's information.
- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The `LnrAdresse` parameter is not validated, and the application does not enforce proper access control based on the `LnrGastKont` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can enumerate guest IDs by incrementing the `LnrGastKont` parameter and retrieve sensitive information of other users, including:
    - Full name
    - Date of Birth
    - Full Address
    - Phone Numbers
    - E-Mail address
    - Passport number
    - License Plate
    - Date of arrival and special whishes/notes
- **Exposure of Booking Information:** In conjunction with other endpoints, attackers can gain access to all booking details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can craft malicious HTTP requests to `getAdressen.php` by modifying the `LnrGastKont` parameter.
- **Web Browser Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be exploited using a standard web browser along with the developer tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to craft HTTP requests.
- **Web Browser Access:** The attacker requires access to a web browser with developer tools enabled.
- **Initial Guest ID:** The attacker needs a valid guest ID for initial access, which is obtained through the legitimate booking process.

**Additional Details:**
- The application uses a combination of hexadecimal representation and multiplication by 1000 to obfuscate IDs in the URL.
- The backend responds with Base64 encoded data. The final data is a HEX string, which needs to be decoded to readable format.
- The vulnerability affects multiple hotels (initially 4, later confirmed to be 11).
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) script was written in Python to demonstrate the enumeration of address information.
