Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application uses the `Host` header from the HTTP request to construct the redirect URL in the `Location` header of a 302 response. This allows an attacker to inject an arbitrary hostname.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Host Header Injection:** The application trusts the `Host` header value without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Open Redirection:** The application redirects the user to a URL constructed using the attacker-controlled `Host` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website by injecting a malicious domain into the `Host` header of the request.
- **Credential Theft:** Users could be tricked into providing their credentials on a fake login page hosted at the attacker controlled domain.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to vulnerable endpoints with a malicious `Host` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- No special privileges within the application are needed. An attacker simply needs to interact with the web application.

**Vulnerable Endpoints:**
The following endpoints are vulnerable to Host Header Injection:
1. `/symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewPersonalDetails`
2. `/symfony/web/index.php/auth/validateCredentials`
