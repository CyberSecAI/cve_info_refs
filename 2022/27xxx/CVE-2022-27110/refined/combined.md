| **Environment details** OrangeHRM version: 4.10 OrangeHRM source: Release build from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orangehrm) or Git clone Platform: Ubuntu PHP version: 7.3.33 Database and version: MariaDB 10.3 Web server: Apache 2.4.52  If applicable: Browser: Firefox  **Describe the bug** When an authenticated user submits the "Personal Details" form, a 302 redirect to the "Personal Details" URL is sent in the response. Following is a request and its response—  ``` POST /symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewPersonalDetails HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:97.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/97.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,/;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 332 Origin: http://localhost Connection: close Referer: http://localhost/symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewMyDetails Cookie: Loggedin=True; _orangehrm=1ba9si14k85n5cfdc39frt4mis Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1  personal%5B_csrf_token%5D=f80390168c630daa51a6ed85467cad78&personal%5BtxtEmpID%5D=2&personal%5BtxtEmpFirstName%5D=Pranav&personal%5BtxtEmpMiddleName%5D=&personal%5BtxtEmpLastName%5D=S&personal%5BtxtOtherID%5D=&personal%5BtxtLicExpDate%5D=yyyy-mm-dd&personal%5BoptGender%5D=1&personal%5BcmbMarital%5D=Single&personal%5BcmbNation%5D=0  ```  Response:  ``` HTTP/1.1 302 Found Date: Wed, 09 Mar 2022 05:49:01 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu) Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate Pragma: no-cache Location: http://localhost/symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewPersonalDetails/empNumber/2 Content-Length: 148 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8   ```  It was noticed that upon manipulating the Host header, in the POST request, to an arbitrary domain, it was possible to inject the Host header into the URL redirection in the 302 response. A user would then be redirected to the arbitrary domain. For example, the domain "example.com" can be passed as the value of the Host header in the POST request. The resulting 302 response redirects the user to <http://example.com/symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewPersonalDetails/empNumber/2>. Due to the nature of this vulnerability, it can be used in phishing attacks.  Following are the endpoints in the OrangeHRM application that are vulnerable to the Host Header Injection Redirect vulnerability:   1. /symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewPersonalDetails 2. /symfony/web/index.php/auth/validateCredentials   **To Reproduce**   1. Login to the OrangeHRM application 2. Navigate to "My Info" 3. Under "Personal Details", click on "Edit" 4. Turn on Intercept in Burp Suite (or any other web proxy) 5. Click on "Save" 6. Change the value of the `Host` header to `attacker.com` 7. Click on Forward in Burp and turn off Intercept 8. You will notice that the page gets redirected to `http://attacker.com/symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewPersonalDetails/empNumber/X`   **Expected behavior** A 404 error.  **What do you see instead:** A 302 redirect to the malicious domain.  **Screenshots** [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37404408/157669760-53d01d4d-03a2-4f62-8216-e4c120175c8a.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37404408/157669846-c47ca311-a7c6-444a-8275-defdec31003b.png) |

| Hi [@Vulf](https://github.com/Vulf) It's recommended to deploy the application with the valid hostname  ``` eg: nginx  server {     listen 80 default_server;     server_name mydomain.com;    ... }  ``` |
