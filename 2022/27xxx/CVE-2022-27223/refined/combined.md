Debian Bug     : 922204

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This update is unfortunately not available for the armel architecture.

CVE-2018-1108

    It was discovered that the random driver could generate random
    bytes through /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before
    gathering enough entropy that these would be unpredictable.  This
    could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted
    communications.

    The original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it
    caused the boot process to hang on many systems.  In this version,
    the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in
    gathering entropy without needing a hardware RNG.

CVE-2021-4149

    Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There
    is a potential lock imbalance in an error path.  A local user
    might be able to exploit this for denial of service.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0494

    The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an information leak only
    exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO
    capabilities.

CVE-2022-0812

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma)
    miscalculated the size of message headers, which could lead to a
    leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients.

    CAN/USB interface driver.

CVE-2022-30594

    Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between ptrace and
    seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still
    permitted to use ptrace() could exploit this to remove the seccomp
    restrictions.

CVE-2022-32250

    Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter which may
    result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-33981

    Yuan Ming from Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in
    the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl, which could
    lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy
    drive device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    This ioctl is now disabled by default.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.320-2.

For the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised
implementations of several cryptographic and CRC algorithms.  For at
least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to
a leak of sensitive information.

This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates
4.9.304-4.9.320 inclusive.  The random driver has been backported from
Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and correctness issues.  Some
changes will be visible:

- The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.  You may need
  to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space
  entropy gathering services to allow for this.

- On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more
  uses of /dev/urandom before it is fully initialised.  These uses
  were previously under-counted and this is not a regression.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

gpio: tegra186: Fix chip\_data type confusion
commit d1e972ace42390de739cde87d96043dcbe502286 upstream.
The tegra186 GPIO driver makes the assumption that the pointer
returned by irq\_data\_get\_irq\_chip\_data() is a pointer to a
tegra\_gpio structure. Unfortunately, it is actually a pointer
to the inner gpio\_chip structure, as mandated by the gpiolib
infrastructure. Nice try.
The saving grace is that the gpio\_chip is the first member of
tegra\_gpio, so the bug has gone undetected since... forever.
Fix it by performing a container\_of() on the pointer. This results
in no additional code, and makes it possible to understand how
the whole thing works.

tty: n\_gsm: fix deadlock in gsmtty\_open()
commit a2ab75b8e76e455af7867e3835fd9cdf386b508f upstream.
In the current implementation the user may open a virtual tty which then
could fail to establish the underlying DLCI. The function gsmtty\_open()
gets stuck in tty\_port\_block\_til\_ready() while waiting for a carrier rise.
This happens if the remote side fails to acknowledge the link establishment
request in time or completely. At some point gsm\_dlci\_close() is called
to abort the link establishment attempt. The function tries to inform the
associated virtual tty by performing a hangup. But the blocking loop within
tty\_port\_block\_til\_ready() is not informed about this event.
The patch proposed here fixes this by resetting the initialization state of
the virtual tty to ensure the loop exits and triggering it to make
tty\_port\_block\_til\_ready() return.

tty: n\_gsm: fix wrong modem processing in convergence layer type 2
commit 687f9ad43c52501f46164758e908a5dd181a87fc upstream.
The function gsm\_process\_modem() exists to handle modem status bits of
incoming frames. This includes incoming MSC (modem status command) frames
and convergence layer type 2 data frames. The function, however, was only
designed to handle MSC frames as it expects the command length. Within
gsm\_dlci\_data() it is wrongly assumed that this is the same as the data
frame length. This is only true if the data frame contains only 1 byte of
payload.
This patch names the length parameter of gsm\_process\_modem() in a generic
manner to reflect its association. It also corrects all calls to the
function to handle the variable number of modem status octets correctly in
both cases.

tty: n\_gsm: fix wrong tty control line for flow control
commit c19d93542a6081577e6da9bf5e887979c72e80c1 upstream.
tty flow control is handled via gsmtty\_throttle() and gsmtty\_unthrottle().
Both functions propagate the outgoing hardware flow control state to the
remote side via MSC (modem status command) frames. The local state is taken
from the RTS (ready to send) flag of the tty. However, RTS gets mapped to
DTR (data terminal ready), which is wrong.
This patch corrects this by mapping RTS to RTS.

tty: n\_gsm: fix NULL pointer access due to DLCI release
commit 96b169f05cdcc844b400695184d77e42071d14f2 upstream.
The here fixed commit made the tty hangup asynchronous to avoid a circular
locking warning. I could not reproduce this warning. Furthermore, due to
the asynchronous hangup the function call now gets queued up while the
underlying tty is being freed. Depending on the timing this results in a
NULL pointer access in the global work queue scheduler. To be precise in
process\_one\_work(). Therefore, the previous commit made the issue worse
which it tried to fix.
This patch fixes this by falling back to the old behavior which uses a
blocking tty hangup call before freeing up the associated tty.

tty: n\_gsm: fix proper link termination after failed open
commit e3b7468f082d106459e86e8dc6fb9bdd65553433 upstream.
Trying to open a DLCI by sending a SABM frame may fail with a timeout.
The link is closed on the initiator side without informing the responder
about this event. The responder assumes the link is open after sending a
UA frame to answer the SABM frame. The link gets stuck in a half open
state.
This patch fixes this by initiating the proper link termination procedure
after link setup timeout instead of silently closing it down.

tty: n\_gsm: fix encoding of command/response bit
commit 57435c42400ec147a527b2313188b649e81e449e upstream.
n\_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.2.1.2 describes the encoding of the
C/R (command/response) bit. Table 1 shows that the actual encoding of the
C/R bit is inverted if the associated frame is sent by the responder.
The referenced commit fixed here further broke the internal meaning of this
bit in the outgoing path by always setting the C/R bit regardless of the
frame type.
This patch fixes both by setting the C/R bit always consistently for
command (1) and response (0) frames and inverting it later for the
responder where necessary. The meaning of this bit in the debug output
is being preserved and shows the bit as if it was encoded by the initiator.
This reflects only the frame type rather than the encoded combination of
communication side and frame type.

tty: n\_gsm: fix encoding of control signal octet bit DV
commit 737b0ef3be6b319d6c1fd64193d1603311969326 upstream.
n\_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.4.6.3.7 describes the encoding of the
control signal octet used by the MSC (modem status command). The same
encoding is also used in convergence layer type 2 as described in chapter
5.5.2. Table 7 and 24 both require the DV (data valid) bit to be set 1 for
outgoing control signal octets sent by the DTE (data terminal equipment),
i.e. for the initiator side.
Currently, the DV bit is only set if CD (carrier detect) is on, regardless
of the side.
This patch fixes this behavior by setting the DV bit on the initiator side
unconditionally.

hugetlbfs: fix a truncation issue in hugepages parameter
commit e79ce9832316e09529b212a21278d68240ccbf1f upstream.
When we specify a large number for node in hugepages parameter, it may
be parsed to another number due to truncation in this statement:
node = tmp;
For example, add following parameter in command line:
hugepagesz=1G hugepages=4294967297:5
and kernel will allocate 5 hugepages for node 1 instead of ignoring it.
I move the validation check earlier to fix this issue, and slightly
simplifies the condition here.

riscv: fix oops caused by irqsoff latency tracer
commit 22e2100b1b07d6f5acc71cc1acb53f680c677d77 upstream.
The trace\_hardirqs\_{on,off}() require the caller to setup frame pointer
properly. This because these two functions use macro 'CALLER\_ADDR1' (aka.
\_\_builtin\_return\_address(1)) to acquire caller info. If the $fp is used
for other purpose, the code generated this macro (as below) could trigger
memory access fault.

commit aba2081e0a9c977396124aa6df93b55ed5912b19 upstream.
The interrupt mask is enabled before any potential failure points in
the driver, which can leave a failure path where we exit with
interrupts enabled but the device not live. This causes an infinite
stream of interrupts on an Apple M1 Pro laptop on USB-C.
Add a failure label that's used post enabling interrupts, where we
mask them again before returning an error.

RDMA/cma: Do not change route.addr.src\_addr outside state checks
commit 22e9f71072fa605cbf033158db58e0790101928d upstream.
If the state is not idle then resolve\_prepare\_src() should immediately
fail and no change to global state should happen. However, it
unconditionally overwrites the src\_addr trying to build a temporary any
address.
For instance if the state is already RDMA\_CM\_LISTEN then this will corrupt
the src\_addr and would cause the test in cma\_cancel\_operation():
if (cma\_any\_addr(cma\_src\_addr(id\_priv)) && !id\_priv->cma\_dev)
Which would manifest as this trace from syzkaller:

it over the src\_addr once it knows the state is valid.

btrfs: reduce extent threshold for autodefrag
commit 558732df2122092259ab4ef85594bee11dbb9104 upstream.
There is a big gap between inode\_should\_defrag() and autodefrag extent
size threshold. For inode\_should\_defrag() it has a flexible
@small\_write value. For compressed extent is 16K, and for non-compressed
extent it's 64K.
However for autodefrag extent size threshold, it's always fixed to the
default value (256K).
This means, the following write sequence will trigger autodefrag to
defrag ranges which didn't trigger autodefrag:
pwrite 0 8k
sync
pwrite 8k 128K
sync
The latter 128K write will also be considered as a defrag target (if
other conditions are met). While only that 8K write is really
triggering autodefrag.
Such behavior can cause extra IO for autodefrag.
Close the gap, by copying the @small\_write value into inode\_defrag, so
that later autodefrag can use the same @small\_write value which
triggered autodefrag.
With the existing transid value, this allows autodefrag really to scan
the ranges which triggered autodefrag.
Although this behavior change is mostly reducing the extent\_thresh value
for autodefrag, I believe in the future we should allow users to specify
the autodefrag extent threshold through mount options, but that's an
other problem to consider in the future.

btrfs: autodefrag: only scan one inode once
commit 26fbac2517fcad34fa3f950151fd4c0240fb2935 upstream.
Although we have btrfs\_requeue\_inode\_defrag(), for autodefrag we are
still just exhausting all inode\_defrag items in the tree.
This means, it doesn't make much difference to requeue an inode\_defrag,
other than scan the inode from the beginning till its end.
Change the behaviour to always scan from offset 0 of an inode, and till
the end.
By this we get the following benefit:
- Straight-forward code
- No more re-queue related check
- Fewer members in inode\_defrag
We still keep the same btrfs\_get\_fs\_root() and btrfs\_iget() check for
each loop, and added extra should\_auto\_defrag() check per-loop.
Note: the patch needs to be backported and is intentionally written
to minimize the diff size, code will be cleaned up later.

btrfs: defrag: allow defrag\_one\_cluster() to skip large extent which is not a target
commit 966d879bafaaf020c11a7cee9526f6dd823a4126 upstream.
In the rework of btrfs\_defrag\_file(), we always call
defrag\_one\_cluster() and increase the offset by cluster size, which is
only 256K.
But there are cases where we have a large extent (e.g. 128M) which
doesn't need to be defragged at all.
Before the refactor, we can directly skip the range, but now we have to
scan that extent map again and again until the cluster moves after the
non-target extent.
Fix the problem by allow defrag\_one\_cluster() to increase
btrfs\_defrag\_ctrl::last\_scanned to the end of an extent, if and only if
the last extent of the cluster is not a target.
The test script looks like this:
mkfs.btrfs -f $dev > /dev/null
mount $dev $mnt
# As btrfs ioctl uses 32M as extent\_threshold
xfs\_io -f -c "pwrite 0 64M" $mnt/file1
sync
# Some fragemented range to defrag
xfs\_io -s -c "pwrite 65548k 4k" \
-c "pwrite 65544k 4k" \
-c "pwrite 65540k 4k" \
-c "pwrite 65536k 4k" \
$mnt/file1
sync
echo "=== before ==="
xfs\_io -c "fiemap -v" $mnt/file1
echo "=== after ==="
btrfs fi defrag $mnt/file1
sync
xfs\_io -c "fiemap -v" $mnt/file1
umount $mnt
With extra ftrace put into defrag\_one\_cluster(), before the patch it
would result tons of loops:
(As defrag\_one\_cluster() is inlined, the function name is its caller)

btrfs: defrag: remove an ambiguous condition for rejection
commit 550f133f6959db927127111b50e483da3a7ce662 upstream.
From the very beginning of btrfs defrag, there is a check to reject
extents which meet both conditions:
- Physically adjacent
We may want to defrag physically adjacent extents to reduce the number
of extents or the size of subvolume tree.
- Larger than 128K
This may be there for compressed extents, but unfortunately 128K is
exactly the max capacity for compressed extents.
And the check is > 128K, thus it never rejects compressed extents.
Furthermore, the compressed extent capacity bug is fixed by previous
patch, there is no reason for that check anymore.
The original check has a very small ranges to reject (the target extent
size is > 128K, and default extent threshold is 256K), and for
compressed extent it doesn't work at all.
So it's better just to remove the rejection, and allow us to defrag
physically adjacent extents.

btrfs: defrag: don't defrag extents which are already at max capacity
commit 979b25c300dbcbcb750e88715018e04e854de6c6 upstream.
[BUG]
For compressed extents, defrag ioctl will always try to defrag any
compressed extents, wasting not only IO but also CPU time to
compress/decompress:
mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
mount -o compress $DEV $MNT
xfs\_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 128K" $MNT/foobar
sync
xfs\_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xcd 128K 128K" $MNT/foobar
sync
echo "=== before ==="
xfs\_io -c "fiemap -v" $MNT/foobar
btrfs filesystem defrag $MNT/foobar
sync
echo "=== after ==="
xfs\_io -c "fiemap -v" $MNT/foobar
Then it shows the 2 128K extents just get COW for no extra benefit, with
extra IO/CPU spent:
=== before ===
/mnt/btrfs/file1:
EXT: FILE-OFFSET BLOCK-RANGE TOTAL FLAGS
0: [0..255]: 26624..26879 256 0x8
1: [256..511]: 26632..26887 256 0x9
=== after ===
/mnt/btrfs/file1:
EXT: FILE-OFFSET BLOCK-RANGE TOTAL FLAGS
0: [0..255]: 26640..26895 256 0x8
1: [256..511]: 26648..26903 256 0x9
This affects not only v5.16 (after the defrag rework), but also v5.15
(before the defrag rework).
[CAUSE]
From the very beginning, btrfs defrag never checks if one extent is
already at its max capacity (128K for compressed extents, 128M
otherwise).
And the default extent size threshold is 256K, which is already beyond
the compressed extent max size.
This means, by default btrfs defrag ioctl will mark all compressed
extent which is not adjacent to a hole/preallocated range for defrag.
[FIX]
Introduce a helper to grab the maximum extent size, and then in
defrag\_collect\_targets() and defrag\_check\_next\_extent(), reject extents
which are already at their max capacity.

btrfs: defrag: don't try to merge regular extents with preallocated extents
commit 7093f15291e95f16dfb5a93307eda3272bfe1108 upstream.
[BUG]
With older kernels (before v5.16), btrfs will defrag preallocated extents.
While with newer kernels (v5.16 and newer) btrfs will not defrag
preallocated extents, but it will defrag the extent just before the
preallocated extent, even it's just a single sector.
This can be exposed by the following small script:
mkfs.btrfs -f $dev > /dev/null
mount $dev $mnt
xfs\_io -f -c "pwrite 0 4k" -c sync -c "falloc 4k 16K" $mnt/file
xfs\_io -c "fiemap -v" $mnt/file
btrfs fi defrag $mnt/file
sync
xfs\_io -c "fiemap -v" $mnt/file
The output looks like this on older kernels:
/mnt/btrfs/file:
EXT: FILE-OFFSET BLOCK-RANGE TOTAL FLAGS
0: [0..7]: 26624..26631 8 0x0
1: [8..39]: 26632..26663 32 0x801
/mnt/btrfs/file:
EXT: FILE-OFFSET BLOCK-RANGE TOTAL FLAGS
0: [0..39]: 26664..26703 40 0x1
Which defrags the single sector along with the preallocated extent, and
replace them with an regular extent into a new location (caused by data
COW).
This wastes most of the data IO just for the preallocated range.
On the other hand, v5.16 is slightly better:
/mnt/btrfs/file:
EXT: FILE-OFFSET BLOCK-RANGE TOTAL FLAGS
0: [0..7]: 26624..26631 8 0x0
1: [8..39]: 26632..26663 32 0x801
/mnt/btrfs/file:
EXT: FILE-OFFSET BLOCK-RANGE TOTAL FLAGS
0: [0..7]: 26664..26671 8 0x0
1: [8..39]: 26632..26663 32 0x801
The preallocated range is not defragged, but the sector before it still
gets defragged, which has no need for it.
[CAUSE]
One of the function reused by the old and new behavior is
defrag\_check\_next\_extent(), it will determine if we should defrag
current extent by checking the next one.
It only checks if the next extent is a hole or inlined, but it doesn't
check if it's preallocated.
On the other hand, out of the function, both old and new kernel will
reject preallocated extents.
Such inconsistent behavior causes above behavior.
[FIX]
- Also check if next extent is preallocated
If so, don't defrag current extent.
- Add comments for each branch why we reject the extent
This will reduce the IO caused by defrag ioctl and autodefrag.

driver core: Free DMA range map when device is released
commit d8f7a5484f2188e9af2d9e4e587587d724501b12 upstream.
When unbinding/binding a driver with DMA mapped memory, the DMA map is
not freed before the driver is reloaded. This leads to a memory leak
when the DMA map is overwritten when reprobing the driver.
This can be reproduced with a platform driver having a dma-range:
dummy {
...
#address-cells = <0x2>;
#size-cells = <0x2>;
ranges;
dma-ranges = <...>;
...
};
and then unbinding/binding it:
~# echo soc:dummy >/sys/bus/platform/drivers//unbind
DMA map object 0xffffff800b0ae540 still being held by &pdev->dev
~# echo soc:dummy >/sys/bus/platform/drivers//bind

mtd: core: Fix a conflict between MTD and NVMEM on wp-gpios property
commit 6c7621890995d089a56a06d11580d185ede7c2f8 upstream.
Wp-gpios property can be used on NVMEM nodes and the same property can
be also used on MTD NAND nodes. In case of the wp-gpios property is
defined at NAND level node, the GPIO management is done at NAND driver
level. Write protect is disabled when the driver is probed or resumed
and is enabled when the driver is released or suspended.
When no partitions are defined in the NAND DT node, then the NAND DT node
will be passed to NVMEM framework. If wp-gpios property is defined in
this node, the GPIO resource is taken twice and the NAND controller
driver fails to probe.
A new Boolean flag named ignore\_wp has been added in nvmem\_config.
In case ignore\_wp is set, it means that the GPIO is handled by the
provider. Lets set this flag in MTD layer to avoid the conflict on
wp\_gpios property.

It would be possible to set config->wp\_gpio at MTD level before calling
nvmem\_register function but NVMEM framework will toggle this GPIO on
each write when this GPIO should only be controlled at NAND level driver
to ensure that the Write Protect has not been enabled.
A way to fix this conflict is to add a new boolean flag in nvmem\_config
named ignore\_wp. In case ignore\_wp is set, the GPIO resource will
be managed by the provider.

xhci: Prevent futile URB re-submissions due to incorrect return value.

The -ENODEV return value from xhci\_check\_args() is incorrectly changed
to -EINVAL in a couple places before propagated further.
xhci\_check\_args() returns 4 types of value, -ENODEV, -EINVAL, 1 and 0.
xhci\_urb\_enqueue and xhci\_check\_streams\_endpoint return -EINVAL if
the return value of xhci\_check\_args <= 0.
This causes problems for example r8152\_submit\_rx, calling usb\_submit\_urb
in drivers/net/usb/r8152.c.
r8152\_submit\_rx will never get -ENODEV after submiting an urb when xHC
is halted because xhci\_urb\_enqueue returns -EINVAL in the very beginning.

usb: dwc3: gadget: Let the interrupt handler disable bottom halves.
commit 84918a89d6efaff075de570b55642b6f4ceeac6d upstream.
The interrupt service routine registered for the gadget is a primary
handler which mask the interrupt source and a threaded handler which
handles the source of the interrupt. Since the threaded handler is
voluntary threaded, the IRQ-core does not disable bottom halves before
invoke the handler like it does for the forced-threaded handler.
Due to changes in networking it became visible that a network gadget's
completions handler may schedule a softirq which remains unprocessed.
The gadget's completion handler is usually invoked either in hard-IRQ or
soft-IRQ context. In this context it is enough to just raise the softirq
because the softirq itself will be handled once that context is left.
In the case of the voluntary threaded handler, there is nothing that
will process pending softirqs. Which means it remain queued until
another random interrupt (on this CPU) fires and handles it on its exit
path or another thread locks and unlocks a lock with the bh suffix.
Worst case is that the CPU goes idle and the NOHZ complains about
unhandled softirqs.
Disable bottom halves before acquiring the lock (and disabling
interrupts) and enable them after dropping the lock. This ensures that
any pending softirqs will handled right away.

commit d7c93a903f33ff35aa0e6b5a8032eb9755b00826 upstream.
Commit e0082698b689 ("usb: dwc3: ulpi: conditionally resume ULPI PHY")
fixed an issue where ULPI transfers would timeout if any requests where
send to the phy sometime after init, giving it enough time to auto-suspend.
Commit e5f4ca3fce90 ("usb: dwc3: ulpi: Fix USB2.0 HS/FS/LS PHY suspend
regression") changed the behavior to instead of clearing the
DWC3\_GUSB2PHYCFG\_SUSPHY bit, add an extra sleep when it is set.
But on Bay Trail devices, when phy\_set\_mode() gets called during init,
this leads to errors like these:
[ 28.451522] tusb1210 dwc3.ulpi: error -110 writing val 0x01 to reg 0x0a
[ 28.464089] tusb1210 dwc3.ulpi: error -110 writing val 0x01 to reg 0x0a
Add "snps,dis\_u2\_susphy\_quirk" to the settings for Bay Trail devices to
fix this. This restores the old behavior for Bay Trail devices, since
previously the DWC3\_GUSB2PHYCFG\_SUSPHY bit would get cleared on the first
ulpi\_read/\_write() and then was never set again.

usb: dwc2: drd: fix soft connect when gadget is unconfigured
commit 32fde84362c40961726a5c91f35ad37355ccc0c6 upstream.
When the gadget driver hasn't been (yet) configured, and the cable is
connected to a HOST, the SFTDISCON gets cleared unconditionally, so the
HOST tries to enumerate it.
At the host side, this can result in a stuck USB port or worse. When
getting lucky, some dmesg can be observed at the host side:
new high-speed USB device number ...
device descriptor read/64, error -110
Fix it in drd, by checking the enabled flag before calling
dwc2\_hsotg\_core\_connect(). It will be called later, once configured,
by the normal flow:
- udc\_bind\_to\_driver
- usb\_gadget\_connect
- dwc2\_hsotg\_pullup
- dwc2\_hsotg\_core\_connect

tracefs: Set the group ownership in apply\_options() not parse\_options()
commit 851e99ebeec3f4a672bb5010cf1ece095acee447 upstream.
Al Viro brought it to my attention that the dentries may not be filled
when the parse\_options() is called, causing the call to set\_gid() to
possibly crash. It should only be called if parse\_options() succeeds
totally anyway.
He suggested the logical place to do the update is in apply\_options().

The HPT371 chip physically has only one channel, the secondary one,

manually disable the non-existing channel if the BIOS hasn't done this
already. Similarly to the pata\_hpt3x2n driver, always disable the

sc16is7xx: Fix for incorrect data being transmitted
commit eebb0f4e894f1e9577a56b337693d1051dd6ebfd upstream.
UART drivers are meant to use the port spinlock within certain
methods, to protect against reentrancy. The sc16is7xx driver does
very little locking, presumably because when added it triggers
"scheduling while atomic" errors. This is due to the use of mutexes
within the regmap abstraction layer, and the mutex implementation's
habit of sleeping the current thread while waiting for access.
Unfortunately this lack of interlocking can lead to corruption of
outbound data, which occurs when the buffer used for I2C transmission
is used simultaneously by two threads - a work queue thread running
sc16is7xx\_tx\_proc, and an IRQ thread in sc16is7xx\_port\_irq, both
of which can call sc16is7xx\_handle\_tx.
An earlier patch added efr\_lock, a mutex that controls access to the
EFR register. This mutex is already claimed in the IRQ handler, and
all that is required is to claim the same mutex in sc16is7xx\_tx\_proc.
See: https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/4885

iio: Fix error handling for PM
commit 632fe0bb8c5b9c06ec961f575ee42a6fff5eceeb upstream.
The pm\_runtime\_enable will increase power disable depth.
If the probe fails, we should use pm\_runtime\_disable() to balance
pm\_runtime\_enable(). In the PM Runtime docs:
Drivers in ->remove() callback should undo the runtime PM changes done
in ->probe(). Usually this means calling pm\_runtime\_disable(),
pm\_runtime\_dont\_use\_autosuspend() etc.
We should do this in error handling.
Fix this problem for the following drivers: bmc150, bmg160, kmx61,
kxcj-1013, mma9551, mma9553.

When commit e6ac2450d6de ("bpf: Support bpf program calling kernel function") added

reg type to the appropriate btf\_vmlinux BTF ID, however
commit c25b2ae13603 ("bpf: Replace PTR\_TO\_XXX\_OR\_NULL with PTR\_TO\_XXX | PTR\_MAYBE\_NULL")
moved the \_\_BPF\_REG\_TYPE\_MAX from the last member of bpf\_reg\_type enum to after
the base register types, and defined other variants using type flag
composition. However, now, the direct usage of reg->type to index into
reg2btf\_ids may no longer fall into \_\_BPF\_REG\_TYPE\_MAX range, and hence lead to
out of bounds access and kernel crash on dereference of bad pointer.

and punt to PTR\_TO\_MEM block if reg->type does not fall in one of
PTR\_TO\_BTF\_ID or PTR\_TO\_SOCK\* types. This will be used by future commits
to get access to XDP and TC PTR\_TO\_CTX, and pass various data (flags,
l4proto, netns\_id, etc.) encoded in opts struct passed as pointer to
kfunc.
For PTR\_TO\_MEM support, arguments are currently limited to pointer to
scalar, or pointer to struct composed of scalars. This is done so that
unsafe scenarios (like passing PTR\_TO\_MEM where PTR\_TO\_BTF\_ID of
in-kernel valid structure is expected, which may have pointers) are
avoided. Since the argument checking happens basd on argument register
type, it is not easy to ascertain what the expected type is. In the
future, support for PTR\_TO\_MEM for kfunc can be extended to serve other
usecases. The struct type whose pointer is passed in may have maximum
nesting depth of 4, all recursively composed of scalars or struct with
scalars.
Future commits will add negative tests that check whether these
restrictions imposed for kfunc arguments are duly rejected by BPF
verifier or not.

configfs: fix a race in configfs\_{,un}register\_subsystem()
[ Upstream commit 84ec758fb2daa236026506868c8796b0500c047d ]
When configfs\_register\_subsystem() or configfs\_unregister\_subsystem()
is executing link\_group() or unlink\_group(),
it is possible that two processes add or delete list concurrently.
Some unfortunate interleavings of them can cause kernel panic.
One of cases is:
A --> B --> C --> D
A <-- B <-- C <-- D
delete list\_head \*B | delete list\_head \*C
--------------------------------|-----------------------------------
configfs\_unregister\_subsystem | configfs\_unregister\_subsystem
unlink\_group | unlink\_group
unlink\_obj | unlink\_obj
list\_del\_init | list\_del\_init
\_\_list\_del\_entry | \_\_list\_del\_entry
\_\_list\_del | \_\_list\_del
// next == C |
next->prev = prev |
| next->prev = prev
prev->next = next |
| // prev == B
| prev->next = next
Fix this by adding mutex when calling link\_group() or unlink\_group(),
but parent configfs\_subsystem is NULL when config\_item is root.
So I create a mutex configfs\_subsystem\_mutex.

bnxt\_en: Increase firmware message response DMA wait time
[ Upstream commit b891106da52b2c12dbaf73400f6d225b06a38d80 ]
When polling for the firmware message response, we first poll for the
response message header. Once the valid length is detected in the
header, we poll for the valid bit at the end of the message which
signals DMA completion. Normally, this poll time for DMA completion
is extremely short (0 to a few usec). But on some devices under some
rare conditions, it can be up to about 20 msec.
Increase this delay to 50 msec and use udelay() for the first 10 usec
for the common case, and usleep\_range() beyond that.
Also, change the error message to include the above delay time when
printing the timeout value.

regmap-irq: Update interrupt clear register for proper reset
[ Upstream commit d04ad245d67a3991dfea5e108e4c452c2ab39bac ]
With the existing logic where clear\_ack is true (HW doesn’t support
auto clear for ICR), interrupt clear register reset is not handled
properly. Due to this only the first interrupts get processed properly
and further interrupts are blocked due to not resetting interrupt
clear register.
Example for issue case where Invert\_ack is false and clear\_ack is true:
Say Default ISR=0x00 & ICR=0x00 and ISR is triggered with 2
interrupts making ISR = 0x11.
Step 1: Say ISR is set 0x11 (store status\_buff = ISR). ISR needs to
be cleared with the help of ICR once the Interrupt is processed.
Step 2: Write ICR = 0x11 (status\_buff), this will clear the ISR to 0x00.
Step 3: Issue - In the existing code, ICR is written with ICR =
~(status\_buff) i.e ICR = 0xEE -> This will block all the interrupts
from raising except for interrupts 0 and 4. So expectation here is to
reset ICR, which will unblock all the interrupts.
if (chip->clear\_ack) {
if (chip->ack\_invert && !ret)
........
else if (!ret)
ret = regmap\_write(map, reg,
~data->status\_buf[i]);
So writing 0 and 0xff (when ack\_invert is true) should have no effect, other
than clearing the ACKs just set.

gpio: rockchip: Reset int\_bothedge when changing trigger

With v2 hardware, an IRQ can be configured to trigger on both edges via
a bit in the int\_bothedge register. Currently, the driver sets this bit
when changing the trigger type to IRQ\_TYPE\_EDGE\_BOTH, but fails to reset
this bit if the trigger type is later changed to something else. This
causes spurious IRQs, and when using gpio-keys with wakeup-event-action
set to EV\_ACT\_(DE)ASSERTED, those IRQs translate into spurious wakeups.

In zynq\_qspi\_exec\_mem\_op(), kzalloc() is directly used in memset(),

Fix this bug by adding a check of tmpbuf.
This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
the callers, so they constitute bugs.
Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
the bug.
Builds with CONFIG\_SPI\_ZYNQ\_QSPI=m show no new warnings,
and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.

net/mlx5e: kTLS, Use CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY for device-offloaded packets
commit 7eaf1f37b8817c608c4e959d69986ef459d345cd upstream.
For RX TLS device-offloaded packets, the HW spec guarantees checksum
validation for the offloaded packets, but does not define whether the
CQE.checksum field matches the original packet (ciphertext) or
the decrypted one (plaintext). This latitude allows architetctural
improvements between generations of chips, resulting in different decisions
regarding the value type of CQE.checksum.
Hence, for these packets, the device driver should not make use of this CQE
field. Here we block CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE usage for RX TLS device-offloaded
packets, and use CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY instead.
Value of the packet's tcp\_hdr.csum is not modified by the HW, and it always
matches the original ciphertext.

account for that - otherwise we can deplete MODIFY\_ACTION memory just by

net/mlx5: DR, Cache STE shadow memory
commit e5b2bc30c21139ae10f0e56989389d0bc7b7b1d6 upstream.
During rule insertion on each ICM memory chunk we also allocate shadow memory
used for management. This includes the hw\_ste, dr\_ste and miss list per entry.
Since the scale of these allocations is large we noticed a performance hiccup
that happens once malloc and free are stressed.
In extreme usecases when ~1M chunks are freed at once, it might take up to 40
seconds to complete this, up to the point the kernel sees this as self-detected
stall on CPU:
rcu: INFO: rcu\_sched self-detected stall on CPU
To resolve this we will increase the reuse of shadow memory.
Doing this we see that a time in the aforementioned usecase dropped from ~40
seconds to ~8-10 seconds.

surface: surface3\_power: Fix battery readings on batteries without a serial number
commit 21d90aaee8d5c2a097ef41f1430d97661233ecc6 upstream.
The battery on the 2nd hand Surface 3 which I recently bought appears to
not have a serial number programmed in. This results in any I2C reads from
the registers containing the serial number failing with an I2C NACK.
This was causing mshw0011\_bix() to fail causing the battery readings to

continue with an empty serial number to fix this.

net/smc: Use a mutex for locking "struct smc\_pnettable"
commit 7ff57e98fb78ad94edafbdc7435f2d745e9e6bb5 upstream.
smc\_pnetid\_by\_table\_ib() uses read\_lock() and then it calls smc\_pnet\_apply\_ib()
which, in turn, calls mutex\_lock(&smc\_ib\_devices.mutex).
read\_lock() disables preemption. Therefore, the code acquires a mutex while in
atomic context and it leads to a SAC bug.
Fix this bug by replacing the rwlock with a mutex.

netfilter: nf\_tables: fix memory leak during stateful obj update
commit dad3bdeef45f81a6e90204bcc85360bb76eccec7 upstream.
stateful objects can be updated from the control plane.
The transaction logic allocates a temporary object for this purpose.
The ->init function was called for this object, so plain kfree() leaks
resources. We must call ->destroy function of the object.
nft\_obj\_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,
but the update path doesn't increment it.
To avoid special-casing the update object release, do module\_get for
the update case too and release it via nft\_obj\_destroy().

PHY detect failure started to show after commit 7590fc6f80ac ("net:

10ms is meant to match the time it take to send the probed message over

net: dsa: avoid call to \_\_dev\_set\_promiscuity() while rtnl\_mutex isn't held
commit 8940e6b669ca1196ce0a0549c819078096390f76 upstream.
If the DSA master doesn't support IFF\_UNICAST\_FLT, then the following
call path is possible:
dsa\_slave\_switchdev\_event\_work
-> dsa\_port\_host\_fdb\_add
-> dev\_uc\_add
-> \_\_dev\_set\_rx\_mode
-> \_\_dev\_set\_promiscuity
Since the blamed commit, dsa\_slave\_switchdev\_event\_work() no longer
holds rtnl\_lock(), which triggers the ASSERT\_RTNL() from
\_\_dev\_set\_promiscuity().
Taking rtnl\_lock() around dev\_uc\_add() is impossible, because all the
code paths that call dsa\_flush\_workqueue() do so from contexts where the
rtnl\_mutex is already held - so this would lead to an instant deadlock.
dev\_uc\_add() in itself doesn't require the rtnl\_mutex for protection.
There is this comment in \_\_dev\_set\_rx\_mode() which assumes so:
/\* Unicast addresses changes may only happen under the rtnl,
\* therefore calling \_\_dev\_set\_promiscuity here is safe.
\*/
but it is from commit 4417da668c00 ("[NET]: dev: secondary unicast
address support") dated June 2007, and in the meantime, commit
f1f28aa3510d ("netdev: Add addr\_list\_lock to struct net\_device."), dated
July 2008, has added &dev->addr\_list\_lock to protect this instead of the
global rtnl\_mutex.
Nonetheless, \_\_dev\_set\_promiscuity() does assume rtnl\_mutex protection,
but it is the uncommon path of what we typically expect dev\_uc\_add()
to do. So since only the uncommon path requires rtnl\_lock(), just check
ahead of time whether dev\_uc\_add() would result into a call to
\_\_dev\_set\_promiscuity(), and handle that condition separately.
DSA already configures the master interface to be promiscuous if the
tagger requires this. We can extend this to also cover the case where
the master doesn't handle dev\_uc\_add() (doesn't support IFF\_UNICAST\_FLT),
and on the premise that we'd end up making it promiscuous during
operation anyway, either if a DSA slave has a non-inherited MAC address,
or if the bridge notifies local FDB entries for its own MAC address, the
address of a station learned on a foreign port, etc.

net: Force inlining of checksum functions in net/checksum.h
commit 5486f5bf790b5c664913076c3194b8f916a5c7ad upstream.
All functions defined as static inline in net/checksum.h are
meant to be inlined for performance reason.
But since commit ac7c3e4ff401 ("compiler: enable
CONFIG\_OPTIMIZE\_INLINING forcibly") the compiler is allowed to
uninline functions when it wants.
Fair enough in the general case, but for tiny performance critical
checksum helpers that's counter-productive.
The problem mainly arises when selecting CONFIG\_CC\_OPTIMISE\_FOR\_SIZE,
Those helpers being 'static inline' in header files you suddenly find
them duplicated many times in the resulting vmlinux.
Here is a typical exemple when building powerpc pmac32\_defconfig
with CONFIG\_CC\_OPTIMISE\_FOR\_SIZE. csum\_sub() appears 4 times:

drm/vc4: crtc: Fix runtime\_pm reference counting
commit 6764eb690e77ecded48587d6d4e346ba2e196546 upstream.
At boot on the BCM2711, if the HDMI controllers are running, the CRTC
driver will disable itself and its associated HDMI controller to work
around a hardware bug that would leave some pixels stuck in a FIFO.
In order to avoid that issue, we need to run some operations in lockstep
between the CRTC and HDMI controller, and we need to make sure the HDMI
controller will be powered properly.
However, since we haven't enabled it through KMS, the runtime\_pm state
is off at this point so we need to make sure the device is powered
through pm\_runtime\_resume\_and\_get, and once the operations are complete,
we call pm\_runtime\_put.
However, the HDMI controller will do that itself in its
post\_crtc\_powerdown, which means we'll end up calling pm\_runtime\_put for
a single pm\_runtime\_get, throwing the reference counting off. Let's
remove the pm\_runtime\_put call in the CRTC code in order to have the
proper counting.

drm/edid: Always set RGB444
commit ecbd4912a693b862e25cba0a6990a8c95b00721e upstream.
In order to fill the drm\_display\_info structure each time an EDID is
read, the code currently will call drm\_add\_display\_info with the parsed
EDID.
drm\_add\_display\_info will then call drm\_reset\_display\_info to reset all
the fields to 0, and then set them to the proper value depending on the
EDID.
In the color\_formats case, we will thus report that we don't support any
color format, and then fill it back with RGB444 plus the additional
formats described in the EDID Feature Support byte.
However, since that byte only contains format-related bits since the 1.4
specification, this doesn't happen if the EDID is following an earlier
specification. In turn, it means that for one of these EDID, we end up
with color\_formats set to 0.
The EDID 1.3 specification never really specifies what it means by RGB
exactly, but since both HDMI and DVI will use RGB444, it's fairly safe
to assume it's supposed to be RGB444.
Let's move the addition of RGB444 to color\_formats earlier in
drm\_add\_display\_info() so that it's always set for a digital display.

openvswitch: Fix setting ipv6 fields causing hw csum failure
commit d9b5ae5c1b241b91480aa30408be12fe91af834a upstream.
Ipv6 ttl, label and tos fields are modified without first
pulling/pushing the ipv6 header, which would have updated
the hw csum (if available). This might cause csum validation
when sending the packet to the stack, as can be seen in
the trace below.
Fix this by updating skb->csum if available.
Trace resulted by ipv6 ttl dec and then sending packet
to conntrack [actions: set(ipv6(hlimit=63)),ct(zone=99)]:

Obtaining a MAC address may be deferred in cases when the MAC is stored

retrieval attempt and return EPROBE\_DEFER.
It is also possible that a port that does not rely on NVMEM has been

allocated previously must be freed when doing a roll-back.

gso: do not skip outer ip header in case of ipip and net\_failover
commit cc20cced0598d9a5ff91ae4ab147b3b5e99ee819 upstream.
We encounter a tcp drop issue in our cloud environment. Packet GROed in
host forwards to a VM virtio\_net nic with net\_failover enabled. VM acts
as a IPVS LB with ipip encapsulation. The full path like:
host gro -> vm virtio\_net rx -> net\_failover rx -> ipvs fullnat
-> ipip encap -> net\_failover tx -> virtio\_net tx
When net\_failover transmits a ipip pkt (gso\_type = 0x0103, which means
SKB\_GSO\_TCPV4, SKB\_GSO\_DODGY and SKB\_GSO\_IPXIP4), there is no gso
did because it supports TSO and GSO\_IPXIP4. But network\_header points to
inner ip header.
Call Trace:
tcp4\_gso\_segment ------> return NULL
inet\_gso\_segment ------> inner iph, network\_header points to
ipip\_gso\_segment
inet\_gso\_segment ------> outer iph
skb\_mac\_gso\_segment
Afterwards virtio\_net transmits the pkt, only inner ip header is modified.
And the outer one just keeps unchanged. The pkt will be dropped in remote
host.
Call Trace:
inet\_gso\_segment ------> inner iph, outer iph is skipped
skb\_mac\_gso\_segment
\_\_skb\_gso\_segment

The root cause of this issue is specific with the rare combination of
SKB\_GSO\_DODGY and a tunnel device that adds an SKB\_GSO\_ tunnel option.
SKB\_GSO\_DODGY is set from external virtio\_net. We need to reset network
header when callbacks.gso\_segment() returns NULL.
This patch also includes ipv6\_gso\_segment(), considering SIT, etc.

clk: qcom: gcc-msm8994: Remove NoC clocks
commit 3494894afff4ad11f25d8342cc99699be496d082 upstream.
Just like in commit 05cf3ec00d46 ("clk: qcom: gcc-msm8996: Drop (again)
gcc\_aggre1\_pnoc\_ahb\_clk") adding NoC clocks turned out to be a huge
mistake, as they cause a lot of issues at little benefit (basically
letting Linux know about their children's frequencies), especially when
mishandled or misconfigured.
Adding these ones broke SDCC approx 99 out of 100 times, but that somehow
went unnoticed. To prevent further issues like this one, remove them.
This commit is effectively a revert of 74a33fac3aab ("clk: qcom:

tipc: Fix end of loop tests for list\_for\_each\_entry()
commit a1f8fec4dac8bc7b172b2bdbd881e015261a6322 upstream.
These tests are supposed to check if the loop exited via a break or not.
However the tests are wrong because if we did not exit via a break then
"p" is not a valid pointer. In that case, it's the equivalent of
"if (\*(u32 \*)sr == \*last\_key) {". That's going to work most of the time,
but there is a potential for those to be equal.

bpf: Add schedule points in batch ops
commit 75134f16e7dd0007aa474b281935c5f42e79f2c8 upstream.
syzbot reported various soft lockups caused by bpf batch operations.
INFO: task kworker/1:1:27 blocked for more than 140 seconds.
INFO: task hung in rcu\_barrier
Nothing prevents batch ops to process huge amount of data,
we need to add schedule points in them.
Note that maybe\_wait\_bpf\_programs(map) calls from
generic\_map\_delete\_batch() can be factorized by moving
the call after the loop.
This will be done later in -next tree once we get this fix merged,
unless there is strong opinion doing this optimization sooner.

bpf: Fix a bpf\_timer initialization issue
commit 5eaed6eedbe9612f642ad2b880f961d1c6c8ec2b upstream.
The patch in [1] intends to fix a bpf\_timer related issue,
but the fix caused existing 'timer' selftest to fail with
hang or some random errors. After some debug, I found
an issue with check\_and\_init\_map\_value() in the hashtab.c.
More specifically, in hashtab.c, we have code
l\_new = bpf\_map\_kmalloc\_node(&htab->map, ...)
check\_and\_init\_map\_value(&htab->map, l\_new...)
Note that bpf\_map\_kmalloc\_node() does not do initialization
so l\_new contains random value.
The function check\_and\_init\_map\_value() intends to zero the
bpf\_spin\_lock and bpf\_timer if they exist in the map.
But I found bpf\_spin\_lock is zero'ed but bpf\_timer is not zero'ed.
With [1], later copy\_map\_value() skips copying of
bpf\_spin\_lock and bpf\_timer. The non-zero bpf\_timer caused
random failures for 'timer' selftest.
Without [1], for both bpf\_spin\_lock and bpf\_timer case,
bpf\_timer will be zero'ed, so 'timer' self test is okay.
For check\_and\_init\_map\_value(), why bpf\_spin\_lock is zero'ed
properly while bpf\_timer not. In bpf uapi header, we have
struct bpf\_spin\_lock {
\_\_u32 val;
};
struct bpf\_timer {
\_\_u64 :64;
\_\_u64 :64;
} \_\_attribute\_\_((aligned(8)));
The initialization code:
\*(struct bpf\_spin\_lock \*)(dst + map->spin\_lock\_off) =
(struct bpf\_spin\_lock){};
\*(struct bpf\_timer \*)(dst + map->timer\_off) =
(struct bpf\_timer){};
It appears the compiler has no obligation to initialize anonymous fields.
For example, let us use clang with bpf target as below:
$ cat t.c
struct bpf\_timer {
unsigned long long :64;
};
struct bpf\_timer2 {
unsigned long long a;
};
void test(struct bpf\_timer \*t) {
\*t = (struct bpf\_timer){};
}
void test2(struct bpf\_timer2 \*t) {
\*t = (struct bpf\_timer2){};
}
$ clang -target bpf -O2 -c -g t.c
$ llvm-objdump -d t.o
...
0000000000000000 :
0: 95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 exit

Except where explicitly stated otherwise, for the purposes of
this subclause unnamed members of objects of structure and union
type do not participate in initialization. Unnamed members of

To fix the problem, let use memset for bpf\_timer case in
check\_and\_init\_map\_value(). For consistency, memset is also
used for bpf\_spin\_lock case.

bpf\_msg\_push\_data may return a non-zero value to indicate an error. The
return value should be checked to prevent undetected errors.
To indicate an error, the BPF programs now perform a different action
than their intended one to make the userspace test program notice the
error, i.e., the programs supposed to pass/redirect drop, the program
supposed to drop passes.

bpf: Do not try bpf\_msg\_push\_data with len 0
commit 4a11678f683814df82fca9018d964771e02d7e6d upstream.
If bpf\_msg\_push\_data() is called with len 0 (as it happens during
selftests/bpf/test\_sockmap), we do not need to do anything and can
return early.
Calling bpf\_msg\_push\_data() with len 0 previously lead to a wrong ENOMEM
error: we later called get\_order(copy + len); if len was 0, copy + len
was also often 0 and get\_order() returned some undefined value (at the
moment 52). alloc\_pages() caught that and failed, but then bpf\_msg\_push\_data()
returned ENOMEM. This was wrong because we are most probably not out of
memory and actually do not need any additional memory.

bpf: Fix crash due to incorrect copy\_map\_value
commit a8abb0c3dc1e28454851a00f8b7333d9695d566c upstream.
When both bpf\_spin\_lock and bpf\_timer are present in a BPF map value,
copy\_map\_value needs to skirt both objects when copying a value into and
out of the map. However, the current code does not set both s\_off and
t\_off in copy\_map\_value, which leads to a crash when e.g. bpf\_spin\_lock
is placed in map value with bpf\_timer, as bpf\_map\_update\_elem call will
be able to overwrite the other timer object.
When the issue is not fixed, an overwriting can produce the following

ice: fix concurrent reset and removal of VFs
commit fadead80fe4c033b5e514fcbadd20b55c4494112 upstream.
Commit c503e63200c6 ("ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown")
introduced a driver state flag, ICE\_VF\_DEINIT\_IN\_PROGRESS, which is
intended to prevent some issues with concurrently handling messages from
VFs while tearing down the VFs.
This change was motivated by crashes caused while tearing down and
bringing up VFs in rapid succession.
It turns out that the fix actually introduces issues with the VF driver
caused because the PF no longer responds to any messages sent by the VF
during its .remove routine. This results in the VF potentially removing
its DMA memory before the PF has shut down the device queues.
Additionally, the fix doesn't actually resolve concurrency issues within
the ice driver. It is possible for a VF to initiate a reset just prior
to the ice driver removing VFs. This can result in the remove task
concurrently operating while the VF is being reset. This results in
similar memory corruption and panics purportedly fixed by that commit.
Fix this concurrency at its root by protecting both the reset and
removal flows using the existing VF cfg\_lock. This ensures that we
cannot remove the VF while any outstanding critical tasks such as a
virtchnl message or a reset are occurring.
This locking change also fixes the root cause originally fixed by commit
c503e63200c6 ("ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown"), so we
can simply revert it.
Note that I kept these two changes together because simply reverting the
original commit alone would leave the driver vulnerable to worse race
conditions.

bnxt\_en: Restore the resets\_reliable flag in bnxt\_open()
commit 0e0e3c5358470cbad10bd7ca29f84a44d179d286 upstream.
During ifdown, we call bnxt\_inv\_fw\_health\_reg() which will clear
both the status\_reliable and resets\_reliable flags if these
registers are mapped. This is correct because a FW reset during
ifdown will clear these register mappings. If we detect that FW
has gone through reset during the next ifup, we will remap these
registers.
But during normal ifup with no FW reset, we need to restore the
resets\_reliable flag otherwise we will not show the reset counter
during devlink diagnose.

bnxt\_en: Fix occasional ethtool -t loopback test failures
commit cfcab3b3b61584a02bb523ffa99564eafa761dfe upstream.
In the current code, we setup the port to PHY or MAC loopback mode
and then transmit a test broadcast packet for the loopback test. This
scheme fails sometime if the port is shared with management firmware
that can also send packets. The driver may receive the management
firmware's packet and the test will fail when the contents don't
match the test packet.
Change the test packet to use it's own MAC address as the destination
and setup the port to only receive it's own MAC address. This should
filter out other packets sent by management firmware.

selftests: mptcp: be more conservative with cookie MPJ limits
commit e35f885b357d47e04380a2056d1b2cc3e6f4f24b upstream.
Since commit 2843ff6f36db ("mptcp: remote addresses fullmesh"), an
MPTCP client can attempt creating multiple MPJ subflow simultaneusly.
In such scenario the server, when syncookies are enabled, could end-up
accepting incoming MPJ syn even above the configured subflow limit, as
the such limit can be enforced in a reliable way only after the subflow
creation. In case of syncookie, only after the 3rd ack reception.
As a consequence the related self-tests case sporadically fails, as it
verify that the server always accept the expected number of MPJ syn.
Address the issues relaxing the MPJ syn number constrain. Note that the
check on the accepted number of MPJ 3rd ack still remains intact.

mptcp: add mibs counter for ignored incoming options
commit f73c1194634506ab60af0debef04671fc431a435 upstream.
The MPTCP in kernel path manager has some constraints on incoming
addresses announce processing, so that in edge scenarios it can
end-up dropping (ignoring) some of such announces.
The above is not very limiting in practice since such scenarios are
very uncommon and MPTCP will recover due to ADD\_ADDR retransmissions.
This patch adds a few MIB counters to account for such drop events
to allow easier introspection of the critical scenarios.

perf data: Fix double free in perf\_session\_\_delete()
commit 69560e366fc4d5fca7bebb0e44edbfafc8bcaf05 upstream.
When perf\_data\_\_create\_dir() fails, it calls close\_dir(), but
perf\_session\_\_delete() also calls close\_dir() and since dir.version and
dir.nr were initialized by perf\_data\_\_create\_dir(), a double free occurs.
This patch moves the initialization of dir.version and dir.nr after
successful initialization of dir.files, that prevents double freeing.
This behavior is already implemented in perf\_data\_\_open\_dir().

perf evlist: Fix failed to use cpu list for uncore events
commit 8a3d2ee0de3828e0d01f9682d35ee53704659bd0 upstream.
The 'perf record' and 'perf stat' commands have supported the option
'-C/--cpus' to count or collect only on the list of CPUs provided.
Commit 1d3351e631fc34d7 ("perf tools: Enable on a list of CPUs for
hybrid") add it to be supported for hybrid. For hybrid support, it
checks the cpu list are available on hybrid PMU. But when we test only
uncore events(or events not in cpu\_core and cpu\_atom), there is a bug:
Before:
# perf stat -C0 -e uncore\_clock/clockticks/ sleep 1
failed to use cpu list 0
In this case, for uncore event, its pmu\_name is not cpu\_core or
cpu\_atom, so in evlist\_\_fix\_hybrid\_cpus, perf\_pmu\_\_find\_hybrid\_pmu
should return NULL,both events\_nr and unmatched\_count should be 0 ,then
the cpu list check function evlist\_\_fix\_hybrid\_cpus return -1 and the
error "failed to use cpu list 0" will happen. Bypass "events\_nr=0" case
then the issue is fixed.
After:
# perf stat -C0 -e uncore\_clock/clockticks/ sleep 1
Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0':
195,476,873 uncore\_clock/clockticks/
1.004518677 seconds time elapsed
When testing with at least one core event and uncore events, it has no
issue.

A broken device may give an extreme offset like 0xFFF0
and a reasonable length for a fragment. In the sanity
check as formulated now, this will create an integer
overflow, defeating the sanity check. Both offset
and offset + len need to be checked in such a manner
that no overflow can occur.
And those quantities should be unsigned.

drm/i915: Fix bw atomic check when switching between SAGV vs. no SAGV
commit ec663bca9128f13eada25cd0446e7fcb5fcdc088 upstream.
If the only thing that is changing is SAGV vs. no SAGV but
the number of active planes and the total data rates end up
unchanged we currently bail out of intel\_bw\_atomic\_check()
early and forget to actually compute the new WGV point
mask and thus won't actually enable/disable SAGV as requested.
This ends up poorly if we end up running with SAGV enabled
when we shouldn't. Usually ends up in underruns.
To fix this let's go through the QGV point mask computation
if either the data rates/number of planes, or the state
of SAGV is changing.
v2: Check more carefully if things are changing to avoid
the extra calculations/debugs from introducing unwanted
overhead

drm/i915: Disconnect PHYs left connected by BIOS on disabled ports
commit a40ee54e9a0958406469d46def03eec62aea0b69 upstream.
BIOS may leave a TypeC PHY in a connected state even though the
corresponding port is disabled. This will prevent any hotplug events
from being signalled (after the monitor deasserts and then reasserts its
HPD) until the PHY is disconnected and so the driver will not detect a
connected sink. Rebooting with the PHY in the connected state also
results in a system hang.
Fix the above by disconnecting TypeC PHYs on disabled ports.
Before commit 64851a32c463e5 the PHY connected state was read out even
for disabled ports and later the PHY got disconnected as a side effect
of a tc\_port\_lock/unlock() sequence (during connector probing), hence
recovering the port's hotplug functionality.

drm/amd/display: Fix stream->link\_enc unassigned during stream removal
commit 3743e7f6fcb938b7d8b7967e6a9442805e269b3d upstream.
[Why]
Found when running igt@kms\_atomic.
Userspace attempts to do a TEST\_COMMIT when 0 streams which calls
dc\_remove\_stream\_from\_ctx. This in turn calls link\_enc\_unassign
which ends up modifying stream->link = NULL directly, causing the
global link\_enc to be removed preventing further link activity
and future link validation from passing.
[How]
We take care of link\_enc unassignment at the start of
link\_enc\_cfg\_link\_encs\_assign so this call is no longer necessary.
Fixes global state from being modified while unlocked.

KVM: x86/mmu: make apf token non-zero to fix bug
commit 6f3c1fc53d86d580d8d6d749c4af23705e4f6f79 upstream.
In current async pagefault logic, when a page is ready, KVM relies on
kvm\_arch\_can\_dequeue\_async\_page\_present() to determine whether to deliver
a READY event to the Guest. This function test token value of struct
kvm\_vcpu\_pv\_apf\_data, which must be reset to zero by Guest kernel when a
READY event is finished by Guest. If value is zero meaning that a READY
event is done, so the KVM can deliver another.
But the kvm\_arch\_setup\_async\_pf() may produce a valid token with zero
value, which is confused with previous mention and may lead the loss of
this READY event.
This bug may cause task blocked forever in Guest:
INFO: task stress:7532 blocked for more than 1254 seconds.

parisc/unaligned: Fix fldd and fstd unaligned handlers on 32-bit kernel
commit dd2288f4a020d693360e3e8d72f8b9d9c25f5ef6 upstream.
Usually the kernel provides fixup routines to emulate the fldd and fstd
floating-point instructions if they load or store 8-byte from/to a not
natuarally aligned memory location.
On a 32-bit kernel I noticed that those unaligned handlers didn't worked and
instead the application got a SEGV.
While checking the code I found two problems:
First, the OPCODE\_FLDD\_L and OPCODE\_FSTD\_L cases were ifdef'ed out by the
CONFIG\_PA20 option, and as such those weren't built on a pure 32-bit kernel.
This is now fixed by moving the CONFIG\_PA20 #ifdef to prevent the compilation
of OPCODE\_LDD\_L and OPCODE\_FSTD\_L only, and handling the fldd and fstd
instructions.
The second problem are two bugs in the 32-bit inline assembly code, where the
wrong registers where used. The calculation of the natural alignment used %2
(vall) instead of %3 (ior), and the first word was stored back to address %1
(valh) instead of %3 (ior).

vhost/vsock: don't check owner in vhost\_vsock\_stop() while releasing
commit a58da53ffd70294ebea8ecd0eb45fd0d74add9f9 upstream.
vhost\_vsock\_stop() calls vhost\_dev\_check\_owner() to check the device
ownership. It expects current->mm to be valid.
vhost\_vsock\_stop() is also called by vhost\_vsock\_dev\_release() when
the user has not done close(), so when we are in do\_exit(). In this
case current->mm is invalid and we're releasing the device, so we
should clean it anyway.
Let's check the owner only when vhost\_vsock\_stop() is called
by an ioctl.
When invoked from release we can not fail so we don't check return
code of vhost\_vsock\_stop(). We need to stop vsock even if it's not
the owner.

io\_uring: disallow modification of rsrc\_data during quiesce
commit 80912cef18f16f8fe59d1fb9548d4364342be360 upstream.
io\_rsrc\_ref\_quiesce will unlock the uring while it waits for references to
the io\_rsrc\_data to be killed.
There are other places to the data that might add references to data via
calls to io\_rsrc\_node\_switch.
There is a race condition where this reference can be added after the
completion has been signalled. At this point the io\_rsrc\_ref\_quiesce call
will wake up and relock the uring, assuming the data is unused and can be
freed - although it is actually being used.
To fix this check in io\_rsrc\_ref\_quiesce if a resource has been revived.

slab: remove \_\_alloc\_size attribute from \_\_kmalloc\_track\_caller
commit 93dd04ab0b2b32ae6e70284afc764c577156658e upstream.
Commit c37495d6254c ("slab: add \_\_alloc\_size attributes for better
bounds checking") added \_\_alloc\_size attributes to a bunch of kmalloc
function prototypes. Unfortunately the change to \_\_kmalloc\_track\_caller
seems to cause clang to generate broken code and the first time this is
called when booting, the box will crash.
While the compiler problems are being reworked and attempted to be
solved [1], let's just drop the attribute to solve the issue now. Once
it is resolved it can be added back.

The corrupted leaf of device tree has an inode item. The leaf passed
checksum and others checks in validate\_extent\_buffer until check\_leaf\_item().
Because of the key type BTRFS\_INODE\_ITEM, check\_inode\_item() is called even we
are in the device tree. Since the
item offset + sizeof(struct btrfs\_inode\_item) > eb->len, out-of-bounds access
is triggered.
The item end vs leaf boundary check has been done before
check\_leaf\_item(), so fix it by checking item size in check\_inode\_item()
before access of the inode item in extent buffer.
Other check functions except check\_dev\_item() in check\_leaf\_item()
have their item size checks.
The commit for check\_dev\_item() is followed.
No regression observed during running fstests.

cgroup-v1: Correct privileges check in release\_agent writes
commit 467a726b754f474936980da793b4ff2ec3e382a7 upstream.
The idea is to check: a) the owning user\_ns of cgroup\_ns, b)
capabilities in init\_user\_ns.
The commit 24f600856418 ("cgroup-v1: Require capabilities to set
release\_agent") got this wrong in the write handler of release\_agent
since it checked user\_ns of the opener (may be different from the owning
user\_ns of cgroup\_ns).
Secondly, to avoid possibly confused deputy, the capability of the
opener must be checked.

cgroup/cpuset: Fix a race between cpuset\_attach() and cpu hotplug
commit 05c7b7a92cc87ff8d7fde189d0fade250697573c upstream.
As previously discussed(https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/1/20/51),
cpuset\_attach() is affected with similar cpu hotplug race,
as follow scenario:
cpuset\_attach() cpu hotplug
--------------------------- ----------------------
down\_write(cpuset\_rwsem)
guarantee\_online\_cpus() // (load cpus\_attach)
sched\_cpu\_deactivate
set\_cpu\_active()
// will change cpu\_active\_mask
set\_cpus\_allowed\_ptr(cpus\_attach)
\_\_set\_cpus\_allowed\_ptr\_locked()
// (if the intersection of cpus\_attach and
cpu\_active\_mask is empty, will return -EINVAL)
up\_write(cpuset\_rwsem)
To avoid races such as described above, protect cpuset\_attach() call
with cpu\_hotplug\_lock.

mm/filemap: Fix handling of THPs in generic\_file\_buffered\_read()
When a THP is present in the page cache, we can return it several times,
leading to userspace seeing the same data repeatedly if doing a read()
that crosses a 64-page boundary. This is probably not a security issue
(since the data all comes from the same file), but it can be interpreted
as a transient data corruption issue. Fortunately, it is very rare as
it can only occur when CONFIG\_READ\_ONLY\_THP\_FOR\_FS is enabled, and it can
only happen to executables. We don't often call read() on executables.
This bug is fixed differently in v5.17 by commit 6b24ca4a1a8d
("mm: Use multi-index entries in the page cache"). That commit is
unsuitable for backporting, so fix this in the clearest way. It
sacrifices a little performance for clarity, but this should never
be a performance path in these kernel versions.
