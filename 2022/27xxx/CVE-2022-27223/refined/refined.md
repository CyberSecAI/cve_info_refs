{
  "CVE-2022-27223": {
    "Description": "A flaw was discovered in the udc-xilinx USB gadget-mode controller driver. On systems using this driver, a malicious USB host could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the endpoint index in the udc-xilinx USB gadget-mode controller driver. A malicious USB host can manipulate this index to point past the endpoint array, which could result in memory corruption or denial of service.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service, memory corruption, or possibly arbitrary code execution on systems using the affected driver.",
     "Attack vectors": "A malicious USB host can manipulate the endpoint index during USB communication.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to act as a USB host and send crafted USB requests to the target device using the vulnerable driver."
