# Onapsis Security Advisory 2022-0007: Directory Traversal vulnerability in
SAP Focused Run (Simple Diagnostics Agent 1.0)

## Impact on Business

Exposing the contents of a directory can lead to a disclosure of useful
information
for the attacker to devise exploits, such as creation times of files or any
information that may be encoded in file names. The directory listing may
also
compromise private or confidential data.

## Advisory Information

- Public Release Date: 06/21/2022
- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2022-0007
- Researcher(s): Yvan Genuer

## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:
  - SIMPLE\_DIAGNOSTICS\_AGENT 1.0

  (Check SAP Note 3159091 for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: CWE-548
- CVSS v3 score: 2.7 AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
- Risk Level: Low
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2022-27657
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 3159091

## Affected Components Description

SAP Focused Run is a spin-off from SAP Solution Manager concentrating on the
specific needs of high volume system and application monitoring, alerting

analytics needs.
(<https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-focused-run/expert-portal/>)

## Vulnerability Details

A path traversal exists in the Simple Diagnostic Agent service listening, by
default, on localhost port 3005. A local attacker, without particular
privileges,
can use it to display content of the directory as ```sapadm``` OS user.
Leading to
information disclosure of potentially sensitive data.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 3159091 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from

## SAP Security Patch Day

The security maintenance of installed SAP software is key to continuously protect also against new types of attacks or newly identified potential weaknesses.

Based on feedback from customers, partners and SAP user groups, SAP has launched a regular **SAP Security Patch Day**, scheduled for the **second Tuesday of every month** — which has been synchronized with the Security Patch Day of other major software vendors.

On these SAP Patch Days, SAP publishes software corrections as **SAP Security Notes**, focused solely on security to protect against potential weaknesses or attacks. Access [SAP Security Notes in SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/app/securitynotes), then select *All Security Notes*, to get the complete list of all SAP Security Notes. **We recommend that you implement these corrections at a priority**. Several tools are available to help identify, select and implement these corrections.

SAP categorizes SAP Security Notes as *Patch Day Security Not*es and *Support Package Security Notes*, with the sole purpose of making you focus on important fixes on patch days and the rest to be implemented automatically during SP upgrades. For details refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html). Security fixes for SAP NetWeaver based products are also delivered with the support packages.

Starting June 11, 2019, for all new SAP Security Notes with high or very high severity we deliver fix for Support Packages shipped within the last 24 months\* for the versions under Mainstream Maintenance and Extended Maintenance. This is extended from the previous Support Package coverage of 18 months.

Notes with low or medium priority contain corrections in at least the newest support package in all mainstream and extended maintenance releases.

\*For information on areas with an exception from the 24 months maintenance strategy, refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html?anchorId=section_237298869 "exceptions").
