Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-27386

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of a specific SQL query involving a combination of `GROUP BY`, `DEFAULT`, `HEX`, and subqueries.
- A crash occurs in `Query_arena::set_query_arena` function, specifically when handling the default value of a field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect memory handling:** The `Query_arena::set_query_arena` function is called with a null pointer (`set=0x0`) which leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV) and crash.
- **Complex query processing:** The vulnerability is exposed when processing a particular combination of SQL operations which leads to memory management issues
- **Data type handling issue:** Specifically triggered during default value assignment to a `TIMESTAMP` column while inside of a group by query

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a server crash, which disrupts database service availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious SQL query:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted SQL query to the database server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to execute SQL queries:** The attacker must be able to connect to the database and execute SQL statements.

**More Details:**
- The provided stack trace reveals that the crash occurs within the `sql/sql_class.cc` file during the execution of `Query_arena::set_query_arena` at line 3832, and the function `Field::set_default` located in `sql/field.cc` at line 2591.
- The problematic SQL query involves operations such as creating a table with specific data types (`DATE`, `TIME`, `YEAR`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`), using `SELECT` to insert data, creating a `SAVEPOINT`, using `DEFAULT` values, using `GROUP BY`, and using `HEX`. The complexity of these operations within a single query leads to the crash.
- The vulnerability is related to how MariaDB handles query arenas during the execution of complex SQL queries which lead to an invalid null pointer access and thus crash of the server.
- The issue is a duplicate of MDEV-21028 which also involved crashes when running SELECT statements from views.

**Additional Notes:**

- The NetApp advisory indicates the vulnerability is exploitable remotely and has a high severity score (7.5) according to CVSS v3.1.
- The provided Debian security update indicates that it is fixed in `mariadb-10.3.36-0+deb10u1`.
