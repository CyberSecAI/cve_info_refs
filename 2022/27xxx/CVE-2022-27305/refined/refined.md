**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-27305

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a session fixation issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Session Fixation (CWE-384):** The core issue is that the application does not properly regenerate session IDs upon successful login. This allows an attacker to potentially fix a user's session ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by pre-setting a session ID and then tricking the user into logging in, using that ID.
*   This could give the attacker unauthorized access to the user's account and its functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker could craft a malicious link or use other methods to trick a user into using a specific session ID before the user logs into the system.
*   The user may not notice that they are using a pre-set session ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the session ID used by a victim. This can be done remotely through various social engineering attacks or other methods.
*   No special privileges on the server are needed; the attacker must manipulate the user into using a known session ID.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Gibbon prior to v23.0.02.
*   Patches are available for versions v22.0.01 and v21.0.01.
*   The vulnerability was reported by a security researcher, Kole Swesey.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a "Moderate" severity.
