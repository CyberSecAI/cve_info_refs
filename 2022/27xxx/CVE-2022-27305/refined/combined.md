# Session Vulnerability in Gibbon Core

Moderate

[SKuipers](/SKuipers)
published
GHSA-4mq5-8jvh-qq3p
Mar 25, 2022

## Package

Gibbon Core
(PHP)

## Affected versions

< v23.0.02

## Patched versions

v23.0.02

## Description

In March 2022 the Gibbon team were alerted to a security vulnerability in the Gibbon Core. We have worked to identify and verify the fix and create a patch release of Gibbon, [v23.0.02](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/releases/tag/v23.0.02).

### Impact

This advisory pertains to a session fixation vulnerability identified in the Gibbon Core for all versions of Gibbon prior to v23.0.02.

* Vulnerability Type. Session Fixation [CWE-384](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/384.html) (Moderate Severity)
* Affected Versions: All versions prior to Gibbon [v23.0.02](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/releases/tag/v23.0.02)
* Risk Assessment. To the best of our knowledge the vulnerability has not been exploited. However, we feel it is important enough for system administrators to update sooner rather than waiting for the next version of Gibbon.

### Risk Mitigation

This vulnerability has been fixed in the [v23.0.02](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/releases/tag/v23.0.02) release [Ga Yau (Security Update)](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/releases/tag/v23.0.02). System administrators can secure their system by updating to this latest version of Gibbon following the [update instructions](https://docs.gibbonedu.org/administrators/getting-started/updating-gibbon/).

Installations running the cutting edge code should be sure to update to the latest commit of [v24.0.00](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/tree/v24.0.00).

### Patches

Installations running a version of Gibbon prior to v23 are recommended to update their system. If an update is not possible, we have prepared patches for the following versions, which can be applied by replacing the login.php file in the Gibbon root directory.

* Patch for [v22.0.01](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/releases/download/v23.0.02/Patch-v22.0.01.zip)
* Patch for [v21.0.01](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/releases/download/v23.0.02/Patch-v21.0.01.zip)

### Acknowledgement

We would like to thank Kole Swesey, the security researcher who brought this vulnerability to our attention. We have collaborated with them to verify the fix and follow responsible disclosure practices.

### References

Information about our security policy can be found on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/security/policy), including our commitment to following best practices for software security releases and disclosure.
