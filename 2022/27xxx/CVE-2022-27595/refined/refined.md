- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure library loading.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The QVPN Device Client for Windows is vulnerable to insecure library loading, which allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable QVPN client application.
- **Attack vectors**: Local authenticated users are the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local authenticated user.
