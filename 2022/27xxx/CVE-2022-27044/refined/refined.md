- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow occurs due to an out-of-bounds write in the `error_diffuse` function within `quant.c`. Specifically, an incorrect calculation when handling image boundaries in the diffusion process leads to accessing memory outside the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The out-of-bounds write corrupts heap memory, leading to program crashes. Further exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution if the overwritten heap data is carefully crafted.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted image file using the `img2sixel` tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malicious image file to the `img2sixel` tool. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
