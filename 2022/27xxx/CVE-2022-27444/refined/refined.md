Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27444:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability occurs when using a `HAVING` clause with a `NOT EXISTS` predicate in an equality comparison within a specific SQL query structure. Specifically, the issue arises during query optimization when an equality is merged with the HAVING clause. This can lead to an attempt to access an invalid memory location, triggering a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-  **Incorrect handling of subqueries with `NOT EXISTS`:** The vulnerability stems from an improper handling of subqueries within the `HAVING` clause, specifically involving `NOT EXISTS`.
-   **Memory access violation:**  The vulnerability results in a crash due to an attempt to access invalid memory during the merge of the equality condition, suggesting a possible memory corruption issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a server crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Malicious SQL query:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific SQL query containing the problematic `HAVING` clause with a `NOT EXISTS` predicate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Ability to execute SQL queries:** An attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against a vulnerable MariaDB instance. This could involve having direct access to the database, or via an application that constructs and sends database queries.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided Jira issue includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) query that triggers the crash.
- The vulnerability is present in MariaDB versions 10.9.0, 10.4 (EOL), 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 (EOL), and 10.8 (EOL).
- Fixes have been released in versions 10.4.25, 10.5.16, 10.6.8, and 10.7.4.
- The vulnerability is related to the optimizer component of MariaDB.
- NetApp has acknowledged the vulnerability and its potential impact on NetApp products that incorporate MariaDB, although their listed products were not affected by the specific vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS score of 7.5 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, meaning it can be triggered remotely without any prior privilege or user interaction, resulting in a loss of availability,
