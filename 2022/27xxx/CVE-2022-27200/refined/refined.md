Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27200:

**CVE-2022-27200**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Plugin:** Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.3 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not properly escape the names of roles shown on the configuration form. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts through role names.
*   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization/escaping of user-controlled data in the role names displayed on the configuration form
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers, leading to actions like session hijacking, defacement, or data theft.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker with `Overall/Administer` permission configures the plugin by creating a role with a malicious script in its name.
    2. When other users with `Overall/Administer` access the configuration form, the malicious script embedded in the role name will be executed in their browser.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have `Overall/Administer` permission to configure the plugin and create/modify roles.
*   **Fix:** Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin version 1.4 escapes the names of roles shown on the configuration form, preventing the XSS.
