# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @Wardormeur **[Wardormeur](/Wardormeur)** commented [Feb 18, 2022](#issue-1142862123)

Due to the concatenation of domains, it's possible to spoof the information into something unexpected, leading essentially to a Server Side Request Forgery.

Instead of validating the api-key format, which could change and could be escaped by playing cat/mouse game around allowed characters/encoding, I've preferred relying on the Ruby parsing of URL post-creation to ensure that the end result is what we expect.

The error itself is not very self-explanatory, happy to change it if you have a better idea :)

Cheers

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I don’t believe the fix completely resolves the issue, since the use of `include` ([api\_request.rb](https://github.com/amro/gibbon/blob/b2eb99ed304d7491a6d348a5bbdc83a008fc6e0b/lib/gibbon/api_request.rb#L196-L197)) is not sufficient to prevent the injection of arbitrary hostnames. An attacker could still inject a FQDN containing `api.mailchimp.com` as a subdomain. The `end_with?` String class method should be used instead.  ``` 2.6.3 :001 > computed_api_endpoint = "https://foe.api.mailchimp.com.attacker.com/?api.mailchimp.com"  => "https://foe.api.mailchimp.com.attacker.com/?api.mailchimp.com"  2.6.3 :002 > URI(computed_api_endpoint).host  => "foe.api.mailchimp.com.attacker.com"  2.6.3 :003 > URI(computed_api_endpoint).host.include?("api.mailchimp.com")  => true  ```  If possible, issue an advisory using the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/amro/gibbon/security/advisories) feature on the repository. |

| Thanks for this. Glad to hear it's not a threat when the API key is static.  I agree the `end_with?` option suggested should work. [@amro](https://github.com/amro) I see you've implemented a check on the input value in [cade20c](https://github.com/amro/gibbon/commit/cade20ca2438cd1b182dad70cbb77fb895779d10) so it seems that `3.4.4` should be protected entirely; is that right?  The current [GitHub advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vx9g-377x-xwxq) states;  A partial fix has been introduced in version 3.4.4, however a complete fix has not yet been created  Thanks for all your efforts maintaining this gem! 👍  For reference, this vulnerability is tracked as;   * [CVE-2022-27311](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27311) * [GHSA-vx9g-377x-xwxq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vx9g-377x-xwxq "GHSA-vx9g-377x-xwxq") |
