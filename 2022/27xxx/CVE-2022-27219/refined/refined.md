- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SINEMA Remote Connect Server is missing HTTP security headers on the web server. Specifically, the web server configured on ports 443 and 6220 is missing these headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing HTTP security headers, which can lead to vulnerabilities like clickjacking and channel downgrade attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could exploit the missing headers to perform client-based attacks, such as clickjacking and channel downgrade attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N). Attackers can exploit this remotely by interacting with the affected web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N) but needs user interaction (UI:R) to be successful, as they need to trick the user into performing actions on the web server due to the missing headers. The attack complexity is high (AC:H) indicating that the attacker would need to prepare the attack.
