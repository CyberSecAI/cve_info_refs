- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Simcenter Femap when parsing specially crafted .NEU files. The vulnerability occurs due to the application writing past the end of an allocated memory structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads specially crafted .NEU files. An attacker could trick a user into opening such a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious .NEU file and convince a user to open the file using the vulnerable application. The attack vector is local, but requires user interaction.
