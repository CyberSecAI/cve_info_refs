  "CVE-2022-27650": {
    "Description": "A bug was found in `crun` where `crun exec` by default created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2).\n\nThis bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `crun exec` command was incorrectly setting inheritable Linux process capabilities by default.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect default inheritable capabilities for linux containers"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with access to programs with inheritable file capabilities could elevate those capabilities to the permitted set when execve(2) runs. This allows an attacker to create a malicious nsenter binary which provides erroneous results to podman top, make syscalls, and other operations beyond what is normally allowed for the container.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By publishing a malicious image to a public registry",
      "By executing programs with inheritable file capabilities"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to publish a malicious image to a registry",
      "Access to programs with inheritable file capabilities"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was fixed in `crun` version 1.4.4. Affected Red Hat products include various versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and OpenShift Container Platform."
