- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the HTTPd CLI console. The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient CSRF protection for commands executed via GET requests in the CLI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF (CWE-352). The lack of proper CSRF protection allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into executing malicious CLI commands via crafted GET requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands on the vulnerable system. This may lead to a variety of impacts, potentially including unauthorized configuration changes, information disclosure, or denial of service, depending on the specific command executed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based and involves tricking an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious link or loading a webpage that triggers a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable device's CLI. The attacker needs to lure the user into making a GET request to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URLs to a logged-in administrator of the affected devices. The attacker needs no prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability itself but requires that an administrator be logged into the device for the attack to be successful. The attacker can be remote from the vulnerable system.
