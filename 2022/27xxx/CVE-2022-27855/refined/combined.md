## Description

**This Plugin Will No Longer Work With Google Analytics on July 1, 2023**

> Google Analytics 4, is replacing Universal Analytics. On July 1, 2023, standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new data. This means that any Universal Analytics data that you’re using in Google Ads campaigns will start to degrade and your ad performance may be impacted. We strongly recommend that you make the switch to [Google Analytics 4](https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-conversion-pixel/) as soon as possible.

Analytics Cat – Google Analytics is a lean, fast, simple, no-frills way to add your Google Analytics / Universal Google Analytics code to your WordPress site.

This bloat-free, simple Google Analytics WordPress plugin doesn’t add tons of features. Instead, Analytics Cat – Google Analytics simply focuses on letting you add your Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) Code to your site in less than 2 minutes, without slowing your site down.

#### Which features does Analytics Cat – Google Analytics have?

* Add the Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) tracking code to your WordPress site with ease.
* Hide your Google Analytics tracking code from logged-in users so you don’t pollute your data.

#### How to use Analytics Cat – Google Analytics?

There are multiple ways to add the Google Analytics tracking code to your WordPress site.

**1. Pasting your Google Analytics script into your theme**

This approach isn’t great for two reasons:

a) If you edit your live site and make a mistake when pasting your Google Analytics script into your theme, you could take down your website.

b) If your theme is updated with new features or security fixes, your Google Analytics code will be overwritten.

**2. Pasting your Google Analytics script into a header/footer script plugin**

This is a valid approach, but has some disadvantages. General purposes “header script plugins” aren’t built from the ground-up to support Google Analytics.

What this means is that :

a) These plugins lack Google Analytics-specific functionality.

b) These plugins will not adapt if Google Analytics changes again. Since Analytics Cat is a dedicated Google Analytics WordPress plugin, we’ll make sure make sure to stay compatible with future changes to Google Analytics.

c) These plugins usually don’t support hiding your Google Analytics code from logged-in users.

**3. Using Some Other Google Analytics WordPress Plugin**

There are some good Google Analytics plugins out there, but many of them are bloated, have too many settings and are slow.

You’ll love Analytics Cat – Google Analytics Cat iff what you want is a simple, reliable Google Analytics plugin,

#### Does Analytics Cat – Google Analytics Plugin work with Universal Analytics?

Yes. Analytics Cat is built from the ground up to support Universal Analytics.

Analytics Cat – Google Analytics does not work with the old Google Analytics script that Google deprecated.

#### Can I hide my Google Analytics tracking code from logged in users?

Yes. You can hide your Google Analytics code from logged in users by going to Settings -> Google Analytics Manager.

#### Is Analytics Cat – Google Analytics easy to translate?

Yes. Analytics Cat – Google Analytics Cat is fully translateable. Please let us know if you’re interested in contributing.

#### Analytics Cat – Google Analytics Feature Roadmap

This is just the first version of Analytics Cat – we have tons of new features & improvements lined up. Do you have any suggestions? Please leave a comment in the support forums.

##### 4.7

### Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

This could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

This security issue has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
