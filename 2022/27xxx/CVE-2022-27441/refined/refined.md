The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the TPCMS v3.2 management system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when saving user-provided data within the TPCMS system. Specifically, the "Bottom Information" or "Phone" fields under "System Settings" -> "Site Configuration" do not sanitize the input, which allows arbitrary JavaScript code to be stored.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The injected malicious script is stored within the system's database.
- **Lack of input sanitization/validation:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, which leads to the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** When a user visits the front-site, the stored malicious JavaScript code is executed in their browser.
- **Session hijacking:** The attacker can steal user session cookies.
- **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect the user to a phishing site to steal credentials
- **Data exfiltration:**  Sensitive data can be exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Website defacement:** The attacker can alter the content of the website
- **Malware distribution:** The attacker can redirect the victim to a page hosting malware

**Attack vectors:**
- **Admin access:** The attacker needs to log in to the TPCMS management system with administrator privileges (username/password: admin/admin888).
- **Vulnerable input fields:** The attacker needs to inject the XSS payload in the "Bottom Information" or "Phone" fields under "System Settings" -> "Site Configuration".
- **Front-end visit:** Once the payload is stored, a user visiting the website front-end will trigger the execution of the XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator access to the TPCMS management system.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable input fields within the system configuration.
