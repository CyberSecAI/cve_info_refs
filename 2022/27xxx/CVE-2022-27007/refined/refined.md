{
  "CVE-2022-27007": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of function frames in njs_function_frame_save() and njs_function_frame_alloc() during asynchronous operations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to saving pointers to spare memory of the original frame which may be already free when the saved frame is restored."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through the use of `await` instructions in JavaScript code which calls the vulnerable frame allocation logic.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code that uses the `await` keyword and can trigger the vulnerable code paths by causing recursive asynchronous calls."
  }
