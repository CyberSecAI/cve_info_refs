- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zero-channel BBS Plus bulletin board CGI script has a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user accessing the management screen. This can lead to the creation of a management account, allowing a remote attacker to view sender information, change settings, and edit/delete posts on the bulletin board.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a user accessing the management screen of the application. The specific method of injecting the malicious script is not specified, but it's assumed to be through user-controlled input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious script that will be executed in the context of a user's browser when they access the management screen. No specific privileges or authentication is mentioned for the attacker, implying the attack may be possible without prior access. The user needs to interact with the injected script for it to be executed in their browser.
