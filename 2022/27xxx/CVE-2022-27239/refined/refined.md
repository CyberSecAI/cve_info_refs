{
  "CVE-2022-27239": {
    "Description": "In cifs-utils through 6.14, a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the mount.cifs ip= command-line argument could lead to local attackers gaining root privileges.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when parsing the mount.cifs ip= command-line argument due to an insufficient length check prior to copying the argument's value into a fixed-size buffer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local attackers can gain root privileges by exploiting the buffer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via the `mount.cifs` command-line argument `ip=`",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user to execute the `mount.cifs` command, and specify an overly long string as a value to `ip=` argument."
