# Security Advisory – CVE-2022-27905

This document addresses Privilege Escalation vulnerability (CVE-2022-27905) in the Controlup Real-Time Agent.

       **Vulnerability ID:** CVE-2022-27905
 **Severity:** Medium
 **Update Release Date:** February 17, 2022
 **Fix version:** Version >= 8.6 for both Hybrid Cloud and COP (On-Premises)
#### What was the problem?

A local privilege escalation may be possible due to an insecure call to the CreateProcessAsUserA (Unquoted path) WinAPI function while the ControlUp Real-Time Agent is running.
The prerequisites for exploiting this vulnerability are very uncommon and include write access to C:\ by a low-privilege user and the ability to restart the cuAgent service.

#### Solution

We advise you to do the following:

* Upgrade to the latest 8.6 version of ControlUp (Hybrid Cloud and On-Premises).
* Deploy the latest ControlUp Real-Time Agent to all endpoints.

It is important to update/uninstall all ControlUp Real-Time Agents even if they are no longer in use. You can watch this [2-minute video](https://youtu.be/3Z-iWOmt07k) to learn how to easily find machines with older ControlUp Real-Time Agent versions.
