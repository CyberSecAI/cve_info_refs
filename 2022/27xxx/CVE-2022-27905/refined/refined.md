- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ControlUp Real-Time Agent uses an insecure call to the `CreateProcessAsUserA` WinAPI function with an unquoted path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted path vulnerability in the `CreateProcessAsUserA` function call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: A low-privilege user needs to have write access to `C:\` and be able to restart the `cuAgent` service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access with low privileges, write access to the root directory `C:\`, and the ability to restart the `cuAgent` service.
