Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability addressed by CVE-2022-27920:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper encoding of the `searchURL` parameter within the `searchSuggestionHtml` functionality of the Kiwix library's built-in web server. Specifically, the `searchURL` was not encoded before being passed to  `searchSuggestionHtml`, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious HTML code into the `searchURL`, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser when they interact with the Kiwix web server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Encoding:** The root cause is the absence of proper input sanitization or URL encoding before including the `searchURL` in the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation would enable an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript in a user's browser. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the displayed page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive information
- **Compromise of User Data:** Depending on the user's environment and browser, this could potentially expose user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL, where the `searchURL` parameter contains malicious HTML, typically an `<svg>` tag with an `onload` event to trigger JavaScript execution.
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML code via the search URL in the request to the Kiwix webserver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious `searchURL` parameter.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to access this malicious URL using the Kiwix built-in webserver functionality

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `a59787002510a52171684487a10562d8d096c421`, which was included in version 10.0.0 of libkiwix.
- The fix involves URL encoding the `searchURL` before passing it to `searchSuggestionHtml`.
- The vulnerability is present in the `internalServer.cpp` file, specifically in how it constructs the search suggestion HTML.
