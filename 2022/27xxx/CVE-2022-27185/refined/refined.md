- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `confctl_set_master_wlan` function in the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi firmware does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied data within protobuf messages. Specifically, it takes the SSID and password from the protobuf directly and sets the device's Wi-Fi configuration without authentication or proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284). The device does not require authentication for changing wireless settings via protobuf messages sent to port 9003.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve a denial-of-service condition by sending specially crafted network packets to the device, which causes it to malfunction and disrupt the Wi-Fi network. Moreover, by changing the SSID and password via crafted packets, an attacker can also perform a man-in-the-middle attack by creating a rogue Wi-Fi network, and potentially gain unauthorized access to devices connected to this network.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted protobuf messages to port 9003 of the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network (Wi-Fi or wired) as the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to send malicious packets.
