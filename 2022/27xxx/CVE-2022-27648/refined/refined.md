```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of SCA2 files due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a target to open a malicious SCA2 file or visit a malicious page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to deliver a malicious SCA2 file or a webpage containing a crafted exploit to the victim. User interaction is required, meaning that the target user has to open the malicious file or visit the malicious page."
