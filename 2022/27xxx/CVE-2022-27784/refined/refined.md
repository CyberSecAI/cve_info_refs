- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-121) exists in Adobe After Effects.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), and user interaction is required (UI:R). It does not require any privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to convince a user to open a malicious file crafted to trigger the buffer overflow.
