- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Python format string vulnerability exists in the self-service permissions update workflow of ConsoleMe. User input is directly used in a format string evaluation, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input and uses it unsafely in string formatting, specifically Python's format string mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Information disclosure: Attackers can use format string specifiers to access and disclose sensitive information available via field accesses.
    - Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE): While not directly possible through the mini-language, there is a possibility that attribute-access side effects could lead to arbitrary code execution. This could lead to the retrieval of on-instance AWS credentials.
    - Privilege Escalation: Gaining access to AWS credentials via ConsoleMe can provide access to other AWS IAM roles belonging to the owner of the ConsoleMe installation.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with authenticated access to ConsoleMe can exploit the vulnerability via the self-service permissions update workflow by crafting malicious format string payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the ConsoleMe application to trigger the vulnerable code path.
