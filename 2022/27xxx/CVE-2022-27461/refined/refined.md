- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `returnUrl` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open Redirect
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites after they have logged in, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted URL with a malicious `returnUrl` parameter. For example: `https://<IP>/login?returnurl=https://example.com`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a crafted link and lure the victim to click on it after a successful login. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
