This plugin is awesome.
Here the full content is being restricted. It was great if the content before the <!–more–> tag was visible to viewers and only the content after the <!–more–> tag was restricted.
This plugin is great for monetizing your website of any type and for any purpose. I am happy with this plugin.
\*Just try this plugin. You will love it.

After activating this, my website had a critical error. I couldn’t access my admin or the front end of the site. Catastrophic!!! I’ll avoid any plugin from videowhisper.

This plugin has allowed me to easily create a wallet system for my website, where people can buy credit and use it to donate to each other for their content. I had been looking for something like this, and this has been a fantastic solution.
It can be used to donate to any post type, I integrate it with other plugins and use it for blog posts, events and courses. Integrates with Woo Commerce and Tera Wallet, and can all be used for free.
The support has been great, I have always had quick responses and the team as followed up with me beyond expectation.
