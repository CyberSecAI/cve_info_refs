Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-27452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of SQL commands involving virtual columns, partitioning, and operations with string and numeric conversions. Specifically, the crash is triggered by a `SELECT` statement using `NOT IN` clause after a table is created with virtual columns and partitions. The virtual column definition includes complex expressions that use multiple operations involving type conversions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Crash due to unexpected code path**: A specific combination of SQL statements can lead to a crash in the MariaDB server.
*   **Type conversion errors:** The issue appears to be related to the way MariaDB handles type conversions within complex expressions, specifically when involving virtual columns and partitions.
*   **Potential for a divide by zero or similar error:**  The stack trace shows the crash originating from `Arg_comparator::compare_real()`, which may be related to invalid or unhandled input during comparison operations. The division by 'x' string in the virtual column definition may also be related.
*   **Virtual column evaluation issues:** Complex expressions involving virtual columns seem to expose underlying issues in the evaluation or comparison logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a server crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection (Indirect):** An attacker would need to craft a specific sequence of SQL commands to trigger the vulnerability. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) shows how this can be done by exploiting the specific combination of `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `SELECT` queries. This can be done from an authenticated SQL connection.
*  **Complex SQL queries**: The specific SQL statements that cause the crash include partitioning, virtual columns, and complex string/number conversions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Database User:** An attacker would require access to a MariaDB database server with privileges to execute DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) SQL statements (such as `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`).
*  **Ability to submit arbitrary SQL queries:** Attacker needs the ability to submit crafted SQL queries to the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in MariaDB version 10.9.0 but also affects other versions, requiring updates.
*   The issue has been marked as a duplicate of MDEV-24176 which indicates the problem is not unique to this specific combination of expressions but part of a broader class of related bugs in handling virtual columns.
*   NetApp products that incorporate MariaDB are potentially affected by this vulnerability.
