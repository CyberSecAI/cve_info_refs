{
  "Root cause": "Incomplete validation of incoming IXFR transfers.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "When IXFR falls back to a full zone transfer, an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle can cause the transfer to be prematurely interrupted.",
    "The interrupted transfer is mistakenly interpreted as a complete transfer, causing an incomplete zone to be processed."
  ],
  "Impact": "Denial of service. For the Authoritative Server, an incomplete transfer could lead to missing data in secondary zones. For the Recursor, an incomplete RPZ transfer results in missing policy entries, potentially causing some DNS names and IP addresses to not be properly intercepted.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attacks on the network path used for IXFR transfers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Control of the network path for IXFR transfers between the primary and secondary DNS servers, or between the RPZ server and the Recursor."
