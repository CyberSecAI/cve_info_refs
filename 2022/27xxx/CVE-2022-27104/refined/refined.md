Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in Forma LMS versions 1.4.3 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks that can be exploited without requiring prior authentication.
*   **Time-Based (Blind) SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is exploitable using a time-based blind SQL injection technique.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** A successful exploit can give an attacker access to the application's entire database.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can steal sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Overwriting:** The attacker can modify or overwrite data within the database.
*   **System Compromise:** Gaining access to the database can lead to further compromise of the system and potentially the entire infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No user credentials or prior authentication is required to initiate the attack.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable Forma LMS instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to possess any user credentials.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and interpret server responses to exploit the blind SQL injection.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Swascan's Offensive Security Team.
*   Version 1.x of Forma LMS reached its End of Support date in 2019, encouraging users to migrate to the newer 3.x versions which include updated security and code.
*   The exploit uses a Time-Based (Blind) technique, meaning the attacker needs to send a large amount of HTTP requests to extract data one character at a time, increasing the attack time.
*   The vendor was contacted, and the vulnerability was confirmed.
