| Exploit Title: SQL Injection vulnerability on cszcms\_admin\_Users\_viewUsers Date: 11-March-2022 Exploit Author: [@Limerence](https://github.com/xuehaobaobao) Software Link: <https://github.com/cskaza/cszcms/archive/refs/tags/1.2.2.zip> Version: 1.2.2  Description: SQL Injection allows an attacker to run malicious SQL statements on a database and thus being able to read or modify the data in the database. With enough privileges assigned to the database user, it can allow the attacker to delete tables or drop databases.
