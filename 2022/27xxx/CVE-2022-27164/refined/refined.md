The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the cszcms application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `viewUsers` function in `cszcms/controllers/admin/Users.php` and the `getUser` function in `cszcms/models/Csz_admin_model.php`. These functions are vulnerable because they directly incorporate user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly concatenates user input into SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can read sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials or other confidential information.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify existing data, corrupting or manipulating application state.
- **Data Deletion:** With sufficient privileges, an attacker can delete database tables or even drop entire databases, leading to data loss and application unavailability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/index.php/admin/Users/viewUsers/` with a malicious SQL payload in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The specific endpoint appears to be accessible after login to the admin section
- No special privileges or access is mentioned beyond reaching the vulnerable endpoint.
