- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information during authentication management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application transmits sensitive information in cleartext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Man-in-the-middle attackers can obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Unspecified vectors, but the vulnerability is network-based, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server (man-in-the-middle).
