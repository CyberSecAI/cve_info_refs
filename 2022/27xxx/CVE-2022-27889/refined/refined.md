- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inefficient code paths within the Multipass service that presented abusable primitives.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Susceptibility to performance degradation or denial of service when saturated with specific requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious attacker could perform an application-level denial of service attack, potentially causing authentication and/or authorization operations to fail. This could lead to performance degradation or login failures for customer Palantir Foundry environments.
- **Attack vectors**: Saturated with specific requests. Specifically, a high load of unauthenticated requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send a high volume of specific, unauthenticated requests to the Multipass service.
