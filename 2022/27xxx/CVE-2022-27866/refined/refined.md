{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A maliciously crafted TIFF file, when processed by DesignReview.exe, can cause the application to read beyond allocated memory boundaries during file parsing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds Read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "This vulnerability could lead to code execution in the context of the current process when combined with other vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious TIFF file needs to be consumed through the DesignReview.exe application.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted TIFF file to be processed by the vulnerable application. User interaction is required in that the target must open the malicious file."
