- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `dance_Lists.php_zhuan` file when processing the `id[]` parameter. The application directly uses the unsanitized `id[]` parameter in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id[]` parameter in the `dance/admin/lists/zhuan` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of data, or complete control over the database. In this specific report, the attacker was able to perform time-based blind SQL injection by using `sleep(5)`.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP POST request to `/admin.php/dance/admin/lists/zhuan` with a crafted `id[]` parameter. The attack exploits the vulnerability using the `id[]` parameter with a crafted SQL payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator. They also need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
