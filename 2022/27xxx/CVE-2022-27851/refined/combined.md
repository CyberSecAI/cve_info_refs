You can also generate Lite / Test API key from button at top of the plugin page. **Note :**  Lite / Test API only allow single font conversion.
* Use Any Font uses Font Conversion API developed by Dnesscarkey. Font conversion API helps the plugin to convert the font files in different format (woff, woff2 but not limited to) for faster loading, and multiple browser support. Plugins sends the request to Font conversion server with font files, font conversion server converts it and returns the converted files. Once the conversion is completed, font files are automatically deleted.
* We don’t store your fonts in our server neither any of your information except the API key details. Our server deletes the temporary file after the font upload is complete. Your font files are served from your own server.
* For font conversion, our plugin uses server2.dnesscarkey.org and server3.dnesscarkey.org and it is only dedicated to Use Any Font plugin.
* For Font Conversion API terms and condition. Please visit [here](https://dineshkarki.com.np/use-any-font/terms-conditions).

## FAQ

### Which font format does plugin accepts and the font size ?

Currently, we accept ttf, otf, woff, and woff2 font formats, but you only need to upload the font in one format; other necessary formats for browser compatibility are automatically generated by our font converter. Font files up to 25MB are acceptable. However, we recommend using smaller ones whenever possible, as the font file size directly affects your site’s load time.

### From where can i get the font files ?

Mostly you can download the font files from internet. There are many sites that offer fonts. One of font directory we really like is [Ultimate Fonts](https://bit.ly/2wYjOyj). They only have free fonts which are even free for commercial use. So you can install font and use in any website.

### Does it works with multiple fonts ?

Ya, it works with multiple fonts. For multiple font conversion request, you need to get the Premium Key.

### How to add font variations ?

2. Click on Font Upload button in the right side.
3. Tick enable multiple font variation option. After that you will get select box to select the font weight and style.
4. Please make sure you use the same custom font name for all the variations.

### Do i need to manually convert fonts ?

No, you don’t need to do it yourself. Just upload your font (supports most of the font format), and the plugin’s font convertor does the rest.

### Does it work with Visual Builder like Divi Builder ?

Ya, it works with any visual builder. For that you can assign class to those elements. Class name are same as font name. Also, we have full support for Divi Builder and SiteOrigin Page Builder. You can assign fonts using their font family dropdown.

Five stars for the plugin. Two stars removed because of the message that is forever branded in my Wordpress dashboard asking me to rate this app. There’s no way to remove it. Get it off my dashboard and my rating will go up. If it stays there, I’ll either find another plugin or go without.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
