| Thank you for your letter ! The Version 2.0 supports changing the plug-in address. If you want the system to download a file, you can forge an address and add your special file. You can download it directly without such complexity. The plug-in module itself has permission control. If you do not have background permission, you will not be able to download plug-ins. Thank you again for your suggestions, but I'm sorry that the plug-in function model does not require downloading the specified files, but wants to download any files that the administrator wants to download. This is the original intention of my plug-in design. Keeping the administrator account well will be everyone's responsibility. If you lose the background account, you will lose everything. … ------------------&nbsp;原始邮件&nbsp;------------------ 发件人: "Cherry-toto/jizhicms" \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*&gt;; 发送时间:&nbsp;2022年3月18日(星期五) 晚上9:33 \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*&gt;; \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*&gt;; 主题:&nbsp;[Cherry-toto/jizhicms] V1.9.5: SSRF Vulnerability (Issue [#67](https://github.com/Cherry-toto/jizhicms/issues/67)) SSRF vulnerability with echo exists in the CMS background, and attackers can use this vulnerability to scan local and Intranet ports and attack local and Intranet Jizhicms background.
