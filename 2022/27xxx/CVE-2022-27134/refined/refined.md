- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `batdappboomx` smart contract has an access control vulnerability allowing attackers to participate in the game without paying the required entry fee.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to verify if a user has paid the entry fee before participating, leading to unauthorized participation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to participate in the game without paying, allowing them to steal cryptocurrency rewards intended for legitimate players. The provided example demonstrates how the attacker's balance increases while the victim's balance is drained, resulting in a direct financial loss for the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves interacting with the vulnerable smart contract on the EOSIO blockchain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to interact with the EOSIO blockchain and deploy transactions to the vulnerable smart contract. They also need an account on the blockchain to receive the stolen funds.
