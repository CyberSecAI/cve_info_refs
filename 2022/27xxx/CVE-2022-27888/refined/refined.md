{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Foundry Issues service was logging user session tokens.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Logging of sensitive session tokens. Session tokens could allow unauthorized access to Foundry under the user context for the lifetime of the token.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "If accessed by an unauthorized party, the session tokens could allow Foundry access under the user context for the lifetime of the token (default of 10 hours).",
  "Attack vectors": "Access to the Palantir service event logs where the session tokens were being logged.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be an authorized Palantir personnel with access to the logs. For customer hosted instances, an attacker would need to have read access to the underlying filesystem where the logs are stored."
