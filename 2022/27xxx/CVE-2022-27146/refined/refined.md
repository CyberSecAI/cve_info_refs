Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `gf_isom_apple_enum_tag` function located in `isom_read.c:4347`.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of MP4 files when processing specific metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The heap buffer overflow can lead to crashes.
- It could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated and would require further investigation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file.
- The `MP4Box` tool is used to trigger the vulnerability via the command `MP4Box -frag 1 -out /dev/null poc_file`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable application (`MP4Box`).

**Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs within the function `gf_isom_apple_enum_tag` at line 4347 in `isom_read.c`, specifically when attempting to read a byte at address `0x6020000014f5`, which is outside the bounds of allocated memory.
- The memory region `[0x6020000014f0,0x6020000014f5)` of size 5 bytes was allocated via `malloc`, and the overflow occurs at offset 0.
- The call stack provided shows the path to the vulnerable function, originating from `isom_read.c:4347` and going through various parsing and loading routines related to ISO media files (`isoffin_load.c`, `isoffin_read.c`, `filter.c`, `filter_session.c`, `isom_tools.c`, and `main.c`).
- The `AddressSanitizer` output clearly indicates a heap-buffer-overflow.
- The issue is located in the `gpac` project.

This detailed information is extracted from the provided content and describes a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in `gpac`'s `MP4Box` tool.
