Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-27463

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an open redirect. The code in `objects/login.json.php` was not properly validating the `redirectUri` parameter provided by the user during login. Specifically, it was using a regex to check if the redirect URI started with the website's root URL but did not ensure the entire domain was the same, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that would redirect to an external site while still appearing to start with the valid domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, where the application redirects the user to a URL specified in a request parameter without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker could craft a malicious login URL with a redirect to a phishing site that mimics the legitimate login page, leading users to enter their credentials on the fake site.
- **Malware Distribution:**  Attackers could redirect users to sites hosting malware or other malicious content.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers can manipulate the redirect to gain user trust and execute further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious login URL containing a redirectUri parameter that points to an attacker-controlled domain. For example, using `https://avideo.com/login?redirectUri=https://evil.com`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs the capability to craft a URL that includes the vulnerable `redirectUri` parameter with their malicious redirect target.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to induce a user to click or use the crafted malicious login URL.

**Technical Details:**

The commit `77e9aa6411ff4b97571eb82e587139ec05ff894c` addresses the open redirect vulnerability by replacing the regex check with a function call to `isSameDomain()`. This function ensures that the entire domain of the redirect URI is the same as the website's root URL.

The code change is as follows:
