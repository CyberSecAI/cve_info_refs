Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27781:

**Root Cause:**
- A flaw in the function that retrieves TLS server certificate chain information when using the NSS backend. Specifically, a malicious server could trigger an infinite busy-loop in libcurl when `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The vulnerability lies in a loop that does not terminate, causing the program to get stuck indefinitely.
- **Incorrect handling of server response:** A specially crafted server response can trigger the infinite loop due to the erroneous function behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, where the application using libcurl becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious TLS Server:** The attacker needs to control a TLS server that responds with a specific malicious response when `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` is used.
- **`CURLOPT_CERTINFO` Option Enabled:** The application using libcurl needs to have the `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` option set to 1 (enabled).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious TLS server that can respond to requests from libcurl.
- The attacker needs to induce the vulnerable application to connect to this malicious server and request certificate information using `CURLOPT_CERTINFO`.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to libcurl when built with NSS and does not affect the command line tool.
- The vulnerability was introduced in curl 7.34.0 when support for `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` using NSS was added.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The issue was resolved in curl 7.83.1

The provided content also lists the following information related to CVE-2022-27781:
- **Affected versions:** curl 7.34.0 to 7.83.0
- **Unaffected versions:** curl < 7.34.0 and >= 7.83.1
- **Solution:** Upgrade to curl 7.83.1 or apply the provided patch.
- **Workaround:** Do not use the `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` option.
