## CVE-2022-27778

# curl removes wrong file on error

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27778.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl might remove the wrong file when `--no-clobber` is
used together with `--remove-on-error`.

The `--remove-on-error` option tells curl to remove the
output file when it returns an error, and not leave a partial file
behind. The `--no-clobber` option prevents curl from
overwriting a file if it already exists, and instead appends a number to
the name to create a new unused filename.

If curl adds a number to not "clobber" the output and an error occurs
during transfer, the remove on error logic would remove the
*original* filename without the added number.

## INFO

This flaw is only present in the command line tool, not the
library.

This flaw was introduced in curl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) with the addition of these
two options that together created this problem. Since both these command
line options are brand new in this version, chances are not too many
users have actually had time to experience this problem.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27778 to this issue.

CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/08a96c6e4e6cf6a1917a1>

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/8c7ee9083d0d71>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use `--no-clobber` with
`--remove-on-error`

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 28, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27782

# TLS and SSH connection too eager reuse

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27782.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS
or SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited
reuse.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
several TLS and SSH settings were left out from the configuration match
checks, making them match too easily.

## INFO

Here are the list of options that were not considered in the check,
so curl would reuse a connection even if the subsequent transfer would
have changed one or more of these options.

### TLS options

* `[CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS.html)` (since [7.25.0](vuln-7.25.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_CRLFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CRLFILE.html)` (since [7.19.0](vuln-7.19.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME.html)` (since [7.21.4](vuln-7.21.4.html))
* `[CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD.html)` (since [7.21.4](vuln-7.21.4.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_CRLFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_CRLFILE.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_USERNAME](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_USERNAME.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))

### SSH options

* `[CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE.html)` (since [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html))
* `[CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE.html)` (since [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html))

This flaw was initially introduced in curl [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) and has been
widened several times since then. See table above for details

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27782 to this issue.

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2147284cad>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The two patches for CVE-2022-27782: [TLS-fix](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f18af4f874) and [SSH-fix](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/1645e9b44505abd5cbaf65da5282c3f33b5924a5)

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/1645e9b44505abd5cbaf65d>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 1, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
denial of service attack.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:

## CVE-2022-27780

# percent-encoded path separator in URL host

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27780.html)

## VULNERABILITY

The curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators
like '/' when decoding the hostname part of a URL, making it a
*different* URL using the wrong hostname when it is later
retrieved.

For example, a URL like `http://example.com%2F10.0.0.1/`,
would be allowed by the parser and get transposed into
`http://example.com/10.0.0.1/`. This flaw can be used to
circumvent filters, checks and more.

## INFO

This flaw was introduced in [commit
9a8564a920188e](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/9a8564a920188e), shipped in curl [7.80.0](vuln-7.80.0.html) when curl added support for
percent-encoded hostnames in URLs.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27780 to this issue.

CWE-177: Improper Handling of URL Encoding

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.80.0](vuln-7.80.0.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/9a8564a920188e>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The URL parser now rejects hostnames that percent-decode into URL
separator characters.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/914aaab9153764e>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 28, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-30115

# HSTS bypass via trailing dot

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-30115.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl's HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it to keep using
HTTP.

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly
instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is
provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in
the given URL used a trailing dot while not using one when it built the
HSTS cache. Or the other way around - by having the trailing dot in the
HSTS cache and *not* using the trailing dot in the URL.

Since trailing dots in hostnames are somewhat special, many sites
work equally fine with or without a trailing dot present.

## INFO

This flaw was introduced in [commit
b27ad8e1d3e68e](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e), shipped in curl [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) when the treatment of
trailing dot hostnames was changed.

Similar issues have been raised in the past for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-13/)
and for [Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=461481).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-30115 to this issue.

CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/fae6fea209a2d4d>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Stick to always using `HTTPS://` in URLs

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 3, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27781

# CERTINFO never-ending busy-loop

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27781.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl provides the `[CURLOPT_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CERTINFO.html)` option to allow
applications to request details to be returned about a TLS server's
certificate chain.

Due to an erroneous function, a malicious server could make libcurl
built with NSS get stuck in a never-ending busy-loop when trying to
retrieve that information.

## INFO

This flaw was introduced in in curl [7.34.0](vuln-7.34.0.html) when libcurl added support
for `[CURLOPT_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CERTINFO.html)` using NSS.

This feature is not accessible from the command line tool.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27781 to this issue.

CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.34.0](vuln-7.34.0.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.34.0](vuln-7.34.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f6c335d63f>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/5c7da89d404bf59>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use the `[CURLOPT_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CERTINFO.html)` option

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 30, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27779

# cookie for trailing dot TLD

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27779.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains
(TLDs) if the hostname is provided with a trailing dot.

curl can be told to receive and send cookies when communicating using
HTTP(S). curl's "cookie engine" can be built with or without [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) awareness. If
PSL support not provided, a more rudimentary check exists to at least
prevent cookies from being set on TLDs. This check was broken if the
hostname in the URL uses a trailing dot.

This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get
sent to a different and unrelated site or domain.

## INFO

This vulnerability only exists when curl is built without [libpsl](https://rockdaboot.github.io/libpsl/). Without this PSL
support built-in, curl is also destined to possibly leak cookies cross
sites simply due to how public suffixes work.

This flaw is similar to [CVE-2014-3620](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-3620.html),
although in 2014 curl did not have PSL support.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27779 to this issue.

CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) to and including curl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Build libcurl with libpsl support

D - Do not use cookies

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 28, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the

## Name

CURLOPT\_CERTINFO - request SSL certificate information

## Synopsis

```

#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode [curl_easy_setopt](curl_easy_setopt.html)(CURL *handle, [CURLOPT_CERTINFO](CURLOPT_CERTINFO.html), long certinfo);

```
## Description

Pass a long set to 1 to enable libcurl's certificate chain info gatherer. With this enabled, libcurl extracts lots of information and data about the certificates in the certificate chain used in the SSL connection. This data may then be retrieved after a transfer using [curl\_easy\_getinfo](./curl_easy_getinfo.html) and its option [CURLINFO\_CERTINFO](./CURLINFO_CERTINFO.html).

## Default

0

## Protocols

This functionality affects all TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.

This option works only with the following TLS backends: GnuTLS, OpenSSL, Schannel and Secure Transport

## Example

```

int main(void)
{
Â  CURL *curl = [curl_easy_init](curl_easy_init.html)();
Â  if(curl) {
Â    CURLcode res;
Â    [curl_easy_setopt](curl_easy_setopt.html)(curl, [CURLOPT_URL](CURLOPT_URL.html), "https://www.example.com/");

Â    /* connect to any HTTPS site, trusted or not */
Â    [curl_easy_setopt](curl_easy_setopt.html)(curl, [CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER](CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER.html), 0L);
Â    [curl_easy_setopt](curl_easy_setopt.html)(curl, [CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST](CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST.html), 0L);

Â    [curl_easy_setopt](curl_easy_setopt.html)(curl, [CURLOPT_CERTINFO](CURLOPT_CERTINFO.html), 1L);

Â    res = [curl_easy_perform](curl_easy_perform.html)(curl);

Â    if(!res) {
Â      struct curl_certinfo *ci;
Â      res = [curl_easy_getinfo](curl_easy_getinfo.html)(curl, [CURLINFO_CERTINFO](CURLINFO_CERTINFO.html), &ci);

Â      if(!res) {
Â        int i;
Â        printf("%d certs!\n", ci->num_of_certs);

Â        for(i = 0; i < ci->num_of_certs; i++) {
Â          struct curl_slist *slist;

Â          for(slist = ci->certinfo[i]; slist; slist = slist->next)
Â            printf("%s\n", slist->data);
Â        }
Â      }
Â    }
Â    [curl_easy_cleanup](curl_easy_cleanup.html)(curl);
Â  }
}

```
## History

Schannel support added in [7.50.0.](/ch/7.50.0..html) Secure Transport support added in [7.79.0.](/ch/7.79.0..html) mbedTLS support added in [8.9.0.](/ch/8.9.0..html)

## Availability

Added in curl [7.19.1](/ch/7.19.1.html)

## Return value
