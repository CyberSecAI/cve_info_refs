How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Description

Plausible Analytics is an easy-to-use, open source, lightweight (<1 KB) and privacy-friendly web analytics alternative to Google Analytics.

Plausible Analytics doesn’t use cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR. Made and hosted in the EU, powered by European-owned cloud infrastructure 🇪🇺.

Take a look at [the live demo](https://plausible.io/plausible.io).

**You need a subscription to Plausible Analytics to track your stats. There’s a free 30-day trial with no credit card required.**

We’re completely independent, self-funded, bootstrapped and debt-free. We’re not interested in raising funds or taking investment. We choose the subscription business model rather than surveillance capitalism. We’re operating a sustainable project funded solely by the fees that our subscribers pay us.

[Visit our website](https://plausible.io/) for full details.

### Why use Plausible?

Google Analytics is frustrating to use, difficult to understand, slow to load and privacy-invasive. That’s why we built Plausible Analytics, a simple but powerful, lightweight, open source and privacy-friendly alternative.

Here’s what makes Plausible a great Google Analytics alternative and why over 12,000 paying subscribers trust us with their website and business insights:

### Smooth transition from Google Analytics

Plausible features a realtime dashboard, entry pages report and integration with Search Console. You can track your paid campaigns and conversions. You can invite team members. You can even [import your historical stats from Google Analytics](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import). Learn how to get the most out of [your Plausible experience](https://plausible.io/docs/your-plausible-experience) and join thousands who have already migrated from Google Analytics.

### Simple analytics at a glance

Plausible is simple analytics. It is easy to understand and it cuts through the noise. Check your site traffic and get all the essential insights on one page in one minute. There are no layers of menus, there is no need for you to build custom reports, custom dashboards or PowerPoint documents.

### Lightweight script that keeps your site speed fast

Plausible is lightweight analytics. Our script is 45 times smaller than Google Analytics. Your page weight will be cut down, your site will load faster and you’ll reduce your carbon footprint for a greener and more sustainable web. A site with 10,000 monthly visitors can save 4.5 kg of CO2 emissions per year by switching.

### No need for cookie banners or GDPR consent

Plausible is privacy-friendly analytics. All the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously. Cookies are not used and no personal data is collected. There are no persistent identifiers. No cross-site or cross-device tracking either. Your site data is not used for any other purposes. All visitor data is exclusively processed with servers owned and operated by European companies and it never leaves the EU.

### Track events and marketing campaigns

Plausible is useful. Segment your audience by any metric you click on. Answer the important questions about your visitors, content and referral sources. Analyze paid campaigns using UTM parameters. Track site search terms, outbound link clicks, file downloads, 404 error pages, post authors, post categories and custom taxonomies without manually configuring anything or writing any code.

### Built-in WooCommerce analytics

Plausible provides an automatic WooCommerce analytics solution to track conversions, revenue and attribution. Activities tracked include adding to cart, removing from cart, entering checkout and completing a purchase. A purchase funnel looking at the user journey from viewing a product to making a purchase is enabled to help you see the drop-off rates between the different steps, understand your cart abandonment rate and increase your conversions.

### Invite team members and share your dashboard

Plausible is shareable. Your stats are private by default but you can choose to be transparent and make them public so anyone with your custom link can view them. You can also share your stats privately by generating a secure link. This link is impossible to guess but you can add password protection for extra security. You can invite team members and assign user roles too.

### Transparent and open source software

Plausible is open source analytics. Our source code is available and accessible on GitHub so anyone can read it, inspect it and review it to verify that our actions match with our words. We welcome feedback and have a public roadmap. If you’re happy to manage your own infrastructure, you can self-host Plausible too.

### Features

* Our product is updated several times per week and with our WordPress plugin you always have access to all the latest features
* Automatically includes tracking code in the header of your site
* Simple plugin settings page with easy options and an onboarding guide
* Get more accurate stats and count those who use adblockers by running the Plausible script as a first-party connection from your domain name

* Import your historical Google Analytics stats
* Keep an eye on your traffic with weekly and/or monthly email and Slack reports

## Installation

#### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Plausible Analytics, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click “Add New”.

In the search field type “Plausible Analytics” and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

#### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

## FAQ

For more information, visit the [Plausible Analytics website](https://plausible.io/). And for answers to all the frequently asked questions, [check out our documentation](https://plausible.io/docs).

### Why should I stop using Google Analytics on my website?

We may be biased but we don’t recommend you use Google Analytics on your WordPress site because of these reasons:

It’s owned by Google, the largest ad-tech company in the world

It’s a bloated script that affects your site speed

It’s overkill for the majority of site owners

It’s a liability considering GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulations

It uses cookies so you must obtain consent to store cookies

It’s blocked by many plugins and browsers so the data is not very accurate

It requires an extensive privacy policy

It’s abused by referral spam that skews the data

It’s a proprietary product so you need to put your trust in Google

It worsens the user experience due to the necessity for the annoying prompts

Read more: https://plausible.io/blog/best-wordpress-analytics-plugins

### Why is Plausible not free like Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is free because Google has built their company and their wealth by collecting and analyzing huge amounts of personal information from web users and using these personal and behavioral insights to sell advertisements.

With Plausible, you 100% own and control all of your website data. This data is not being shared with or sold to any third-parties. Since we don’t make money from targeted advertisement, we must charge a subscription fee.

Revenue from subscriptions is used to pay our rent, further develop Plausible and allow us to commit to Plausible and open source full time.

### Is there a demo available?

Yes, you can check out our demo at https://plausible.io/plausible.io

I hate when plugin providers don’t mention that the plugin requires 1. a registration on their website
2. a paid subscription after a short trial
How hard can it be to mention this right away to save users time and anger? I would never subscribe to any service where the provider isn’t up front and transparent about their business model.
Thanks for wasting my time.

Installation is quick and easy, and the interface is clean and user-friendly, perfect for both beginners and experts. By not using cookies and complying with GDPR, it ensures user privacy. Additionally, its impact on site performance is minimal due to its lightweight script. If you’re looking for a straightforward alternative to Google Analytics, Plausible is the ideal choice. Highly recommended!

I went with plausible for a simpler and privacy-focused alternative to GA and it does not disappoint. Clear analytics, simple to use, great for our users. When I encountered an issue after an update, they responded within minutes and helped troubleshoot. Can’t recommend it enough.

I am very impressed with this plugin. It provides an excellent range of information to review on a daily basis, without being cumbersome. It lets me keep a finger on the pulse of my website, and provides an interconnectivity with users that is natural and intuitive. When you put a lot of work into a website, it so important to find a way to track visitors to the site, without getting buried in the analytics, and a confusing set of directions. In my opinion, the developers of this plugin are brilliant. They clearly know what they are doing. They have a grassroots type approach, and treat you like a real person when you contact them. I would give them a five star review any day of the week, and am so glad I found this option for tracking visitors on my website. It’s by far the best tracking plugin I have used thus far, over a period of ten years. All I can say is thank you!

### [Light and Simple!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/light-and-simple-13/)

August 15, 2023

OMGosh…with this latest update to an already confusing GA platform, I knew it was FINALLY time to wave goodbye to GA! How many man-hours have I wasted implementing reporting dashboards because Google changes their permissions and codes, etc. I was able to take my 75+ websites and implement this Plausible solutions…so lightweight and worthy of the nominal costs involved. I then created a master private page of all my accounts I can quickly scroll and see each accounts web traffic quickly. I also appreciate this company is in the EU and more compliant than here in the USA and also I can tell my customers their web analytics will not be sold to some 3rd party. Back in the day, you did GA because it was assumed this would net you better indexing…not so Joe! Thanks Plausible!

I’ve installed Plausible on 4 client sites. It’s GDPR privacy compliant, and really easy to use. You don’t have to worry about configuring anything, you just activate the plugin and click through the setup guide. You can import legacy data from Universal Analytics, or add a module that tracks PDF downloads. The plugins displays these statistics right in the WP Admin Panel: unique visitors, total visits, total pageviews, views per visit, bounce rate, visit duration. Top sources for incoming traffic, top pages visited, location of visitors, and visitor devices. You get a lot of information without any complicate setup, and the GUI is very simple to understand. It’s a paid service, but you’ll save money in setup time. Technical support is top-notch too.
