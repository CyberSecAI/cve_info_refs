### **[zerodaywolf](/zerodaywolf)** commented [Mar 10, 2022](#issue-1165259222)

| **Environment details** OrangeHRM version: 4.10 OrangeHRM source: Release build from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orangehrm) or Git clone Platform: Ubuntu PHP version: 7.3.33 Database and version: MariaDB 10.3 Web server: Apache 2.4.52  If applicable: Browser: Firefox  **Describe the bug** A user can create a timesheet for a specific week by using the "Add Timesheet" functionality, after which the timesheet is accessible for editing and submission under the dropdown menu.  It was observed that when the `employeeId` parameter was set to any valid user's employee ID, a timesheet was created in that employee's account. The application verifies if a user has a valid session, but does not verify if a user is authorised to create a timesheet for a different `employeeId`. It is also possible to find out whether a timesheet has already been created for a specific week, by analysing the HTTP response.  **To Reproduce**   1. Login to the OrangeHRM application as user A with `employeeId` as `2` 2. Navigate to "Dashboard" > "My Timesheet" 3. Click on "Add Timesheet" 4. Turn on Intercept in Burp Suite (or any other web proxy) 5. Click on the textbox and select any date, say 1900-03-02 6. Click on "Ok" 7. Go to the Burp Intercept tab and you will notice a GET request being made to the `/symfony/web/index.php/time/createTimesheet` endpoint 8. Modify the value of `employeeId` parameter to a user B's `employeeId`, `4` 9. Click on Forward and turn off Intercept 10. Login to user B's account 11. Navigate to "Dashboard" > "My Timesheet" 12. Click on the dropdown menu beside "Timesheet for Week" 13. Notice that a new entry has been created with the date 1900-03-02   **Expected behavior** "Credentials required" error.  **What do you see instead:** The response body contains the date of the entry (1900-02-26).  **Screenshots** [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37404408/157674202-7aaf746a-8444-48a2-b85c-9184cd598b0a.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37404408/157674347-2982e3df-8b9d-4a99-acc0-5fc48b40d6a0.png) |
