Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Incomplete access control checks when broadcasting configuration changes to active application instances.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information Disclosure. Configuration changes intended only for authenticated users were broadcast to all users, regardless of their authentication status.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive configuration settings that should only be visible to authenticated administrators.
*  **Attack vectors:** An attacker can intercept the broadcasted configuration settings via network sniffing since the updates are sent to all connected clients.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network communications of the Zammad application. They don't necessarily need to be authenticated users of Zammad.

The content provides more details than the official CVE description, explaining that the vulnerability is due to the broadcasting of admin configuration changes without proper access control, leading to information disclosure.
