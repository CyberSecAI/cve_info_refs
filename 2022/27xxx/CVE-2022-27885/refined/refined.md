Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization/validation in multiple areas of the `maccms10` web application. Specifically, user-supplied data in URL parameters is reflected in the HTML output without escaping or filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerable parameters are:
   - `select`, `input` in `admin/art/data.html` and `admin/website/data.html`
   - `wd` in `admin/plog/index.html` and `admin/ulog/index.html`
   - `repeat` in `admin/vod/data.html`

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL. This can lead to:
   - Cookie theft: As demonstrated in the provided text, an attacker can steal administrator cookies, potentially gaining complete control over the application.
   - Session hijacking: By stealing session cookies, an attacker can impersonate the victim.
   - Phishing: Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login prompts.
   - Defacement: The application's content can be manipulated.
   - Other malicious activities: An attacker can perform any action the user can within the context of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
   - Crafted URLs: The primary attack vector is through carefully crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript in vulnerable parameters.
   - Social engineering: Attackers can trick victims into clicking on these malicious URLs through various means (e.g. phishing emails, malicious links on forums, etc.).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
   - The attacker needs to persuade a user (especially an administrator) to visit the crafted URL. This can be achieved through social engineering.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It includes:
   - Specific vulnerable URLs and parameters.
   - A proof-of-concept demonstrating cookie theft.
   - Suggestions for remediation: HTML escaping and filtering based on a whitelist.

The vulnerability was reported and subsequently fixed by the maintainers.
