# [CA8268] Local privilege escalation vulnerabilities in installers for ESET products for Windows fixed

ESET Customer Advisory 2022-0009
May 9, 2022
Severity: High
#### Summary

ESET was made aware of two vulnerabilities in installers of its products for Windows that allow a user logged into the system to perform a privilege escalation attack by misusing the Repair and Uninstall options. ESET released an automatic module update to cover these vulnerabilities in already installed eligible products and released fixed product installers.

#### Details

**CVE-2021-37851** allows a user who is logged into the system to perform a privilege escalation attack by exploiting the repair feature of the installer to run malicious code with higher privileges.

The CVSS v3 base score for CVE-2021-37851 is 7.3 with the following vector [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

**CVE-2022-27167** affects the Repair and Uninstall options and exploiting it may lead to arbitrary file deletion.

The CVSS v3 base score for CVE-2022-27167 is 7.1 with the following vector [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing exploits that take advantage of these vulnerabilities in the wild.

#### Solution

ESET released an update of the Antivirus and antispyware scanner module to cover these vulnerabilities in already installed products, which was distributed automatically. ESET also released fixed builds of its products for Windows.

Since installed products receive the patch via the Antivirus and antispyware scanner module update, users with ESET products installed do not need to take any action regarding these vulnerabilities. For new installations, we recommend using the latest installers downloaded from the [ESET website](https://www.eset.com) or the ESET repository.

The issues are resolved in the following modules and builds:

* Antivirus and antispyware scanner module 1587 was released on March 31, 2022, for products in Full and Limited support, according to [ESET’s End of Life policy](https://support-eol.eset.com/en/policy_business/product_tables.html). Note that this module update is downloaded by ESET products automatically along with Detection Engine updates.
