  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack can be initiated by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, leading them to unintentionally make a request to the vulnerable plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into making a request to the vulnerable plugin. This could be achieved through social engineering or by compromising another website that the target user may visit."
