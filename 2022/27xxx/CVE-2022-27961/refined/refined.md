Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the user comment function of the OFCMS system. The system fails to escape or sanitize user-provided input within the comment_content parameter of the API endpoint, `GET /ofcms/api/v1/comment/save.json`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability.  The system saves the unsanitized user-provided data, and when that data is rendered on the page, it executes as code.
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The comment function does not require login verification, allowing unauthenticated users to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the user's browser session when they visit the page where the injected comment is displayed.
- **Account Hijacking:** The attacker might be able to steal cookies, session information, or perform actions on behalf of a user if they interact with the injected XSS payload.
- **Malicious Content Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious content, redirect users to malicious sites, or modify page content.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a specially crafted GET request to the `/ofcms/api/v1/comment/save.json` endpoint.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `comment_content` parameter is the injection point for the XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **No Authentication Required:** No user authentication is needed to inject the malicious script since comment functionality does not have login verification.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected version is identified as v1.1.4 of the OFCMS system.
- The provided example exploit uses `<script>alert("xss")</script>` as the malicious payload. This is a basic example; a more sophisticated attacker can use more complex payloads.
