Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
denial of service attack.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

## CVE-2022-22576

# OAUTH2 bearer bypass in connection re-use

Project curl Security Advisory, April 27th 2022 - [Permalink](/docs/CVE-2022-22576.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl might reuse OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly
making sure that the connection was authenticated with the same
credentials as set for this transfer. This affects SASL-enabled
protocols: SMTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (OpenLDAP only).

libcurl maintains a pool of live connections after a transfer has
completed (sometimes called the connection cache). This pool of
connections is then gone through when a new transfer is requested and if
there is a live connection available that can be reused, it is preferred
instead of creating a new one.

Due to this security vulnerability, a connection that is successfully
created and authenticated with a username + OAUTH2 bearer could
subsequently be erroneously reused even for user + [other OAUTH2
bearer], even though that might not even be a valid bearer. This could
lead to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious
actor.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-22576 to this issue.

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.33.0](vuln-7.33.0.html) to and including [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.33.0](vuln-7.33.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/19a05c908f7d8b>

Note that libcurl is used by many applications, but not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/852aa5ad351ea53e5f>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

C - Set the bearer string as password *as well* when using
OAUTH2 bearer authentication with these protocols.

## TIMELINE

It was first reported to the curl project on March 18 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on April 18.

libcurl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27776

# Auth/cookie leak on redirect

Project curl Security Advisory, April 27 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl might leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP
redirects to the same host but another port number.

When asked to send custom headers or cookies in its HTTP requests,
curl sends that set of headers only to the host which name is used in
the initial URL, so that redirects to other hosts make curl send the
data to those. However, due to a flawed check, curl wrongly also sends
that same set of headers to the hosts that are identical to the first
one but use a different port number or URL scheme. Contrary to
expectation and intention.

Sending the same set of headers to a server on a different port
number is a problem for applications that pass on custom
`Authorization:` or `Cookie:` headers, as those
headers often contain privacy sensitive information or data.

curl and libcurl have options that allow users to opt out from this
check, but that is not set by default.

## INFO

This flaw was added in curl 4.9 with the introduction of
`--location` and has been present in all libcurl versions
ever released. In July 2000 in the curl [7.1.1](vuln-7.1.1.html) release, [this commit](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/29eda80f9669f)
was the first version that attempted to avoid this, but the check has
been bad since then.

In 2018, [CVE-2018-1000007](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html)
was reported that partly addressed this area - but in an incomplete
way.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27776 to this issue.

CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl 4.9 to and including [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < 4.9 and curl >= [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ae1912cb0d494b48d>

Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

In curl version [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html), the same-host check is extended to check the
port number and protocol as well.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/6e659993952aa5f90f488>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not enable `[CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION.html)` if you pass on
custom `Authorization:` headers or cookies.

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 21, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on April 22.

libcurl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
denial of service attack.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.64.0-4+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## CVE-2018-1000007

# HTTP authentication leak in redirects

Project curl Security Advisory, January 24th 2018 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl might leak authentication data to third parties.

When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, curl sends
that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if
asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to
the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header
value.

Sending the same set of headers to subsequent hosts is in particular
a problem for applications that pass on custom
`Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains
privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to
impersonate the curl-using client's request.

## INFO

This bug has existed since before curl 6.0. It existed in the first
commit we have recorded in the project.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2018-1000007 to this issue.

CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl 6.0 to and including [7.57.0](vuln-7.57.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < 6.0 and curl >= [7.58.0](vuln-7.58.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ae1912cb0d494b48d514d>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such.

## SOLUTION

In curl version [7.58.0](vuln-7.58.0.html), custom `Authorization:` headers
are limited the same way other such headers is controlled within curl:
they are only sent to the host used in the original URL unless curl is
told that it is OK to pass on to others using the
`[CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH.html)` option.

**NOTE**: this solution creates a slight change in
behavior. Users who actually want to pass on the header to other hosts
now need to give curl that specific permission. You do this with [--location-trusted](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--location-trusted)
with the curl command line tool.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/af32cd3859336ab>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.58.0](vuln-7.58.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

C - Do not enable [CURLOPT\_FOLLOWLOCATION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION.html) if you pass on custom
Authorization headers

## TIMELINE

It was reported to the curl project on January 18, 2018

We contacted distros@openwall on January 19.

curl [7.58.0](vuln-7.58.0.html) was released on January 24 2018, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27775

# Bad local IPv6 connection reuse

Project curl Security Advisory, April 27 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27775.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequent transfers to reuse, if one of them matches the setup.

Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take
the IPv6 address zone id into account which could lead to libcurl
reusing the wrong connection when one transfer uses a zone id and a
subsequent transfer uses another (or no) zone id.

## INFO

Zone ids are only used for non-global scoped IPv6 addresses and they
are only used when specifying the address numerically.

This flaw has existed in curl since commit [2d0e9b40d3237b1](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2d0e9b40d3237b1),
shipped in libcurl [7.65.0](vuln-7.65.0.html), released on May 22 2019. Previous versions
instead do not accept URLs with zone ids.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27775 to this issue.

CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized
Actor

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.65.0](vuln-7.65.0.html) to and including [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.65.0](vuln-7.65.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2d0e9b40d3237b1>

Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/058f98dc3fe595f21dc26>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use non-global numerical IPv6 addresses in URLs to
curl

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 21, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on April 21.

libcurl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27774

# Credential leak on redirect

Project curl Security Advisory, April 27th 2022 - [Permalink](/docs/CVE-2022-27774.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl follows HTTP(S) redirects when asked to. curl also supports
authentication. When a user and password are provided for a URL with a
given hostname, curl makes an effort to not pass on those credentials to
other hosts in redirects unless given permission with a special
option.

This "same host check" has been flawed all since it was introduced.
It does not work on cross protocol redirects and it does not consider
different port numbers to be separate hosts. This leads to curl leaking
credentials to other servers when it follows redirects from auth
protected HTTP(S) URLs to other protocols and port numbers. It could
also leak the TLS SRP credentials this way.

By default, curl only allows redirects to HTTP(S) and FTP(S), but can
be asked to allow redirects to all protocols curl supports.

## INFO

This flaw was added in curl 4.9 with the introduction of
`--location` and has been present in all libcurl versions
ever released. In July 2000 in the curl [7.1.1](vuln-7.1.1.html) release, [this commit](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/29eda80f9669f)
was the first version that attempted to avoid this, but the check has
been bad since then.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27774 to this issue.

CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl 4.9 to and including [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < 4.9 and curl >= [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ae1912cb0d494b4>

Note that libcurl is used by many applications, but not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

There are two separate patches to apply for CVE-2022-27774: [the main
one](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/620ea21410030a997) and [the SRP
follow-up](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/139a54ed0a172ada).

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/139a54ed0a172ada>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)

B - Apply the patches to your version and rebuild

C - Switch off curl's automatic redirect following

## TIMELINE

It was first reported to the curl project on April 18 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on April 19.

libcurl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
