{
  "CVE-2022-27776": {
    "Root cause": "curl might leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number due to a flawed check.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The check for same host during redirects is flawed and does not account for different port numbers or URL schemes"
    ],
    "Impact": "Sensitive information such as Authorization or Cookie headers, which may contain private data, could be leaked to a server on a different port number or URL scheme during redirects.",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by controlling a server that responds with a redirect to a different port on the same host while the client is sending sensitive headers.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a server that is initially contacted by the vulnerable curl client and is able to send a redirect to another port on the same host"
  }
}
