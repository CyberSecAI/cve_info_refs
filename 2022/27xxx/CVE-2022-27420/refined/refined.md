{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly used in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in `patientsearch.php`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the underlying system depending on the database user permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the `patientsearch.php` file, specifically through the `patient_contact` parameter in an HTTP request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They would need to be able to craft malicious SQL payloads within the `patient_contact` parameter."
