- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices do not properly handle resources of ARP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper resource handling leading to a race condition (CWE-362).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a race condition that leads to a crash of the entire device, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending ARP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An adjacent attacker on the same network is required.
